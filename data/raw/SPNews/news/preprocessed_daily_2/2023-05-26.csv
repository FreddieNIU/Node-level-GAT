You should consider the Schwab U.S. Mid-Cap ETF (SCHM), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 01/13/2011.The fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $9.09 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Mid Cap BlendMid cap companies have market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. They usually have higher growth prospects than large cap companies and are less volatile than small cap companies. These types of companies, then, have a good balance of stability and growth potential.Typically holding a combination of both growth and value stocks, blend ETFs also demonstrate qualities seen in value and growth investments.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.75%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 20.10% of the portfolio. Financials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, First Solar Inc (FSLR) accounts for about 0.61% of total assets, followed by Steel Dynamics Inc (STLD) and Fair Isaac Corp (FICO).The top 10 holdings account for about 5.04% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHM seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Mid-Cap Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Mid-Cap Total Stock Market Index is a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index. The Index includes the mid-cap portion of the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index actually available to investors in the marketplace and includes the components ranked 501-1000 by full market capitalization.Story continuesThe ETF has added about 0.66% so far this year and is down about -1% in the last one year (as of 05/26/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $60.50 and $73.90.The ETF has a beta of 1.13 and standard deviation of 21.51% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 500 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab U.S. Mid-Cap ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SCHM is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF (VO) and the iShares Core S&amp;P Mid-Cap ETF (IJH) track a similar index. While Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF has $49.92 billion in assets, iShares Core S&amp;P Mid-Cap ETF has $63.86 billion. VO has an expense ratio of 0.04% and IJH charges 0.05%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The beginning of the week on May 22 saw a cautious tone in equity markets as President Joe Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy scheduled a meeting to address obstacles in the debt-ceiling negotiations. The discussions have been characterized by fluctuations between progress and deadlock, with time running out to reach an agreement. Stocks relinquished their gains on May 19 when Republicans temporarily withdrew from the talks. The urgency of the situation was emphasized on Sunday by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who expressed a low probability of the US being able to meet all its financial obligations by mid-June, reported Bloomberg.According to Bloomberg, oil prices stabilized in London on May 22 as financial markets remained uncertain while US lawmakers engaged in final negotiations to reach a resolution on the debt ceiling. Brent crude traded close to $75 per barrel, experiencing a decline of nearly 2% over the previous two sessions.Meanwhile, on the stock market front, financial services provider The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), luxury fashion holding company Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR), and technology company Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) recently came into the spotlight after receiving upgrades from analysts.Raymond James turned bullish on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), citing the tapering of client cash outflows at Schwab, which is expected to stabilize the company's balance sheet and net interest margin. On the other hand, Bernstein upgraded Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) after the company regained control over its inventory and strong demand for Coach products in China.

(NYSE:AGS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23PlayAGS, Inc. (NYSE:AGS) designs and supplies gaming products and services for the gaming industry in the United States and internationally. On May 15, Jefferies analyst David Katz raised his rating on PlayAGS, Inc. (NYSE:AGS) from Hold to Buy and increased the price target from $7 to $10, citing the company's Q1 report. According to the analyst's research note, PlayAGS, Inc. (NYSE:AGS) has been experiencing a growing momentum in its products over the past few quarters, and this trend is expected to continue. The firm views PlayAGS, Inc. (NYSE:AGS) and its competitors as undervalued, presenting an opportunity for investors in a small-cap stock. Furthermore, the firm states that PlayAGS, Inc. (NYSE:AGS) operations have improved compared to the past three years, overcoming the challenges faced in 2019 and during the COVID-19 pandemic.09. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA) is a global pharmaceutical company that produces and distributes generic and specialty medicines and biopharmaceutical products in North America, Europe, Israel, and other parts of the world.On May 18, Umer Raffat, an analyst at Evercore ISI, upgraded Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA) from In Line to Outperform without providing a specific price target. According to the analyst, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA) has made significant progress in recent years, with a 50% reduction in net debt and resolving its opioid lawsuits. Furthermore, the company's core business has generally stabilized. Raffat points out that an intriguing opportunity has emerged for Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA), as two branded programs are approaching important clinical milestones. Specifically, TL1A for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are expected to see key results next year. At the same time, long-acting olanzapine is anticipated to have a Phase 3 readout in the same timeframe. The analyst suggests that if either TL1A or long-acting olanzapine proves successful, the resulting upside would disproportionately benefit equity holders.08. Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR) is a travel services firm headquartered in Westlake, Texas. The firm operates a digital marketplace that enables cruise companies to list their tours and products and the general public to select the products they like. It has 16 different cruise lines on its platform.According to a research note issued on May 15, Bernstein upgraded Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR) rating from Underperform to Market Perform and set a price target of $3.50. The analyst acknowledges that the company still faces structural challenges but believes that a downside catalyst, in the form of a guidance cut, is now in the past. When initially covering Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR) earlier this year, Bernstein expressed concerns about the company's 2025 targets, considering them overly ambitious. However, according to Bernstein, the company subsequently implemented a cost-saving program of $200 million, which partially offset the impact of the guidance cut.07. Nevro Corp. (NYSE:NVRO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Oppenheimer upgraded Nevro Corp. (NYSE:NVRO) rating from Perform to Outperform on May 15, setting a price target of $40. The firm highlights that the stock trades at a discount of 2 times its sales compared to the overall industry. Oppenheimer believes that if the new CEO can implement positive changes in the sales and marketing strategies, it could help stabilize the Nevro Corp. (NYSE:NVRO) market share and potentially exceed expectations, which would be favorable. Additionally, the firm suggests that any complementary acquisitions or introducing new products could present interesting growth opportunities akin to call options.06. AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE:AVB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE:AVB) is a real estate investment trust that owns and operates apartments in cities such as New York and Seattle.

Considering AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE:AVB) portfolio, which is more focused on suburban properties, the firm believes that the REIT's strategic approach to its portfolio and development aligns well with the ongoing shift in demand, positioning it favorably to capitalize on this rotation.Here is what Baron Real Estate Fund has to say about AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE:AVB) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:âWe recently re-initiated a position inÂ AvalonBay Communities, Inc.Â The company is a REIT that owns and operates a $43 billion portfolio of high quality apartment assets, located primarily in the east and west coasts of the U.S. We believe its concentration in high-barrier-to-entry coastal markets and its mix of urban and suburban properties should lead to strong cash flow growth over time. AvalonBayâs investment grade rating provides it with a cost of debt advantage compared to private developers. Management has proven to be a capable acquirer and developer of apartment assets. We believe AvalonBayâs shares are trading at an attractive 25% discount to its private market value.âÂ Click to continue reading and see the Analysts are Upgrading These 5 Stocks.Â Suggested articles:15 Best Bank Stocks to Buy Now25 Largest Banks in the US by Asset Size10 Most Profitable Bank Stocks to Invest InDisclosure: None.

ARE announced the sale of its fully leased property at 11119 North Torrey Pines Road in its San Diego cluster to DivcoWest. This 72,506 rentable-square-foot (RSF) single-tenant property was sold for $86 million at a notable capitalization rate of 4.6%, underscoring the value of Alexandria's strategic asset recycling strategy.The sale marks the culmination of a successful redevelopment project. The property, purchased in 2007, was transformed into a Class A laboratory facility. The transaction adds to Alexandria's robust track record of value harvesting and recycling assets to fuel its value-creation development ventures.With a highly leased pipeline of 6.7 million RSF of current and near-term projects as of Mar 31, 2023, the company expects to generate more than $610 million of annual incremental net operating income, mainly starting from second-quarter 2023 through first-quarter 2026. This stand-alone asset sale supports its focus on aggregating mega campuses, setting the stage for new Class A life science campus assets.According to Peter M. Moglia, CEO of Alexandria, ""This sale also underscores our ability to monetize our investments at significant profit margins, even in challenging times, and enables the funding of the next generation of Class A life science campus assets.âLooking at the bigger picture, Alexandria is targeting $1.5 billion in dispositions and sales of partial interests in 2023, with roughly $865 million in transactions already completed or subject to signed letters of intent or purchase and sales agreements as of Apr 24, 2023. This strategy obviates the need for common equity issuance in 2023, further strengthening the company's financial standing.In summary, Alexandria's successful $86 million sale demonstrates its strategic asset recycling prowess by capitalizing on the high demand and valuation for its high-quality life science real estate assets. This transaction solidifies its status in the life science real estate niche and underscores its ability to extract value even in tough times. This prudent approach also affirms its commitment to growth and innovation, further strengthening its position in the market.

Aflac, Unum Group, Employers Holdings and AMERISAFE should continue benefiting from prudent underwriting standards. However, a rise in claims frequency could weigh on the positives.The industry has been witnessing soft pricing over the past several quarters, which is not expected to change any time soon. Nonetheless, a rise in claims, with business activities returning to normal levels, is likely to increase pricing for this industry. Also, the increasing adoption of technology in operations will help in the smooth functioning of the industry amid coronavirus-induced challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry comprises companies providing workersâ compensation insurance, mainly to employers operating in hazardous industries. These companies offer group, individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products. Workers' compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employeesâ pay.Claims are generally met by insurers or state-run workersâ compensation funds, benefiting both employers and employees. While it boosts employeesâ morale, and, in turn, productivity, employers stand to benefit from lower claims costs.As awareness about the benefits of having such coverage rises, the future of these insurers seems bright. Per reports published in IBISWorld, the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry is estimated to grow 0.9% to $55 billion in 2023 based on revenues.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Accident &amp; Health Insurance IndustryPricing Pressure to Continue: The worker compensation industry has been witnessing pricing pressure over the past several quarters. Given this soft pricing, efforts to retain market share will increase pricing pressure, which might curb top-line growth. With commercial and industrial activities back on track, the demand for insurance coverage is likely to be on the rise. SpendEdge estimates workers compensation insurance pricing to increase at a five-year (2022-2026) CAGR of 5.25%. Per a report published in Business Insurance, this line of business should continue to remain profitable in 2023 while rates continue to trend downward.Story continuesClaims Frequency Might Rise: The accident and health insurance space has witnessed growth over the years, primarily driven by an increase in benefits offered by employers. The right kind of workersâ compensation policy translates into personal care for injured workers, increased productivity, higher employee morale, lower turnover, reduced claims costs and less financial worry amid rising medical costs.Increasing underwriting exposure, sustained decrease in claims frequency rates attributable to a better working environment and conservative reserve levels have been boosting the industryâs performance. Per U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data in an AmTrust Financial report, workers over the age of 55 will increase to about 25% in 2024 from 21.7% in 2014. Thus, claims could rise based on the magnitude of severity, the report states.

Aflac AFL, Unum Group UNM, Employers Holdings EIG and AMERISAFE AMSF should continue benefiting from prudent underwriting standards. However, a rise in claims frequency could weigh on the positives.The industry has been witnessing soft pricing over the past several quarters, which is not expected to change any time soon. Nonetheless, a rise in claims, with business activities returning to normal levels, is likely to increase pricing for this industry. Also, the increasing adoption of technology in operations will help in the smooth functioning of the industry amid coronavirus-induced challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry comprises companies providing workersâ compensation insurance, mainly to employers operating in hazardous industries. These companies offer group, individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products. Workers' compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employeesâ pay. Claims are generally met by insurers or state-run workersâ compensation fund, benefiting both employers and employees. While it boosts employeesâ morale, and, in turn, productivity, employers stand to benefit from lower claims costs. As awareness about the benefits of having such coverage rises, the future of these insurers seems bright. Per reports published in IBISWorld, the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry is estimated to grow 0.9% to $55 billion in 2023 based on revenues.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Accident &amp; Health Insurance IndustryPricing Pressure to Continue: The worker compensation industry has been witnessing pricing pressure over the past several quarters. Given this soft pricing, efforts to retain market share will increase pricing pressure, which might curb top-line growth. With commercial and industrial activities back on track, the demand for insurance coverage is likely to be on the rise. SpendEdge estimates workers compensation insurance pricing to increase at a five-year (2022-2026) CAGR of 5.25%. Per a report published in Business Insurance, this line of business should continue to remain profitable in 2023 while rates continue to trend downward.Claims Frequency Might Rise: The accident and health insurance space has witnessed growth over the years, primarily driven by an increase in benefits offered by employers. The right kind of workersâ compensation policy translates into personal care for injured workers, increased productivity, higher employee morale, lower turnover, reduced claims costs and less financial worry amid rising medical costs. Increasing underwriting exposure, sustained decrease in claims frequency rates attributable to a better working environment and conservative reserve levels have been boosting the industryâs performance. Per U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data in an AmTrust Financial report, workers over the age of 55 will increase to about 25% in 2024 from 21.7% in 2014. Thus, claims could rise based on the magnitude of severity, the report states. Also, with business activities getting normal, claims may rise.Increasing Adoption of Technology: The industry is witnessing accelerated adoption of technology in operations. Telemedicine has gained pace amid the pandemic. Carriers started selling policies online that appealed to the tech-savvy population. Given the current pandemic, several organizations are working remotely to comply with social distancing norms. Electronic applications, e-signatures, electronic policy delivery, cloud computing and blockchain should help insurers gain a competitive edge.

11,112f5b14-cf46-3121-ba79-4dc1af4332f4,TMO,2023-05-26,Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) Has A Pretty Healthy Balance Sheet,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-nyse-tmo-120019320.html,1685102419,STORY,['TMO'],"[Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific What Is Thermo Fisher Scientific's Net Debt?As you can see below, at the end of April 2023, Thermo Fisher Scientific had US$35.1b of debt, up from US$33.1b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$3.48b, its net debt is less, at about US$31.6b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Thermo Fisher Scientific's LiabilitiesWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Thermo Fisher Scientific had liabilities of US$15.9b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$36.3b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$3.48b in cash and US$9.30b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$39.4b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.Given Thermo Fisher Scientific has a humongous market capitalization of US$200.8b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Thermo Fisher Scientific has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.9, which signals significant debt, but is still pretty reasonable for most types of business. But its EBIT was about 15.6 times its interest expense, implying the company isn't really paying a high cost to maintain that level of debt. Even were the low cost to prove unsustainable, that is a good sign. Importantly, Thermo Fisher Scientific's EBIT fell a jaw-dropping 26% in the last twelve months. If that earnings trend continues then paying off its debt will be about as easy as herding cats on to a roller coaster. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Thermo Fisher Scientific can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last three years, Thermo Fisher Scientific produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 75% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewThermo Fisher Scientific's EBIT growth rate was a real negative on this analysis, although the other factors we considered were considerably better. In particular, we are dazzled with its interest cover. When we consider all the factors mentioned above, we do feel a bit cautious about Thermo Fisher Scientific's use of debt. While debt does have its upside in higher potential returns, we think shareholders should definitely consider how debt levels might make the stock more risky. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Thermo Fisher Scientific  that you should be aware of.Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

Marshall Award for Innovation in Corporate Ethics.Originally published on U.S. Bank company blogWhen you think of ethics, a concept as old as time, you may not think of innovation. But as Katie Lawler, senior vice president and global chief ethics officer at U.S. Bank, will tell you, evolving how we think about ethics is innovative itself.Lawler, who was recently recognized by Ethics &amp; Compliance Initiative with its Carol R. Marshall Award for Innovation in Corporate Ethics, shared how she and her team are bringing innovative thinking to the bank and its 77,000 employees when it comes to doing the right thing.What does it mean to be innovative in a topic that is centuries old? Why is it important?I think it's going beyond your code of ethics, your employee ethics hotline and annual ethics course. It starts with looking at ethics as more than a set of rules.It's about recognizing that much of our behavior is driven by the work environment we are in and being intentional about shaping a culture that supports good decision making.When we created the Global Ethics Office, we started to look to organizational and behavioral psychology to understand how we might influence the environment for the better. We are learning from and partnering with the bank's behavioral scientists to understand what drives human behavior so we can be responsive to it.Can you give some examples of how you're innovating ethics at U.S. Bank?By incorporating psychological safety and behavioral science in how we think about ethics, we are focusing on creating the conditions for employees to be able to be at their best.We're working closely with our in-house behavioral scientists. We want people in this company to tell us when there's an issue, an opportunity, a mistake, a new way of doing things. So we started with behavior mapping - asking ourselves, ""What does it take for someone to come forward and speak up?"" Then, what are the barriers and obstacles, or where it could break down? What are some interventions we could test to address those barriers? How do we make the process of coming forward less intimidating, and how do we build positive reinforcement for doing so?Story continuesIn every language in the world, the word people use for whistleblower is negative. You think about rat, fink, narc, etc. So how do we flip that and give positive reinforcement for stepping forward? We know it can be as simple as saying ""thank you"" the minute someone speaks up.Telling the stories of how people spoke up and the positive impact it makes is important. So that's one of the projects we're working on with that team.We're also exploring the design of our tools for reporting ethics concerns so that it is less intimidating and helps people feel better and more comfortable with speaking up.Why is psychological safety in the workplace important? Are we seeing benefits?We had been talking about it for a while, but psychological safety really caught on for our teams during the pandemic. In a psychologically safe workplace, people feel they can be themselves, offer ideas, raise concerns, admit mistakes and offer new ideas. They aren't afraid of looking foolish, being viewed as negative, or being seen as difficult.Psychological safety helps create the culture of inclusion and belonging we're striving for, where every employee feels that their voice is welcome and wanted.Psychological safety also enables innovation. We know from research that your most innovative teams are those that are psychologically safe because people don't hold back their ideas out of fear. This concept is the soil for integrity, inclusion and innovation.Companies won't thrive if people are keeping their heads down trying not to make any waves.As a company, we're going through big changes with technology, evolving to meet changing customer needs. How do ethics and your role connect to our technology transformation?I'm part of our internal working group for responsible use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The work has accelerated in the last 18 months working with our Digital, Risk, Technology, Operations and Innovation teams.We're working on how we operationalize our principles and values for this transformation, to leverage new technologies in a responsible way.Our principles focus on fairness, transparency, explainability and avoiding harm.But we also have one that is about doing good. How can we use technology to better support the needs of our customers and actively do good? I think it is really important to think beyond doing no harm. If you only focus on avoiding harm, there is a risk that you do the minimum.When you think about doing good, creating benefit for stakeholders, that is where you get to the real power from operating with ethics, whether about AI or any other aspect of your operation.You were recognized with a personal award this year, and U.S. Bank was also named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies for the ninth consecutive year. What do you think drives this ongoing recognition?I think it comes back to the core culture at U.S. Bank. We're disciplined. We're thoughtful. As an organization, we have prided ourselves on being very customer focused.Look at our core values. Some companies' values are just words on paper, but our core values truly reflect who we are and who we strive to be.We're always trying to anticipate both on risk and the opportunity side what we need to be focused on to best serve customers and employees.I really think there's something special in this company from the top down. We're here to serve the customer and help them make their dreams come true, and we do that by doing the right thing every day.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/757289/Bringing-Innovation-to-the-Age-Old-Topic-of-Ethics]"
16,2f45c2d8-278b-3ad5-8e9d-3926ece58199,CF,2023-05-26,Wall Street Analysts Think CF (CF) Is a Good Investment: Is It?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-think-cf-133006758.html,1685021406,STORY,['CF'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about CF Industries (CF).CF currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.79, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.79 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 57.1% and 7.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CFBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CFCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for CF here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying CF, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is CF a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for CF, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 6% over the past month to $8.41.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for CF. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for CF with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.26bUS$1.48bUS$1.69bUS$1.79bUS$1.98bUS$2.12bUS$2.23bUS$2.33bUS$2.42bUS$2.50bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 7.01%Est @ 5.54%Est @ 4.51%Est @ 3.79%Est @ 3.29% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4% US$1.2kUS$1.3kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$13bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 Ã (1 + g) Ã· (r â g) = US$2.5bÃ (1 + 2.1%) Ã· (7.4%â 2.1%) = US$48bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$48bÃ· ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$24bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$37b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$81.7, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Edwards Lifesciences as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.892. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Edwards LifesciencesStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

20,923197f9-5699-485a-ab04-671f560764a2,WMT,2023-05-26,'We were arrogant': RHâs CEO says he raised already expensive furniture prices too much on shoppers,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-were-arrogant-rhs-ceo-says-he-raised-already-expensive-furniture-prices-too-much-on-shoppers-115001705.html,1685101801,STORY,"['RH', 'LOW', 'TGT', 'HD', 'WHR', 'WSM', 'WMT']","[Another earnings cycle brings another blunt call-out by outspoken furniture-hawking CEO Gary Friedman.After basically saying the housing market was crumbling under the weight of higher interest rates in a late March earnings call, RH's top exec said late Thursday he and his team overcharged rich people for already expensive furniture during the good times.""I think the world took prices up, and we all know that because inflation went to 40-year highs, right? And that is going to affect things. And I think we're probably somewhat too arrogant in our ability to raise pricing in an easy-demand environment,"" Friedman acknowledged. ""And as the easy demand environment has waned, and it's required us to kind of really challenge, is our value equation going to create the level of demand that we believe is right for the business?""Judging by the latest results from RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, consumers don't see the value in putting a $2,300 wood dining room table on a charge card with a much higher interest rate attached to it. That's especially as the housing market continues to be under pressure.The California-based furnishings retailer's first quarter sales tanked 23% year over year to $739.2 million, it reported Thursday. Gross profit margins dropped to 47% from 52.1% a year earlier.Friedman said RH will now move aggressively to pare down excess inventory this year by offering discounts, which will take a bite out of margins.Full-year adjusted operating margins are pegged in a range of 14.5% to 15.5%, down from 15% to 17%. Sales for the year were guided to $3 billion to $3.1 billion, up from $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion as Friedman bets consumers will bite at his promotions.""$1.5 billion in cash and $1.5 billion remaining in share repurchases create a floor for the stock, though we see limited upside given our view that 20% operating margins may not be on the table until 2025. We believe new product launches under the RH Contemporary line at more amenable price points will spur demand in the second half, but not enough to push above the midpoint of guidance,"" warned Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski in a research note.Story continuesRH's struggles in part reflect poor execution by Friedman, but also the realities of the changing housing markets. The dynamics have tripped up everyone from a high-end furniture seller in RH in the past year to appliance maker Whirlpool to home improvement sellers Home Depot and Lowe's.Existing home sales in April fell 3.4% from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. Home prices declined for the third consecutive month.A new Redfin report this week revealed that nationwide home prices in April notched their steepest decline in more than a decade, declining by $18,000. Median home prices fell in 45 out of more than 90 metro markets, the report found.""We're launching it [our new product line] into maybe the worst home environment at the high end that I've ever seen in my career. I've never seen luxury housing down at the levels we've seen from recent reports and we're at 20-year high interest rates,"" Friedman added on the call.The stage is set for a similar tone from Friedman three months from now.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

21,202e7b69-6721-33a6-92cb-f5c5f60b1fb7,WMT,2023-05-26,6 Companies Behind Walmartâs Great Value Brand Products,GOBankingRates,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/6-companies-behind-walmart-great-110116047.html,1685098876,STORY,['WMT'],"[bgwalker / iStock.comWalmartâs Great Value line of products spans hundreds of goods. This includes things like pasta, frozen meals, peanut butter, bread, desserts and canned goods. It even includes nonperishables like trash bags, light bulbs and other household products.Iâm a Financial Planning Expert: Here Are 5 Things You Should Never Spend Money on If You Want To Be RichMore:Â How To Build Your Savings From ScratchMany of these products are reasonably priced when compared to other brands. But what you might not realize is that Walmart does not make its Great Value brand itself. Instead, âGreat Valueâ is a labeling system under which companies like Sara Lee and ConAgra produce and release products for the retailer.Walmartâs Great Value Brand and Its PartnershipsA good partnership can help a company satisfy its customersâ needs and continue to be a staple in the industry. This is just as true with Walmart as it is with many other companies.Walmart has many partnerships with companies beyond those that work under the Great Value product line. This includes companies such as Apple, Dyson, Better Homes &amp; Gardens and KitchenAid.James Owen, marketing expert and founder of Click Intelligence, said, âWhen it comes to Walmartâs partnerships, one of the best is with Dyson, an innovative technology company celebrated for its revolutionary home appliances.âPhilip Bacon, marketing expert and founder of Bacon, said, âApple, a global leader in innovative handheld devices, has joined forces with Walmart to offer a comprehensive range of their popular products, including iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and Apple Watches. This partnership brings the latest technology and devices to Walmartâs vast customer base at competitive prices; and, by making Apple products accessible through Walmart, customers can conveniently explore and purchase cutting-edge devices that keep them connected, productive and entertained while going about their day-to-day grocery shopping.âStory continuesTake Our Poll: Are You Concerned About the Safety of Your Money in Your Bank Accounts?As for the Great Value brand, here are the biggest companies that have partnered with Walmart to provide inexpensive and useful products to its customers.Sara LeeSince its founding in 1939, Sara Lee has been a household name when it comes to frozen baked goods. Today, Sara Lee also produces Walmartâs Great Value bread. This includes the Great Value White Bread, Whole Wheat Bread and Sourdough Bread.You might still be able to find Sara Lee branded breads â and other goods â on Walmartâs shelves. However, the Great Value version of them is typically priced lower than the actual Sara Lee brand â despite using the same ingredients.Sara Lee is also behind several other Great Value products, including its coffee and K-cups. Itâs even responsible for making some of Walmartâs coffee cakes.ConagraEstablished in 1919, Conagra has since established a reputation as a giant in the goods industry. In fact, Conagra is one of the biggest private-label food companies in the United States with a net worth of $16.72 billion. It owns many well-known brands, including Health Choice, Slim Jim, Duncan Hines, and Reddi-Wip.Conagra produces a large selection of products, including some that fall under the Great Value banner. This includes canned meat â like Vienna sausages. It may also include certain types of flour.KelloggâsKelloggâs was founded in 1906. Since then, the company has been manufacturing and selling all types of foods, including popular cereals like Frosted Flakes, Corn Flakes, Raisin Bran and Rice Krispies.Along with this, Kelloggâs is behind some of the Great Value boxes of cereal you can find on Walmartâs shelves. The recipes and ingredients are slightly different between the two brands, but the Great Value line is marketed as a cheaper alternative to the more popular name-brand option.ZiplocZiploc, which launched in the 1960s, is known for its zippered bags. But the company might also produce bags under the Great Value name. Both items have a very similar design, quality and feel to them, which indicates a partnership between the two companies.Land OâLakesFounded in 1921, Land OâLakes is well known for its butter. As with Ziploc, thereâs no formal evidence that this company makes butter under the Great Value brand. However, itâs possible given the similarities between the two options.In ConclusionThe Great Value lineup of products is Walmartâs store brand, and one that lets other prominent suppliers and manufacturers sell their products at a cheaper price point. Walmart doesnât disclose all of the suppliers behind its Great Value line of products. However, many of these items still come at a great value for the cost.More From GOBankingRatesHouses in These Cities Are Suddenly BargainsSee GOBankingRates' Top 100 Most Influential Money Experts and Vote for Your Favorite3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,00048 Easy Things You Can Do To Live Better and Save MoneyThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 5 Companies Behind Walmartâs Great Value Brand Products]"
22,bc58a5f5-0ab8-32f7-8b89-89f7d9f7ef5a,WMT,2023-05-26,âMore Rate Hikes Are Comingâ: Here Are 2 Stocks Goldman Sachs Likes in This Market Environment,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/david-solomon-warns-inflation-stickier-004127652.html,1685061687,STORY,"['GS', 'FLYW', 'WMT']","[The US markets are showing some conflicting signs, making forecasting difficult. The main headwind, inflation, is down â but the labor market is strong, with unemployment falling and wages rising. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates at the fastest rate since the 1980s, bringing them from near-zero to more than 5% in the last 12 months, risking recession to try and keep a cap on prices.But will the Fedâs efforts come to naught? Interest rate increases tend to affect the markets with a lag of 12 to 18 months, and weâre seeing inflation coming down now â the last data, for April, showed a 4.9% annualized rate of increase, far down from last yearâs 9.1% peak. But that 4.9% is still more than double the Fedâs target rate.This is the background to recent comments from Goldman Sachs chief David Solomon who believes inflation still poses a significant challenge to the economy.âI sense that itâs going to be stickier, itâs come off its peak, but itâs going to be stickier and more resilient which is why weâre expecting that while the Fed may pause and will be data dependent, you might need to see higher rates to ultimately control it some more,â Solomon opined.In such a stickier inflationary environment, investors are naturally going to move toward defensive stocks â the ones that can show resistance to a downturn. Using the TipRanks platform, weâve pulled up details on two names that Goldman Sachs analysts are recommending as defensive equities. Here are the details.Flywire Corporation (FLYW)First up on our list is Flywire, an online payment processing service. The company took an interesting route into the crowded online payment niche, starting out as a specialist in the education sector. Since then, it has broadened its services to include payment processing across a global network, catering to the healthcare, travel, and B2B industries in addition to education. Flywire is equipped to handle customersâ verification and security compliance needs, operating in more than 140 currencies.Story continuesFlywire can boast of a truly worldwide reach, with over 3,300 business customers in 240 countries and territories. The company offers service and support in dozens of languages around the clock, making the payment process seamless from any perspective. In addition to major names like Mastercard, Visa, and AMEX, Flywire also partners with PayPal and Venmo.As a defensive stock, Flywire benefits from the global shift toward digital transactions and the paperless office. Businesses of all scales, from the smallest Mom &amp; Pop shops to industry giants like Mastercard, can realize efficiencies by switching from paper transactions to digital processing. Being an electronic payment specialist, Flywire is positioned advantageously at the right time and in the right place. The companyâs stock has risen approximately 21% this year, significantly outperforming the S&amp;P 500âs year-to-date gain of 8%. With clear indications of continued expansion in the digital payment sector, Flywire is strongly positioned to sustain its growth alongside its customer base.The headline result from the companyâs 1Q23 financial release tells the story: Flywireâs top line revenue grew 46% year-over-year, to reach $94.4 million â and it beat the forecast by almost $11.48 million. Like many tech firms, Flywire does run a net loss, but its Q1 EPS loss of 3 cents compared favorably to the 10-cent per share loss from the year-ago quarter â and it was 4 cents per share better than had been expected. Flywireâs adjusted EBITDA figure expanded dramatically y/y, from $1.9 million to $7 million. The highlights of Flywireâs first quarter included 170 new client signings, making 1Q23 the companyâs largest ever sales quarter.For Goldman Sachs, the key points here include Flywireâs strong defensive base, and its ability to generate growth in todayâs economy. Analyst Will Nance writes, âLooking ahead, we believe FLYWâs strong NRR track record, coupled with its commitment to consistent operating leverage, should position the company well to continue outperformance in the near term. In particular, we see the companyâs defensive business mix in education and healthcare as well positioned to absorb the potential for macro weakness for the remainder of this year.ââPutting it together,â the analyst summed up, âwith shares trading at 47x our 2024 EBITDA estimates, we believe valuation is attractive in the context of FLYWâs ~30-40% growth rates, its impressive rate margin expansion, and the sustainability of its strong NRRs as its record cohorts from recent years continue to ramp.âTaking this forward, Nance gives FLYW shares a Buy rating with a $38 price target that implies ~28% upside potential over the coming year. (To watch Nanceâs track record, click here)The Goldman take is hardly an outlier. Out of the 8 recent analyst reviews, there is a clear 7 to 1 breakdown in favor of Buy recommendations over Holds, indicating a Strong Buy consensus rating. Currently priced at $29.72, the stock holds an average price target of $35, pointing to an estimated 12-month upside of around 18%. (See FLYW stock forecast)Walmart, Inc. (WMT)Now weâll shift our focus from a cutting-edge fintech to one of the most traditional retailers of all: Walmart. Having grown from its humble Arkansas roots, Walmart has become the worldâs largest retail giant by revenue, generating over $611 billion in the 2023 fiscal year (covering the 12 months ending on January 31 of this calendar year). The company owns both the Walmart and Samâs Club retail chains, operating a wide range of supercenters, discount department stores, and grocery stores across the US and internationally. In total, Walmart has more than 10,500 stores in 24 countries and operates under 46 different names.Walmart recently released financial results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2024, and showed that it is maintaining its growth trajectory. The company reported total quarterly revenues of $152.3 billion, up 7.6% year-over-year and coming in $4.39 billion above the estimates. The companyâs non-GAAP EPS figure of $1.47 was 15 cents better than had been expected.Highlighted among the results were the US comp sales, which were up 7.4% y/y; eCommerce, which expanded an impressive 27%; and the global advertising business, which saw a 30% y/y increase.Also during fiscal Q1, Walmart returned $2.2 billion in capital to its shareholders. A large part of this came from the companyâs dividend, which was last declared at 57 cents per common share for a payout on May 30. While the annualized rate of $2.28 per share gives a modest yield of just 1.54%, investors should note the dividendâs reliability: Walmart has been making dividend payments since 2003, has not missed a quarter, and has been raising the payment every year.In addition to its classically defensive dividend payments, Walmart stock has shown an ability to grow even against strong headwinds.None of this has escaped the attention of Goldman analyst Kate McShane, who says of Walmart: âWe believe WMT is a stock that investors still want to own given its defensive qualities in the near term along with the improving profitability profile over the long term.âTo this end, the 5-star analyst rates WMT shares a Buy, and her price target, set at $176, suggests the stock will grow 20% in the year ahead. (To watch McShaneâs track record, click here)Wall Streetâs biggest names never lack for analyst interest, and Walmart is no exception. The shares have picked up 29 recent analyst reviews, including 24 Buys and just 5 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Walmart shares are currently trading at $146.16 and have an average price target of $165.64, implying a 13% gain on the one-year horizon.

Big swings after missing third quarter earnings estimates. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma has a closer look at the numbers. Pretty muted reaction here, Brooke.BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah, pretty muted reaction we saw after market trading, go down about 2% to 3%. But now largely flat here, but certainly giving us some color on how this consumer is doing as inflation continues to take a toll on consumers' wallets. We saw same store sales coming up 0.3%. US same store sales come in lower, down 0.1%. Canada down as well. And international growth, where Costco continues to make a big play and certainly try to boost its presence. They're coming higher, up 4/10 of a percent.Now, largely what we've been seeing lately as consumers switch to food and staples and move away from discretionary items, perhaps this a reflection of that, as noted in their April sales results. But in addition to that, we're also seeing Costco emphasize e-commerce sales, as they continue to make a play there. We do know that e-commerce sales dropped about 10% in the latest quarter.And in addition to that, also membership fees, something that analysts in the Street are watching closely. What we know is that membership fees are roughly changed or increased about every five years. They were last increased in June of 2017. And that would bring this next increase to right about now, 2023, while analysts on the Street are saying that they do, in fact, expect an increase soon.There was nothing in the release that indicate, of course, we have the call in just a few minutes. But what we do know is that those membership fees that are about 60 to 120, depending upon which one rose to $1.04 billion. And that's up from 9.8-- sorry, 984 billion last year, a year ago. And so largely, the Wall Street as well as Main Street looking for a key, a closer look at, you know, just as they do increase those membership fees.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: OK. Brooke, saying on retail, Walmart's annual shareholders' meeting quickly approaching. Know you're heading out there. What can we expect to hear from the retailer?BROOKE DIPALMA: You know, I'm not alone. And the only person heading out there, there are thousands of people who are gathering in Bentonville, Arkansas next week. And here are three key focus that the Street as well as associates are looking for updates on at Walmart really looking to tout automation, their alternative businesses like ad revenue, as well as the new market fulfillment center that they announced this week.Diving into that, what we know is that earlier this year and beginning of April, they did announce that they're investing heavily in automation. They said, by the year end of fiscal year 2026, it aims to have about 65% of its stores serviced by automation. So, of course, AI being a key word this earnings season. We certainly expect to see more there, as well as their alternate business, as the company looks to compete with Amazon.And the market fulfillment center, this is the first one ever. We're going to get a closer inside look at what exactly that fulfillment center looks like, attached to [? Azure, ?] as once again, they continue to compete with Amazon, especially online.AKIKO FUJITA: OK. We'll be looking out for your coverage. Brooke DiPalma, thanks so much for that.]"
25,2ee5fc67-4e51-464f-b97d-59824c907b6a,WMT,2023-05-26,Costco Q3 earnings miss estimates amid slower-than-expected sales growth,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/costco-earnings-125635034.html,1685046269,STORY,"['COST', 'WMT', 'BJ']","[Costco (COST) reported fiscal 2023 third-quarter earnings results Thursday after market close that missed analysts' expectations.Last quarter, same-store growth slowed compared to previous quarters with people spending less, particularly on big-ticket items, amid higher grocery prices. Total sales for the quarter increased 1.9% compared to last year, to $52.60 billion.Here's what Costco reported, compared to Wall Street estimates, based on Bloomberg consensus data:Revenue: $53.65 billion versus $54.66 billion expectedAdjusted earnings per share: $2.93 versus $3.30 expectedSame-store sales: up 0.30 % versus 2.91% expectedUnited States: down 0.1% versus up 2.44 expectedCanada: down 1.0% versus up 1.30 expectedOther international: up 4.10% versus up 4.48%Foot traffic ""remains pretty good,"" CFO Richard Galanti said on a call with investors. Traffic was up 4.8% globally and up 3.5% in the US during Q3. The average ticket was down though, 4.2% globally and down 3.5% in the US, ""in large part, from weakness in bigger ticket nonfood discretionary items,"" Galanti said.Big ticket, discretionary items, such as furniture, small electronics, jewelry, and hardware were down 17% from a year ago in-store and only made up 8% of warehouse (in-store) sales.Its e-commerce sales also came in lower, down 10.0%. Currently, it operates e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia. Big ticket items in e-commerce sales were down 20% year-over-year, but made up 55% of e-commerce sales.The company's international business continues to pick up momentum, however. As of Q3, there are 853 warehouses, including 587 in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, 107 in Canada, 40 in Mexico, 32 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom, 18 in Korea, 14 in Taiwan, 14 in Australia, four in Spain, three in China as it ramps up plans to grow its presence there, two in France, and one each in Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden.Story continuesMembership fees, a key revenue stream for the wholesale retailer, brought in $1.04 billion, a tick lower than Wall Street estimates of $1.05 billion, but higher than a year ago from $984 million. The company did not announce plans to raise membership fees in the imminent future though.Costco last raised membership prices â a Costco Gold Star membership costs $60 per year and an Executive Membership goes for $120 â in June 2017. The company typically raises prices every 5 years and seven months on average.In the earnings call, UBS Analyst Michael Lasser, who has a Buy rating on shares and recently wrote in a note to investors said that now would be a good time to raise membership fees, prodded Galanti to see if he agreed.Galanti had a witty response on the call. ""Nice try, Michael, but at the end of the day, with the headline being inflation, we feel very good about if we want to do it, can we do it without impacting, in any meaningful way, renewal rates or sign-ups or anything and at some point, we will. But our view right now is that we've got enough leverage out there to drive business and we feel that it's incumbent upon us to be that beacon of light to our members in terms of holding them for right now. It will be â it's not a matter of a big time, but we'll let you know as soon as we know.""This report comes as shares of Costco are up 5.8% year-to-date, outpacing its competitors. Shares of Sam's Club's parent company Walmart (WMT) are up 3.5% so far this year, and shares of BJ's are down 2.9% after it saw Q1 same-store sales growth come in shy of expectations.Meanwhile, big box retailers Target (TGT) and Walmart (WMT) beat same-store sales estimates in their recent quarterly results but also showed a similar slowdown in discretionary sales.Minneapolis, Minnesota, Costco Business Center.

This compares to loss of $0.44 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 105.88%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this clothing chain would post a loss of $0.59 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.75, delivering a surprise of -27.12%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Gap , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, posted revenues of $3.28 billion for the quarter ended April 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.37%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.48 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Gap shares have lost about 32.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.2%.What's Next for Gap?While Gap has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Gap: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.19 on $3.65 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.58 on $14.99 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Apparel and Shoes is currently in the bottom 25% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Nordstrom (JWN), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2023. The results are expected to be released on May 31.This department store operator is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -100%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Nordstrom's revenues are expected to be $3.11 billion, down 12.8% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis footwear and accessories retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.27 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -43.8%.Revenues are expected to be $763.46 million, down 8.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.03% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Designer Brands?For Designer Brands, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -7.41%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Designer Brands will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Designer Brands would post a loss of $0.02 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.07, delivering a surprise of +450%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Designer Brands doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, Nordstrom (JWN) is soon expected to post loss of $0.12 per share for the quarter ended April 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -100%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.11 billion, down 12.8% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Nordstrom has been revised 4.3% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -29.31%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nordstrom will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have lost about 1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Equity Residential due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Equity Residential Misses Q1 FFO Estimates, Revenues BeatEquity Residentialâs first-quarter 2023 normalized FFO per share of 87 cents increased 13% year over year but narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents.The rental income of $705.1 million increased 7.9% year over year and exceeded the consensus mark of $699.5 million. It also surpassed our estimate of $697.1 million.Results reflected continued healthy demand and lower-than-anticipated bad debt. EQR also noted that it experienced better payment and move-out activity related to delinquent residents than assumed in its February 2023 guidance.However, higher expenses due to repair and maintenance work resulting from severe California rain storms, coupled with increased property-related legal and administrative expenditures, acted as a dampener. Also, there was a contraction in physical occupancy.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues were up 9.2% year over year, driven by healthy demand and lower-than-anticipated bad debt. However, due to repair and maintenance expenses resulting from severe California rain storms and increased property-related legal and administrative expenses, same-store expenses flared up 7.2%. Consequently, same-store NOI jumped 10.2% year over year.The average rental rate increased 9.8% year over year to $2,968 in the quarter ended March. Meanwhile, the physical occupancy contracted 50 basis points (bps) to 95.9% for the same-store portfolio. Our estimate for the same was 95.7%.Same-store residential revenues were up 9.2% year over year, while expenses increased 7.2%. Consequently, same-store residential NOI expanded 10.2% year over year.The new lease change for its residential same-store properties was up 1.3%, while the renewal rate achieved by EQR was 6.2% for the first quarter. The blended rate for the quarter was 3.9%. The physical occupancy for this portfolio was 95.9%, up 10 bps sequentially.In the first quarter, Equity Residential did not acquire any operating properties. However, EQR sold a small portfolio of seven properties in Los Angeles, CA, comprising 247 apartment units for $135.3 million.Story continuesBalance SheetEquity Residential exited the first quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $133.46 million, up from $53.9 million recorded at the end of 2022.The net debt to normalized EBITDAre was 4.17X, which declined from 4.38X in the previous quarter. The unencumbered NOI as a percentage of the total NOI was 88.3% in the quarter compared with the 88.2% reported in the prior quarter.GuidanceFor the second quarter of 2023, EQR projects normalized FFO per share in the band of 91-95 cents.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresAt this time, Equity Residential has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions has been net zero. Notably, Equity Residential has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

38,4bacfb93-827f-3d20-ae6a-55923e3458e0,HBAN,2023-05-26,Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) Is Due To Pay A Dividend Of $0.155,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huntington-bancshares-nasdaq-hban-due-102136715.html,1685096496,STORY,['HBAN'],"[The board of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 3rd of July, with investors receiving $0.155 per share. The dividend yield will be 6.0% based on this payment which is still above the industry average.While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Huntington Bancshares' stock price has reduced by 32% in the last 3 months, which is not ideal for investors and can explain a sharp increase in the dividend yield. View our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares Huntington Bancshares' Dividend Forecasted To Be Well Covered By EarningsWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable.Having distributed dividends for at least 10 years, Huntington Bancshares has a long history of paying out a part of its earnings to shareholders. Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 39%, which means that Huntington Bancshares would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet.EPS is set to fall by 11.5% over the next 3 years. Fortunately, analysts forecast the future payout ratio to be 52% over the same time horizon, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendHuntington Bancshares Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.16, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.62. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 15% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.Story continuesWe Could See Huntington Bancshares' Dividend GrowingInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Huntington Bancshares has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 6.6% per annum. Huntington Bancshares definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.Huntington Bancshares Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Huntington Bancshares (of which 1 can't be ignored!) you should know about. Is Huntington Bancshares not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

Results have gained from robust demand and brand strength. It has been on track with its Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan.The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 90 cents for the fiscal fourth quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents. Also, the bottom line surged 83.7% year over year from 49 cents in the year-ago quarter.Net revenues grew 1% year over year to $1,541 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,470 million.

The metric came ahead of our estimate of $315.8 million. Comps in Asia were up 20%, backed by 20% growth in brick-and-mortar stores and a 19% increase in the digital business.Story continuesMarginsRalph Lauren's adjusted gross profit margin contracted 150 bps year over year on a reported basis but the metric remained almost flat on a cc basis to 63%. However, the metric expanded 170 bps from fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 on solid AUR growth, improved pricing, favorable product mix and reduced air freight costs.Adjusted operating expenses increased 3% from the year-ago period to $908 million in the fiscal fourth quarter, driven by higher compensation and variable selling expenses, partly offset by lower marketing expenses. Adjusted operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, contracted 280 bps to 57% in the reported quarter.The companyâs adjusted operating income was $74.9 million, up 38.2% from $289.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The adjusted operating margin expanded 130 bps year over year to 4.9%.Ralph Lauren Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Â Ralph Lauren Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Ralph Lauren Corporation QuoteFinancialsRalph Lauren ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1,529.3 million, total debt of $1,138.5 million and total shareholdersâ equity of $2,430.5 million.

This includes 20 bps of positive impacts of currency. The operating margin is forecast to expand 30-50 bps on a constant-currency basis, which includes a favorable impact of currency of 10 bps. Notably, it reported an operating margin is envisioned to expand 50-100 bps on a constant-currency basis, driven by solid AUR and lower freight costs, which more than offset continued product cost inflation. The metric includes 20 bps of adverse impacts of foreign currency. The fiscal 2024 tax rate is likely to be 24-25%.For the fiscal first quarter, the company anticipated revenues to be flat to up slightly on a constant-currency basis. On a reported basis, revenues are expected to be down slightly year over year. This includes approximately 150 basis points of negative foreign currency impact.The operating margin is predicted to expand 30-50 basis points in constant currency, driven by stronger gross margins. Gross margin expansion is expected to be driven by lower freight costs and continued AUR growth, partly offset by increased product costs. Both metrics are likely to witness 50 bps of adverse currency impacts each. Also, the tax rate is estimated to be 23-24%.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Crocs CROX, Royal Caribbean PVH and MGM Resorts MGM.MGM Resorts currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

41,f5484144-f2ef-387c-8149-65ad884f3965,MCHP,2023-05-26,2 Long-Term Bets for Struggling Semiconductor Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-long-term-bets-struggling-173900677.html,1685036340,STORY,"['ADI', 'MCHP', '^GSPC']","[The strong demand environment of the last few months has allowed several semiconductor players to enter into long-term, preferred supplier or other special relationships with customers. This has improved visibility for players and stabilized revenue streams. However, the industry remains supply constrained, which is a limiting factor. Growth prospects over the next 5-10 years are excellent, because of the adoption of new technologies like AI-ML, EVs, smart cities, IoT, etc.Â While the longer-term outlook is extremely bright, near-term concerns related to the Fed-engineered economic slowdown and supply challenges remain. The most likely result will be increased caution at customers, who could order closer to consumption, thus reducing visibility. But this should not be a deterrent considering that there are segments of the market that remain amazingly resilient. While we wait for a suitable entry point, there are a few stocks that could be worth keeping an eye on.Â These would be stocks like Analog Devices and Microchip Technology.About the IndustryThe electronic gadgets we use to accurately read our commands, and record, store, retrieve and process the information we throw at them run on semiconductor technology, whether analog (enabling the recording and measurement of real-world information), digital (processing information available in machine-readable language) or mixed signal (enabling conversion of analog signals to digital or digital to analog among other things). Most electronic gadgets use a combination of these components, whether in consumer, industrial, auto, medical, communications, or IoT and other markets.The industry is cyclical and prices are elastic. Players usually serve multiple markets that offset their individual seasonality, or focus on certain core markets for which they have highly differentiated technology and relationships.Major ThemesThis is likely to be a mixed year for semiconductor companies offering analog and mixed signal chips. Some end markets will be sluggish. PCs (gradual uptick expected in the second half on the enterprise side and continued softness on the consumer side) and smartphones (weak consumer spending due to inflation affecting disposable income, as well as greater propensity to consume things like leisure and travel) stand out here. However, other markets like automotive, communications (especially 5G), IoT, cloud, AI, industrial (including medical devices) are all expected to do well. Technological innovation in the form of the metaverse, digital health, EVs and other innovative transportation and sustainability considerations are other drivers. China opening up is a positive, but uncertainties related to dealing with China remain.Story continuesThe industry is likely to see continued operating challenges. Primary among these is the supply/demand imbalance that is leading to an inventory glut especially in DRAM and NAND chips that have not been consumed as PC and smartphone demand slumped. Since analog/mixed signal chips are used in combination with these chips, this inventory imbalance is also affecting the market. Data center demand is on a secular rise although tempered in the short term by increasing costs, a slowing economy and sustainability concerns. On the other hand, the shortage of chips for the automotive market remains (as some OEMs cut back production because they have an inventory mismatch that they want to clear first). The second half may be expected to be better than the first, partly because of increasing capacity and partly because of other factors such as the end of support for Windows 10 leading to another upgrade cycle in the PC market.An emerging issue that semiconductor players are particularly exposed to is geopolitical tensions. The semiconductor supply chain is globally distributed, which means that international relations need to be maintained to ensure that work continues without disruption. While the Russia-Ukraine war didnât have that much of an impact, the souring of relations between the U.S. and China is another story. If China really tries to take control of Taiwan as many experts expect it will, there could be a terrible war that will be highly disruptive of the global economy and especially of the chip sector. Thatâs because a leading share of advanced node chips are made on the island. Another geopolitical concern is the increasing awareness among all leading nations of the increasingly larger role that semiconductors are playing in AI-driven electronic weaponry and surveillance mechanisms. As the importance of semiconductors in defense grows, the need to onshore or near-shore production is being felt. This is leading to rebalancing of the semiconductor supply chain not with a cost-reduction perspective but with a far more strategic objective. So the government is trying to incentivize companies to build in the U.S. TSM, the main supplier to the U.S. is setting up in the country but the plan is to have this on a much larger scale. The CHIPS Act may help a difficult situation where increased capacity would depress prices while U.S. production would increase costs. In the meantime, the U.S. has ordered restrictions on trading with China, which is also a near-term headwind for players.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Near-Term WeaknessThe Zacks Semiconductor â Analog and Mixed industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #188, which places it in the bottom 25% of the 250 odd Zacks-classified industries.The groupâs Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates weak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industryâs positioning in the bottom 50% of Zacks-ranked industries is based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions over the past year, we see that analyst opinion about the 2023 outlook remains down from a year ago although there has been some improvement in recent months. The outlook for 2024 has weakened. Overall, the 2023 estimates have dropped 2.9% over the past year, while 2024 estimates have dropped 7.4%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, letâs take a look at the industryâs recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Stock Market Performance GoodThe Semiconductor â Analog and Mixed industry has traded at a premium to both the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&amp;P 500 starting from November. The broader sector was trailing both between November and March, but continued to improve thereafter.Overall, the industry gained 7.5% over the past year while the broader sector gained 9.2% and the S&amp;P 500 2.8%.One-Year Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIndustry's Current ValuationThe industry's valuation is inexpensive. On the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, the industry is trading at a 16.94X multiple, which is a discount to both the S&amp;P 500âs 18.48X and the broader computer and technology sectorâs 23.70X. At the current level, it is however trading at a slight premium to its median level of 16.70X over the past year.The industry has traded between the 13.80X and 18.56X multiples over the past year.Forward 12 Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) RatioZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research2 Stocks to Hold for the Long-TermAnalog Devices, Inc. (ADI): Analog Devices is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits for industrial, consumer, communications and automotive customers. Other than manufacturing at its facilities in the U.S., Ireland and Southeast Asia, it also outsources some production to outside foundries, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for front-end processing and third-party subcontractors for back-end operations.Analog Devicesâ strength in the more resilient industrial (over 50% revenue share) and automotive markets is proving to be helpful in the difficult operating climate we are seeing today. However, as the economy softens further in the second half of the year, demand in these markets is expected to moderate. Edge computing (emerging applications include Industry 4.0, Smart Energy Systems, Electric Vehicles, Advanced Connectivity and Immersive Consumer) and ubiquitous connectivity are secular drivers however, as they are shifting ever-increasing amounts of data processing to the Intelligent Edge. The edge is where the semiconductor content per dollar of capex continues to increase, and that is where ADI is focused.As far as operations are concerned, the company has been growing output both internally and at its foundry partners, which has led to continued reduction in lead times. Bookings remain lower than sales, which increases the risk of the company missing guidance. But while this is bringing down the backlog, at the current levels the backlog still represents nearly a yearâs sales.Analog Devices beat April quarter estimates by 2.9%. In the last 30 days, the 2023 and 2024 estimates of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have been stable.The shares are up 6.7% over the past year.Price and Consensus: ADIZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchÂ Microchip Technology Incorporated (MCHP): Microchip Technology Incorporated operates in the Americas, Europe and Asia. It develops, manufactures and sells smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions such as general purpose 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers; 32-bit embedded microprocessors; and specialized microcontrollers for automotive, industrial, computing, communications, lighting, power supplies, motor control, human machine interface, security, wired connectivity and wireless connectivity applications.The near-term outlook for Microchip isnât great. With fears of a slowing economy looming, customers are looking to push out orders, which the company has been to help them with their inventory positions. This situation is expected to continue in the current quarter, with a corresponding negative impact on sales. Additionally, with such a sizeable backlog, new orders have slowed down, further deteriorating the outlook. However, since Microchip mainly produces at trailing edge facilities which have been in short supply in the last two years, management expects that there isnât a lot of inventory buildup at customers. At the same time, with supply constraints easing, its lead times continue to improve and the company intends to bring lead times down to 26 weeks by the end of the year.The long-term outlook is excellent however. More than 50% of its backlog is non-cancellable under its Preferred Supply Program (PSP), which is great for stability and visibility. Management has also been focused on total system solutions and higher growth megatrends, which has translated into increased design wins and share gains, positioning it for strong growth once the economic situation turns.Investors would also be interested to know that its strong cash flows have enabled the company to pay down a substantial portion of its debt over the last few years and also pay a consistent dividend. The company recently announced a 38.8% increase in the dividend with plans to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders by the March 2025 quarter.Microchip beat estimates by 0.7% in the last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 has increased 5 cents (0.8%) in the last 30 days. The 2024 estimate increased 17 cents (2.7%) during the same period.#2 ranked Microchipâs shares are up 8.2% over the past year.Price and Consensus: MCHPZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

IT, driven by its large customer base courtesy of its high-quality research reports, has reported better-than-expected earnings in all four trailing quarters.Gartnerâs first-quarter 2023 earnings (excluding 49 cents from non-recurring items) per share of $2.88 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 41.2% and increased 23.6% year over year. Revenues of $1.41 billion beat the consensus estimate by 1.3% and improved 11.6% year over year on a reported basis and 14.3% on a foreign-currency-neutral basis.Driven by the above-mentioned tailwinds, Gartner has outperformed its industry in the past year, growing 28.5% compared with its industryâs 3.5% increase.Gartner, Inc. PriceÂ Gartner, Inc. PriceGartner, Inc. price | Gartner, Inc. QuoteÂ Current Situation of GartnerGartner serves a large addressable market, where the quality reports provided by the company are considered to be comprehensive, objective and independent. Further, these reports provide actionable insights to users. All these factors make Gartner indispensable to companies operating in different sectors, allowing them to earn a competitive advantage. The company also benefits from lower customer concentration which enables operating risks to be as low as possible.The acquisition of CEB further reinforces Gartnerâs market strength. The combination of the latterâs analyst-driven, syndicated research and advisory services with the formerâs best practice and talent management insights across a range of business functions is likely to provide a comprehensive and differentiated suite of services portfolio across the globe.Gartnerâs efforts to reward its shareholders are praiseworthy. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, Gartner repurchased 3.8 million, 7.3 million and 1.2 million shares for $1 billion, $1.7 billion, and $176.3 million, respectively. Such moves indicate the companyâs commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in business.Some Concerning PointsGartnerâs global presence exposes it to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations. Appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies impacts the companyâs results.Story continuesGartner's current ratio at the end of first-quarter 2023 was pegged at 0.84, lower than the current ratio of 0.70 reported at the end of the prior-year quarter.

One oil seep has so far been identified in the basin giving an indication of a petroleum system in the area,"" it added.A new hydrocarbon-rich area would help add to country's petroleum resources and potentially boost the viability of the refinery and a crude export pipeline under development.

""Without an effective price cap policy being enforced and adhered to, the price cap will be unsuccessful in its aim of lowering Putin's revenues to fuel the war against Ukraine.""In December, the European Union and G-7 countries banned companies in their jurisdictions from facilitating the export of Russian oil, unless it was sold for less than a $60 per barrel.For the first months of 2023, the price proved effective, as both the tax revenue on oil products and the price of Russia's Urals crude fell.But prices climbed above the cap in April, with European-owned and insured tankers still moving Russian oil, indicating enforcement was effective, CREA said.What's more, CREA pointed out that the European Union had not maintained its plan to revise the cap every two months, dulling its usefulness.The think tank proposed a price cap of $30 per barrel, which would be closer to Russia's production costs of $15 per barrel but still high enough to keep supplies flowing to global markets. A cap at that level would have slashed Russia's oil revenue by 37%, CREA estimated.""Unless the price cap coalition takes action, changes to Russia's oil taxation structure will force the price of Russian crude oil closer to international benchmarks, leading to further recovery of Russia's oil revenue, which would damage the impact and credibility of the sanctions,"" the report said.""Strengthened enforcement of the price caps and lower price cap levels are needed if the architects of the oil price cap policy want it to function as a credible policy and to lower Russia's oil export revenues.""Read the original article on Business Insider]"

U.S. West Texas Intermediate closed up 84 cents, or 1.2%, at $72.67 a barrel.On a weekly basis, both benchmarks posted a second week of gains with Brent climbing 1.7%, while WTI rose 1.6%.Still, markets remained cautious as debt talks may drag on and there are fresh worries about a Federal Reserve interest rate hike next month that would curb demand after strong U.S. consumer spending data and inflation readings.While it is possible negotiators will reach a deal on Friday to raise the U.S. government's $31.4 trillion debt ceiling, talks could easily spill over into the weekend, a Biden administration official said.Benchmarks had settled more than $2 per barrel lower on Thursday after Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak played down the prospect of further OPEC+ production cuts at its meeting in Vienna on June 4.Russia was leaning toward leaving oil production volumes unchanged because Moscow is content with current prices and output, three sources with knowledge of current Russian thinking told Reuters.That contrasted with earlier hints of possible output cuts from Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, de-facto leader of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), who warned short sellers to ""watch out.""Bets on falling oil prices have risen.""I think we all are on guard here ahead of next week's OPEC meeting,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital.Money managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to May 23, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.Meanwhile, U.S. demand for gasoline is expected to remain strong with motorist group AAA predicting the May 27-29 Memorial Day holiday weekend will be the third-busiest for auto travel since 2000.Story continuesOn the supply side, U.S. oil rigs fell five to 570 this week, according to a report from energy services firm Baker Hughes Co. In May, the oil count fell by 21 rigs, which was the biggest monthly drop since June 2020.However, slowing economic growth and sticky inflation in Europe has capped price gains, with Dutch Central Bank chief Klaas Knot saying the European Central Bank needs at least two more 25-basis-point interest rate hikes.(Reporting by Arathy Somasekhar in HoustonAdditional reporting by Shadia Nasralla and Trixie YapEditing by Mark Potter and Matthew Lewis)]"

Both contracts were set to end the week marginally higher.Crude prices reversed a bulk of their gains this week as fears of slowing economic growth largely offset signs of tightening U.S. supply and improving fuel demand in the worldâs largest oil consumer.Data on Thursday showed that Germany, Europeâs largest economy, entered a recession in the first quarter as high energy prices dented consumer spending and industrial production.Uncertainty over the U.S. debt ceiling also weighed ahead of a June 1 deadline for a U.S. default, as lawmakers gave no indication that a bipartisan deal was imminent.A U.S. debt default is likely to push the economy into recession and have a widespread impact on the global economy. The dollar surged to a two-month high on increased safe haven demand, further pressuring oil prices.Story continuesThis largely tied into concerns that slowing economic growth will stymie crude demand this year, which has kept oil prices depressed for most of the year. Crude prices are trading down about 6% so far in 2023.Fears of a new COVID-19 wave in China also weighed on sentiment, amid warnings that cases could peak by late-June. Markets feared more economic disruption in the country as it struggles to recover from three years of strict COVID lockdowns.Related ArticlesOil creeps lower ahead of more cues on OPEC, debt ceiling talksGold at 2-mth low as debt ceiling uncertainty fuels dollar demandUS oil and gas auction yields nearly $80 million for federal coffers]"

When we met last September here in New York, we outlined our ambition to become the world's leading luxury lifestyle company and build a business that lives up to the potential of our powerful brand.As we close out the first year of our Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan, we are particularly proud of the progress we have made on our strategic commitments in pursuit of this goal. Our teams around the world executed exceptionally well through a highly dynamic global operating environment to deliver another quarter and full year of strong performance. We over delivered on the top line this year with 10% constant currency growth, supported by all three regions. This included positive comps, further AUR growth, and brand-accretive ecosystem expansion across our top 30 cities.At the same time, we continue to balance this growth with a relentless focus on productivity and operational discipline. This is enabling us to fuel our long-term initiatives and also grow our profitability on a constant currency basis. As we called out at the beginning of fiscal '23, the global environment has been and continues to be choppy. Throughout this, our teams are demonstrating agility and flexibility to respond to evolving consumer demand and market dynamics.As we continue to drive our strategy of long-term brand elevation across every region and channel, overall, our performance this year underscore the general resilience of our core consumer, and growing desirability of our brand around the world. This translated to another quarter of double-digit AUR growth globally, even as we took targeted actions to keep our inventories clean and well positioned.We are well aware that a subset of our consumers who are more value-oriented are increasingly pressured by macro and inflationary headwinds. We expect these trends to persist in the near term, particularly in North America and Europe. While this demographic still represents a relatively high average household income, they are being more choiceful with their apparel dollars and seeking more value.In this context, we believe consumers will look to brands they know and trust and styles that have longevity beyond one season. In this environment, our roots in quality and timeless style are a competitive advantage and our growing brand desirability and value perception across all demographics support this.Turning to the fourth quarter, our successful performance was guided by our three strategic pillars of long-term growth and value creation. These are: first, Elevate and Energize Our Lifestyle Brand; second, drive the core and expand for more; and third, Win in Key Cities with Our Consumer Ecosystem. Let me take you through a few of the highlights across each of these strategic pillars.First, on our efforts to Elevate and Energize Our Lifestyle Brand. We remain committed to investing in our most powerful asset, our timeless iconic brand, to inspire and engage our consumers and ultimately drive lifetime value. We continue to build our brand desirability with consumers while also growing their value perception of Ralph Lauren. This is enabling us to grow both market share and AUR. Our value perception increased, while our lifetime consumer value grew high single digits for both the fourth quarter and full year as we focus on trading consumers in, across and up within our lifestyle portfolio.In the fourth quarter specifically, we drove a diverse range of brand activations underscoring the unique Ralph Lauren Lifestyle. First, we continue to strengthen our leadership in the world of sports, with our annual sponsorship of the Australian Open. Now in our third year, we significantly outperformed our plan on both sales and media impressions as we successfully leveraged our Encore presence as well as our authentic partnerships with celebrities and influencers globally.Our Lunar New Year activations across Asia included our successful Polo Bear campaigns with WeChat and Kakao, helping to drive 13% growth in social followers in the region, led by tenfold growth on Douyin. At the Oscars in March, we were proud to outfit social activist and Noble Prize winner, Malala Yousafzai in a custom Ralph Lauren collection silver sequence gown. This iconic moment resonated with consumers, garnering over 8 billion media impressions globally. And as we continue to reinforce our leading position in gaming and the metaverse, we partnered with Web3 community Poolsuite as part of our Miami ecosystem launch this spring. The immersive experience included exclusive digital Ralph Lauren outfits and our first ever NFTs co-designed with Poolsuite members.Together, these activations are both reengaging existing customers while also attracting new full-price consumers to our business. In our DTC businesses, we added 1 million new consumers in the fourth quarter for a total of more than 5 million new consumers this year, consistent with our targets. This continues to skew increasingly toward next-generation under 35 consumers with whom we also drove our largest increase in luxury perception over the past year.We reached 52 million social media followers globally, a high single-digit increase to last year driven by dynamic content on Instagram, TikTok, Weibo and other key platforms. And our online search trends continue to significantly outpace our peers across our top markets globally, driven once again by our core categories.Moving to our second key initiative, Drive the Core and Expand for More. Our goal of becoming the leading luxury lifestyle company starts with our unique brand positioning in the market, which stands for so much more than a single product or category. It stands for the dream of a better life. From elevated hybrid dressing to quiet luxury, Ralph and our creative teams are delivering sophisticated, timeless products to serve our consumers across their modern lifestyles. Starting with our iconic core products, which represent about 70% of sales and remain a consistent driver of our business season after season. Our core grew low double digits in the fourth quarter, led by our spring-ready cable knit sweaters, Polos, Oxford shirts, chino shorts, relaxed tailoring and silk blend shirts and day dresses. Our core also establishes the foundation and credibility to grow our high-potential categories. These include Women's, Outerwear and our emerging Home business. Together, these high potential categories increased low teens in the quarter.Women's, our largest long-term opportunity continued to strongly outpace total company performance. Our Accelerate plan focuses on trading her into the brand across categories and up to more elevated styles to drive lifetime value, with women's AUR up more than 20% in the fourth quarter. Our continued strong Women's performance was supported by strong growth in handbags as well as our global launch of Women's Polo intimates in March with a particularly strong start on ralphlauren.com. Other special releases this quarter included our Creed III movie collaboration featuring six limited edition looks worn by Michael B. Jordan in the film and account exclusive capsules targeted towards next-gen consumers, including our retro varsity release with ASOS, Polo Boxing Club collection with Musinsa in Korea and icons in Madras with Beams Japan.Looking ahead, we will continue to leverage the breadth of our brand and assortments to meet consumers' evolving lifestyles.Switching to our third key initiative, Win in Key Cities with Our Consumer Ecosystem. We continue to invest in our long-term strategy to develop our key city ecosystems around the world with a focus on elevating and connecting all our consumer touch points across every channel. Starting with digital. Sales for our total Ralph Lauren digital ecosystem, including our directly operated sites, departmentstore.com, pure players and social commerce, increased high single digits in constant currency this fiscal year.In the fourth quarter, our Asia digital ecosystem delivered the fastest growth globally. With our owned and wholesale digital channels, both contributing to 40% growth in the quarter. We were particularly encouraged by our strong Lunar New Year performance, which significantly outpaced peers, including Women's up more than 60% and continued elevation with double-digit AUR growth.As part of our fully connected ecosystems, we also continue to open new physical stores that enable consumers to engage directly with our brands around the world. We opened 21 new stores and concessions, focused on our top cities globally this quarter. With the majority again in Asia, particularly the Chinese mainland. We are strongly encouraged by our continued brand momentum in China following the countries reopening.Through 3 years of COVID disruptions, our teams worked with agility to build our brand presence in the market. And this year's outstanding performance was a testament to those efforts. We drove full year China sales up more than 20% in constant currency, including an acceleration in fourth quarter sales up over 40%. Looking ahead, we expect China to remain one of our fastest-growing markets. We opened two iconic World of Ralph Lauren stores in Asia this quarter in Shenzhen's [Luohu] Mall and Pitt Street in Sydney, representing the most elevated expression of our brand to date in Australia. And here in North America, we opened a new store in Miami's Design District, showcasing the modern elegance and exceptional craftsmanship of our luxury collections. All iIII of these iconic stores are parts of the top 30 cities we highlighted at Investor Day. They are designed to anchor our city presence and drive desirability and engagement with consumers.And finally, touching briefly on our enablers, in addition to our strategic priorities, our business continued to be supported by our five key enablers. Some of the achievements we were particularly proud of this year included: the launch of our first cradle-to-cradle certified product with our luxury gold cashmere sweater, being part of Fortune's world's most admired companies, moving to #2 from #6 last year for our sector and Fast Company's 2022 Brands That Matter List for a collaboration with Morehouse and Spelman Colleges.And finally, the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation's $25 million grant to fund five cancer centers in the U.S., including our newest center in Georgetown, which opened just a few weeks ago.In closing, Ralph and I are inspired by our team's performance this year, putting the company in a position of strength to deliver on our strategic commitments even through a volatile consumer backdrop. And as the global environment remains highly dynamic, our focus on offense, agility and pragmatism remains the backbone of our approach moving forward. This year's progress on our Accelerate plan demonstrates that we have the right plan in place even as we face a more pressured environment. We have diversified levers of growth across geography, channel and category, a broad lifestyle portfolio of products that consumers know and trust and that we are actively flexing with the consumers' evolving needs and strong foundational enablers to support long-term growth and value creation from our talented people, innovative technology and supply chain to our balance sheet and muscle of operational discipline.And of course, all of this is underpinned by the strength of Ralph's timeless vision and our iconic brand, which continues to invite people all over the world to step into their dreams. With that, I'll hand it over to Jane to discuss our financial results, and I'll join her at the end to answer your questions.Jane Hamilton NielsenThank you, Patrice, and good morning, everyone. We are encouraged by this year's progress on our Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan, which remains on track even with numerous macro challenges that our teams have faced this year. We leveraged our strong brand, multiple strategic growth drivers and superior operational capabilities to deliver strong financial results in a dynamic environment.For the full year, we delivered 10% revenue growth in constant currency, exceeding our guidance with growth in every region. We expanded operating margin and grew profits ahead of top line growth in constant dollars, consistent with our 3-year plan. Adjusted operating margin expanded to 13.7% in constant currency, with operating profit dollars up 15%. Our continued brand elevation and culture of cost discipline were key to our strong results and provided flexibility to more than offset softer gross margins as we focused on keeping inventories clean and well positioned in the marketplace.Operating with discipline will continue to be an important element of our long-term strategic plan with productivity helping to manage changing market dynamics and fuel our investments in sustainable long-term growth. And we continue to make important investments in our business while delivering strong shareholder returns, including more than $650 million this year in the form of our dividends and share repurchases.Exiting the year, we remain confident in both our strategic direction and our fortress foundation enablers, which are allowing us to drive our strategic initiatives even through times of uncertainty. Our full year and fourth quarter financial performance underscored this position of strength through dynamic times. Let me take you through some highlights from the quarter.Total company revenues in the fourth quarter increased 9% in constant currency, above our outlook, led by double-digit growth in Asia. Results included about 180 basis points of negative headwind from the shift of the post-Christmas sales week into the fiscal third quarter from our fourth quarter last year, as previously noted. Our digital ecosystem sales declined mid-single digits in constant currency. Q4 performance included lower European pure-play results as planned, following exceptionally strong performance last year coming out of the pandemic.Sales in our owned Ralph Lauren digital sites grew mid-single digits on top of 20% growth last year. As we continue to elevate this channel, our digital AUR grew mid-teens and our full price sales penetration increased meaningfully to last year. We plan to enhance the user experience with rich digital content and even greater customer personalization in fiscal '24.In addition to the AI machine learning capabilities, we've been utilizing for areas such as inventory optimization, forecasting and consumer engagement, we've started to leverage our early learnings to test generative AI across multiple areas of our business from copy editing and graphics to computer programming.Total company adjusted comparable gross margin was about flat in constant currency, in line with our guidance. Tailwinds from product mix elevation, AUR growth of 12% and lower air freight were offset by peak levels of raw material costs, notably cotton, targeted promotions to drive conversion with our more value-oriented consumers and keep inventories healthy and higher duties in Europe.Finally, freight turned to a 100 basis point benefit in the fourth quarter compared to an 80 basis point headwind for the full year. Despite cost turbulence, our adjusted gross margins are tracking ahead of fiscal '19 pre-pandemic levels and were 170 basis points higher in the fourth quarter and 320 basis points higher for the full year.Adjusted comparable operating margin was 6.1% in constant currency or 390 basis points increased to last year. Adjusted operating expenses declined 380 basis points to last year in constant currency. Marketing was 6% of sales on a more normalized cadence of planned spending compared to 10% in the prior year period. Full year marketing was 7% of sales, in line with our annual guidance as we continue to invest in key brand moments and innovative new platforms. Adjusted operating profit grew approximately 200% in the quarter.Moving to segment performance. The shift of post-Christmas sales from Q4 last year into Q3 this year had a disproportionate impact on both North America and Europe's fourth quarter results, particularly our retail channels. This shift represented about a 270 basis points of headwind to revenue growth in North America and 120 basis points impact on Europe.Starting with North America. Fourth quarter revenues increased 2%. Stronger wholesale growth was partially offset by retail headwinds. In North America retail, fourth quarter comps declined 4% on top of a strong 21% compared last year. Similar to recent trends, strong growth in our full-price stores was offset by softer performance in outlet and digital. North America retail AUR increased another mid-single digits on top of a robust 20% growth last year, reflecting our continued brand elevation efforts around product, distribution and marketing. This helped to mitigate targeted promotion focused on our more value-oriented consumers. Looking ahead, we expect this subsegment of consumers to remain more sensitive to near-term inflationary pressures and this is reflected in our continued caution through fiscal '24.Beyond these headwinds, we are confident in the region's long-term trajectory which was reinforced by improving North America brand health metrics this past year with our strongest growth in brand awareness, perception of value for money and luxury perception.In North America wholesale, revenues grew low double digits to last year as we return to a more normalized cadence of spring deliveries following last year's supply chain disruptions. This benefited our Q4 by about 12 points, and we'll have a roughly 13-point negative impact on our first quarter wholesale growth. Adjusting for the normalized shipment cadence, this implies underlying wholesale revenue flat to last year, similar to Q3 trends. Our wholesale AUR increased high single digits to last year as we continue to elevate product and take market share at key partners. The promotion cadence at wholesale was flat to last year, in line with our expectations.Moving on to Europe. Fourth quarter revenue increased 7% in constant currency. Retail comps increased 8% on top of a 77% post-COVID reopening comp last year. Brick-and-mortar comps were up 9%, driven by positive growth in both full-price stores and outlets, while digital comps grew mid-single digits. Europe AUR increased double digits in the quarter with strong growth across channels.Europe wholesale grew 3% in constant currency. This was ahead of our expectations. However, we remain cautious on the channel into fiscal '24 on softening reorder rates and digital pure-play performance, consistent with our previous comments.Turning to Asia. Revenue increased 29% in constant currency, ahead of our expectations with broad-based growth across each of our key markets led by China. China rebounded strongly to more than 40% growth in constant dollars following the loosening of the Zero COVID policies in the previous quarter, with consumers traveling domestically for the first time since the start of the pandemic.Our brand continues to show momentum following a strong Lunar New Year holiday. Korea and Japan also grew double digits on compelling assortments and brand engagement and as Japan lapped last year's COVID states of emergency.Despite meaningful COVID disruptions and foreign currency headwinds through this year, we delivered our highest ever operating profit in Asia in fiscal '23. This is a testament to the growing desirability and momentum of our brand, along with the agility of our teams as they continue to drive our key city ecosystem strategy across the region.Within our Other segment, licensing grew low single digits this quarter, slightly above our plan with encouraging results from our Chaps license and Polo Women's intimates launch. Looking ahead, we will fully transition out of our Lauren Men's suiting license in fiscal '24. While this will negatively impact our licensing revenues and overall company margins by about 20 basis points in fiscal '24, the move is consistent with our brand elevation strategy.Moving on to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be an important element of our fortress foundation, enabling us to balance strategic investments in our brand and business with returning cash to shareholders. We ended this year with $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.1 billion in total debt. We returned $653 million in the form of our dividends and share repurchases this year, consistent with our long-term targets.Net inventory increased 10% with growth moderating significantly on a sequential basis as we reduced goods in transit and return to a more normalized lead times following last year's supply chain disruptions. Inventory growth still reflects higher product costs and our ongoing strategy of product mix elevation. Inventory units declined approximately 5% to last year, and are healthy as we enter fiscal '24.That said, we continue to manage our inventory positions carefully, with the majority of our products still weighted to core and seasonless product that can be flexed with demand.Looking to fiscal '24, we expect inventory levels to continue to moderate through the year and ending below prior year levels.Looking ahead, our outlook contemplates a more pressured consumer spending environment, dynamic macroeconomic conditions and foreign currency volatility, among others. We continue to plan across a range of scenarios and our guidance represents our best assessment of market conditions and resulting consumer impacts. We are taking a pragmatic approach to our plan for this year which assumes continued momentum in the full-price channels and Asia, balanced with a more challenged value consumer backdrop in North America and Europe.With an intense focus on what we control from our core iconic products and continued investments in new consumer acquisition to judicious inventory planning and operating expense discipline, we remain committed to driving progress on our long-term growth and profitability trajectory despite the dynamic global environment. Importantly, we expect to deliver both revenue growth and margin expansion this year.For fiscal '24, we are guiding constant currency revenues to increase low single digits and foreign currency to benefit reported revenues by about 20 basis points. We currently expect growth to be led by Asia, up double digits followed by low single-digit growth in Europe and a low single-digit decline in North America based on softer spring trends and Q1 wholesale timing shifts. We expect operating margin to expand approximately 30 to 50 basis points in constant currency to 12.3% to 12.5%, driven by gross margin expansion of about 50 to 100 basis points.Foreign currency is expected to benefit operating margin by about 10 basis points this year. Relative to our Investor Day base period, this guidance implies about 80 to 100 basis points of operating margin expansion when compared to fiscal '22, holding currency constant, on track with our long-term targets. We expect gross margin to benefit from lower freight costs, continued AUR growth and favorable product, geographic and channel mix this year. Reduced freight costs are expected to benefit gross margin by at least 100 basis points this year. We expect these tailwinds to be partially offset by about 20 basis points of negative foreign currency impact, along with continued pressure from product costs, notably cotton, through the majority of the year.For the first quarter, we expect revenues to be flat to up slightly in constant currency. On a reported basis, including 150 basis points of currency headwind, we expect revenues to be down slightly. First quarter also includes approximately 220 basis points of negative impact from the normalized timing of spring wholesale shipments following last year's supply chain disruption noted earlier. The timing shift is expected to negatively impact our North America growth by about 5 points and North America wholesale growth by about 13 points before returning to more normalized trends in Q2.We expect first quarter operating margin expansion of about 30 to 50 basis points in constant currency, driven by gross margin expansion. We expect gross margins to be driven by lower freight, positive AUR growth and lower wholesale mix, partially offset by higher product costs. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact both operating and gross margins by about 50 basis points in the quarter.From a cadence perspective, we currently expect operating margin to decline in Q2 due to the timing of planned marketing and ecosystem investments and expand again in Q3 and Q4 to last year. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 25% for the full year and roughly 23% to 24% for the first quarter. And lastly, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $275 million to $300 million, in line with our long-term guidance of 4% to 5% of sales.In closing, led by Ralph's enduring vision, our brand continues to inspire consumers across every geography. Our dedicated passionate teams around the world are operating with commitment and agility to execute on our Next Great Chapter: Accelerate plan. We believe our elevated brand, clear strategy and targeted investments combined with our culture of operating discipline and fortress foundation enablers put us in a position of strength to continue to drive long-term value creation. And with that, let's open up the call for your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Matt Boss with JPMorgan.Matthew Robert Bosscongrats on a really nice quarter. So Patrice, how are you feeling today about your long-term Investor Day guidance exiting year 1? And can you help put us into context, just given the more challenged North American and European consumer that you called out for this year in the outlook? And then, Jane, could you just elaborate on your confidence in pricing power for the brand as you cited strong AUR as a continued driver for your gross margin outlook in FY '24?Patrice Jean Louis LouvetThank you, Matt, and good morning. Well, let me first reground us in the fact that we just finished an above algorithm year on revenue and on track on profit. So we continue to build our business for the long term. And this past year's progress puts us on the path to deliver on our long-term plan.So to answer your question very simply, our long-term ambitions have not changed. And this confidence is really grounded in a number of unique strengths which are particularly relevant in choppier environments; first of all, a brand that people love and desire that we are continuing to invest in. Second, core products that consumers know and trust that aren't based on seasonal fashion or trends. And we know that during choppier times, consumers tend to gravitate back to these more iconic categories and iconic products. And so for us here, think about Polo shirts, Oxford shirts, blazers, dresses and even ties are back.Third is strong operational fundamentals, which I think have been demonstrated throughout the past few years. Fourth is multiple growth levers, and you saw that play out in this quarter again. And then finally, a proven ability to flex to consumer demand. So these factors give us broad confidence that we continue to be on track with the goals that we laid out about 9 months ago.Now let me offer some perspective on how we're thinking about the consumer overall to the second part of your question, and I know this is a top of mind question for many of you on this call. First of all, I would say our core consumer is resilient. And we are seeing that around the world in Asia, in Europe and here in North America as well. And that segment is growing as we're bringing in new consumers into the Ralph Lauren family.The second point is that our consumers across every region are also responding well to our continued brand elevation strategy. This is evidenced by the fact that our brand desirability continues to strengthen, our value perception is growing, and we track this on a quarterly basis in our key markets. We're recruiting millions of new consumers, 5.2 million this past fiscal year, including growing our highest value consumers double digits, which we're particularly excited about. And all of this while expanding AUR plus 12% this quarter, plus 77% over the past 5 years.The third point I would call out is that we saw a lot of work to grow our consumer base outside of North America. And today, nearly half of our business is international and actually more than half of our profit is international. And as you saw in the last fiscal year, and particularly this last quarter, our Asia performance has been a real highlight. I'm very proud of the work that our teams have done across Asia and in particular in China and we anticipate another year of above algorithm growth there, broader Asia.And then finally, in North America specifically, there is continued divergence between our core high-value consumers and that subset us more value-oriented consumers that we called out in prior quarter. Clearly, those more value-oriented consumers for a smaller part of our customer base and getting smaller and smaller as we bring in higher -- more higher value consumers into the Ralph Lauren family are feeling increased pressure because of inflation, because of increased interest rates. And I think you've heard this from others as well. But we believe we've appropriately embedded this caution into our guide.So Matt, we know where we're headed. We feel good about the multiple drivers in place to get there. I think we have a strong track record as a team in the business, and we'll manage this year with agility again. Jane, over to you on pricing power.Jane Hamilton NielsenYes. Thank you. So Matt, I would say an emphatic yes. We have pricing power that we expect to continue into the future. And I can't think of a better proof point than we saw this year, putting up 12% AUR growth to offset inflation. But importantly, I think we are uniquely positioned as we go forward because our pricing power is grounded in our brand elevation journey, and a proven multiyear strategy of executing a pricing strategy with multiple levers, not just like-for-like pricing, but product elevation, category momentum and movement, structural geographic advantages that we have that are coming through in our consumer metrics. Our consumer value perception has never been higher despite the price increases that we've taken.Our perception as a luxury brand has continued to grow and continues to grow and is certainly where our strategy intends to continue. And our model gives us flexibility because we are keenly aware of where we are in the macroeconomic time frame. But our pricing model in its multiple levels gives us flexibility to meet consumers where they are, all while still elevating the brand and you'll see us do that into the coming year.OperatorThe next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS.Jay Daniel SoleI have a two-part question. The first part really follows up on some of the pricing comments you just made. How does this more pressured macro environment impact your overall brand elevation strategy. Are you taking a more flexible approach to pricing or discounting in this backdrop? And then the second question is, Jane, you talked about the fortress balance sheet the company has. How is that going to let you play offense? Patrice, I've heard you used this comment that you can play offense through this tough economic environment. But what does it going to allow you to do both from an operational standpoint and a sort of a return cash to shareholder standpoint in fiscal '24?Patrice Jean Louis LouvetSo I think it is fair to say that the environment has been more pressured. And listen, we expect it to stay volatile as we come into this new fiscal year. We are still -- you just heard that from Jane, we're still firmly committed to our elevation strategy, which we started well before COVID over 5 years ago. And why? Because it's working. The strategy has served us well through stronger and weaker macro backdrops. We're seeing strong consumer response to what we are doing.And I think it's pretty clear also to Matt's earlier question that our brands continue to have strong pricing power in the marketplace across every region, right? You saw AUR grew across every single region this past fiscal year, in this past quarter. And we believe this is becoming an even bigger differentiator for Ralph Lauren relative to peers in this environment. And we are guided by the consumer here, right? And as Jane mentioned, the consumer response to our brand elevation on product, on storytelling, on selling environment continues to be strong. And the AUR is an outcome of all of that, and we feel quite good about our ability to continue on this journey, and then Jane, I'll turn it over to you for some more color on the second part of Jay's question.Jane Hamilton NielsenSure. And Jay, I would just add to what Patrice said on our pricing journey, that you've seen us in the last two quarters to be flexible while still putting up double-digit AUR growth, be flexible to the need of the more value-oriented consumer. And as we think about the coming year, we've built that flexibility into the model based on what we're seeing in consumer trends. So we feel really good about that flexibility while still continuing obviously to elevate even in a difficult environment.And then your question on the balance sheet. The balance sheet honestly gives us the flexibility to be brave and do what we need to do for our business. So you saw us during COVID be able to hold inventory when demand was a little softer. The strength of our brands have such a core assortment allowed us to do that and to make sure that we could continue our elevation journey and not be forced in discounting. It allows us to be brave in investing during times of volatility, both in marketing, which you've seen us do consistently through this reset period, and we intend to continue to do even in our guidance today, we expect marketing to be up 7% -- to be up to 7% of sales as we move into the future and to invest ahead of return on growth drivers.You saw us do that on digital, invest in local sites that take some time to pay off, but are good for the long-term health of the brand and consumer outreach and invest in doors that we know will be a halo to the brand, attract consumers and be good investments over time. So we really do believe in it as an enabler.OperatorThe next question comes from John Kernan with TD Cowen.John David KernanCongrats for a nice quarter. Can you talk to just North America, in particular, a lot of us can see the macro environment here getting a little bit more difficult as we went through the spring. Just wondering what you're seeing in both the wholesale channel in North America, also the outlet retail channel and how that is informing your view for North America embedded in the guidance this year.Jane Hamilton NielsenSo what we see in wholesale is that, as we called out in the guidance, we do see a normalization of wholesale sales that were disrupted during the supply chain. And we expect that to be a heavy headwind in the first quarter. Now that's anomalous. We want to call it out. But underlying in terms of wholesale, we have seen some challenges in terms of replenishment orders and some caution in their more value-oriented consumers. So we've taken that into consideration as we've planned our inventories and know that they're taking a more cautious stance in both North America and in Europe, as they give us order -- as they place orders for receipts into spring. We've incorporated that into our guidance.We're more optimistic about certainly, what we've seen in our full-price store environment in North America, it's remained strong through this period, and we're encouraged by that. We are more cautious as we came into the fourth quarter in terms of the outlet consumer. We've been calling that out for several quarters, and we've incorporated that into our guidance as well. We are encouraged that we do see that all our consumers migrating up in terms of the categories that they're buying into. They're buying higher ticket items. Those value consumers are looking for a good deal, but we do see that migration up in terms of the product assortment, and we're adjusting our assortments accordingly. We did see basket growth and AUR growth across all our channels and are encouraged by that. We will follow that while being flexible for the consumers. But encouraged by the overall store environment, and we feel we have the tools to flexibly move through this environment.Patrice Jean Louis LouvetAnd then wholesale, I would add to that perspective that the brand elevation strategy that we're applying is playing out well in the wholesale environment in the U.S. Jane, you mentioned AUR. AUR up 8% in wholesale this past quarter in a relatively promotional environment. Over the long term, we've been growing share in Men's, in Women's, particularly strength recently in Women's and in Children's. And I think we're nicely aligned with the strategic direction of our key wholesale partners.OperatorThe next question comes from Chris Nardone with Bank of America.Christopher NardoneTo dive a little bit deeper into your outlook for your European wholesale business and also your direct-to-consumer business this year, in particular, how should we think about the slowdown you're seeing in digital business and how does that compare to maybe some of the underlying trends in your brick-and-mortar channel?Jane Hamilton NielsenSo broadly across Europe, we've been very pleased with our digital progress. We're up substantially in terms of where we were pre-COVID, it's been a source of strength for us. In terms of what we're seeing on our digital growth, we expect continued growth in digital at a more moderate pace for Europe, but continuing our AUR journey in that channel and strong performance.As we look at the wholesale channel in Europe, it is more elevated and healthier than what we've seen in North America but we have seen pressure from pure players. Now that's playing out in our digital ecosystem in Europe, and it's playing out in our wholesale business in Europe. We have adjusted our inventories accordingly and expect to continue to grow with them in the long term, but do see pressure in the near term from the pure players that will play both into our digital ecosystem growth and will -- and plays out in terms of our total wholesale growth in Europe. But overall, it's an elevated offer. We continue to like our market share gains in that channel and are continuing the journey, but the pure plays are the pressure point.Patrice Jean Louis LouvetAnd I would add that our biggest partner there is Zalando in Europe. Zalando is on the brand elevation strategy, pulling back on promotional [IT] and that's very consistent with where we want to take the brand in Europe. So strategically, we feel very good about the direction that Zalando is taking.OperatorThe next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.Dana Lauren TelseyTwo items that were called out, is one, marketing spend and one on raw material costs. How are those being planned in -- what does it look like for fiscal '24 compared to '23? And then Patrice, would love to hear your take, just expand a little bit on wholesale. How do you see the difference in the wholesale channel operating models, North America versus Europe versus Asia? And how you're planning the business?Patrice Jean Louis LouvetMaybe tag team on this. On marketing spend, as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, our strategy is to spend about 7% of revenue on marketing. That's roughly where we were this past fiscal year. That's where we will be this coming fiscal year. It won't necessarily play out exactly per quarter at 7% because obviously, we have fashion shows and those types of events that will skew the numbers in a particular quarter. But directionally, 7% of revenue, we expect modest revenue growth, so you can expect the absolute dollars of marketing spend to increase on the total brand. Jane, I'll let you do the raw materials.Jane Hamilton NielsenDana, what we see in raw materials is really actually encouraging. What we see in terms of tailwinds is that freight will go from about an 80 basis point headwind in fiscal '23 to about 100 basis point tailwind in fiscal '24. Now as we called out cotton inflation was at its peak in Q4 and we expect that to continue into Q1. But as we exit the year -- because we're long bought on cotton, about a year out.But as we exit the year, at the very end of the year, we will start to see cotton turn to an advantage in terms of raw materials. But we really won't realize that until fiscal '25. And so if you think about it in the big buckets, cotton and freight will sort of equalize each other. But we do see some other tailwinds in terms of our air freight is stabilized and won't be a pressure point. We expect to see continued product elevation and mix and structural advantages as Asia outgrows or leads to the growth from the rest of our regions. So we're very encouraged by what we can see and what we have visibility to now relative to the environment that we faced in fiscal '23.Patrice Jean Louis LouvetAnd then your question on wholesale. So just stepping back a little bit, our direction of travel from a strategic standpoint is to pivot the company further into DTC. Our DTC today is about 63%, 64% of -- for the total company. And as we guided during Investor Day, we expect the numbers to be north of that in the coming years. Now we believe wholesale -- quality wholesale has an important role to play in our go-to-market model as well. If you do the world tour, in Asia, most of our business, if not all of it, is concession. So to a large sense, actually a DTC business. It's nicely elevated. We had really nice momentum there, as you saw in the results that we just announced. And so we're focused on running the play and continuing to drive elevation there.In Europe, it is a mix of concessions and wholesale. And in Europe, what we're working on is continued elevation. There's been some really nice work done in Germany, in France, we're looking very good in France and had really nice performance this past year in France wholesale in the U.K. In Southern Europe, there's opportunity to elevate. So we're putting emphasis on customers like El Corte Ingles, right, to make sure that we show up the way we want to show up in the appropriate doors. And then as we were just talking earlier and Jane mentioned some of this on pure players, pure players are an important part of our wholesale business today. It will be even more important in the future. And I'm actually quite excited about some of the strategic pivots that some of the European pure players are doing because it really lines up nicely with our strategic approach. And I refer to an example earlier on that.And then as far as North America is concerned, kind of two tiers of wholesale last, right? Remember, we closed 66% of our wholesale doors over the past 3 or 4 years. The upper tier is performing quite strongly, and we feel good about the way we're positioned there. So think of the Sakstons midst the blooming deals of this world and this is still as we have talked about our core luxury consumer being quite resilient. As far as the premium tier is concerned, our focus is on share gain. These are players, I think that I would say if they were on this call that they're picking between the winners and the losers and they're putting investment behind the winners and pulling back on the losers. We are fortunate to be part of that winner's column based on our performance over the past few years, share growth, value creation, joint value creation with them. So we are benefiting from staffing investments from these partners. We're benefiting from capital investments from these partners as we continue to elevate our brand presence in these more limited doors given the number of doors that we've closed.And our focus is on share gain, right? And as I mentioned earlier, over the longer term, we are growing share across all three of our segments, and we have a number of initiatives in place to continue to drive that while driving brand elevation. And I'm pleased to see that our AUR was up 8%, high single digits, up 8% this past quarter, in an environment that's still relatively promotional. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of a sense of how we're thinking about the broader go-to-market strategy moving forward.OperatorThe next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with BNP Paribas.Laurent Andre VasilescuCongrats on a great quarter and a full year. Jane, I would love to get a little bit more color. Thanks for Dana's question on the bridge on the gross margin. But on the first quarter, can you maybe just kind of give us a little bit of a bracket on how we should think about gross margins? And then second, just following up on the Investor Day, I think you talked about $400 million plus of gross productivity gains. I think 2/3 of that coming from SG&amp;A. Can you maybe just tell us or share with us any further insights or any further confidence you have to achieve those productivity gains.Jane Hamilton NielsenSure. Let me just start with the gross margin guidance. First of all, I just want to be clear that our Investor Day guidance on gross margin is unchanged. And I think our guidance both this year and this quarter reaffirms that we will be back on track for making gross margin progress. As you think about the first quarter, some of the things that we have that will, for gross margin expansion of 50 to 100 basis points, will play out in the first quarter. We expect that we will still have some pressure from FX in the first quarter. And -- but we are very encouraged by our pricing power and by the plans that we have, that we'll be able to expand gross margin 30 to 50 basis points across the business. We have the AUR plans in place. We're basically offsetting inflation and we're continuing our journey to increase our -- both our category penetration in high-margin categories and our product penetration in the upper tiers of our product assortment.So we're very encouraged by that and expect the progress -- you'll start to see the progress that we've called out for fiscal '24 in Q1. And as we think about the $400 million that we committed to in Investor Day, we have achieved in fiscal '23, about 1/3 of that $400 million. So we're right on track for where we want to be. We expect another 1/3 or perhaps a little bit more in this year, in this FY '24. And so we're right on track with where we want to be for that $400 million commitment. We've -- we're on pace. And of course, as a cost discipline muscle, we are always looking for more. So we have a number of initiatives. I called out some in terms of AI that we're continuing to develop as we move forward and hope to overachieve as we move into -- through the strategic planning time line.Patrice Jean Louis LouvetAll right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today and we look forward to engaging with you at our Annual Shareholder Meeting and first quarter fiscal '24 earnings call in early August. Until then, take good care.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

And first up, shares of Ralph Lauren, a jump of just about 5% here, closing the day in the green after the luxury apparel and accessories company reported a big fiscal fourth-quarter profit beat and revenue that topped forecasts. It also posted a more than 30% jump in sales in China, with demand in the key luxury market rebounding sharply.They did see some weakness on a year-over-year basis when it comes to revenue in North America and in Europe. But again, it looks like the street's focusing on that beat, focusing on some of the strength, Akiko, that they are seeing over in Asia. We're looking at gains of just about 5%.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, regional breakdown's certainly really an interesting one for me. When you think about the luxury sector, Asia, largely China, was sort of the big driver pre-pandemic. That market has been shut down significantly since 2020. So the comps, when you think about it-- I mean, last year, we were still in a zero-COVID policy over in China. You can expect to see a big rebound there, but the 12.7% increase there in terms of net revenue in China, or at least Asia overall, certainly adding to the lift in the stock today.We are also checking in on shares of Toll Brothers, closing the day higher after RBC Capital Markets upgraded the homebuilder to outperform from sector perform. The firm noting sentiment around the stock is overly negative, and it is expecting outsize order growth. We've heard a lot about homebuilding this week, Seana, just about, number one, material costs, how that's been weighing on things, but also just the demand in the market, just given inventory.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. And we're seeing homebuilders having that edge there because of the fact that they're able to capture more of those potential buyers out there, given the fact that the inventory for existing homes is so bleak right now. When you take a look at this call from RBC, the analysts there citing the improved demand stronger orders and also the resilient margins that we are looking at with Toll Brothers.And this is a stock that has performed well since the start of the year. Year to date, we're looking at gains of just about 30%. On a one-year basis, you're looking at gains of about 41%. So housing market has a ways to go. We know inventory mismatch here, the bleak inventory picture, obviously, a huge challenge for housing. But Toll Brothers and many of the other homebuilders positioned well in order to capture some of that demand that's out there.]"

Shares have added about 1.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Moody's due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Moody's Q1 Earnings &amp; Revenues Beat, Costs Rise Y/YMoody's reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $2.99 per share, which handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.31. The bottom line also grew 3% from the year-ago quarter figure.Lower operating expenses and Moodyâs Analytics segmentâs solid performance supported Moodyâs results. The companyâs liquidity position was robust during the quarter. Yet, subdued issuance volume was a major headwind, which hurt Moodyâs top line.After taking into consideration certain non-recurring items, net income attributable to Moody's was $501 million or $2.72 per share, up from $498 million or $2.68 per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Down, Costs RiseQuarterly revenues were $1.47 billion, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.43 billion. The top line, however, declined 3% year over year. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted revenues by 2%.Total expenses were $916 million, up 6%.Adjusted operating income of $656 million was down 11%. Adjusted operating margin was 44.6%, down from 48.2% a year ago.Mixed Segment PerformanceMoodyâs Investors Service revenues declined 11% year over year to $733 million. The fall was mainly due to muted capital market activities. Foreign currency translation affected the segmentâs revenues by 1%.Moodyâs Analytics revenues grew 6% to $747 million. This was mainly driven by the steady demand for Know Your Customer solutions and credit research. Foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted the segmentâs revenues by 3%.Story continuesStrong Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2023, Moodyâs had total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.2 billion, up from $1.86 billion as of Dec 31, 2022.The company had $7.5 billion in outstanding debt and $1.25 billion in additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility.Share Repurchase UpdateDuring the quarter, Moody's repurchased 0.1 million shares at an average price of $297.30 per share.2023 GuidanceMoodyâs expects adjusted earnings in the range of $9.50-$10.00 per share, up from the earlier projection of $9.00-$9.50.

Further, the segmentâs organic Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) is projected to rise in the low-double-digit percent range.2022-2023 Geolocation Restructuring ProgramManagement expects the program to help the company further adapt to the new global workplace and talent realities. Also, the restructuring plan will accelerate a number of ongoing cost-efficiency initiatives, and includes real estate optimization and increased utilization of lower-cost operational hubs.The program is expected to result in annualized savings of $100-$135 million per year.The exit from certain leased office spaces is expected to result in $50-$70 million of pre-tax charges to either terminate or sublease the affected real estate leases.The program also includes $75-$100 million of pre-tax personnel-related restructuring charges, an amount that includes severance and related costs primarily determined under the companyâs existing severance plans.Cash outlays associated with the program are expected to be $75-$100 million, which are expected to be paid through 2024.The program is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2023.Medium-Term TargetsMoodyâs projects total revenue growth of at least 10%, with adjusted operating margin in the low-50s range.

62,db9d22ac-7dc7-325f-a0d1-cbdb7864b938,MRO,2023-05-26,Marathon Oil Corporation's (NYSE:MRO) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 64% Above Its Share Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-oil-corporations-nyse-mro-142517731.html,1685024717,STORY,['MRO'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Marathon Oil fair value estimate is US$39.45Current share price of US$24.02 suggests Marathon Oil is potentially 39% undervaluedOur fair value estimate is 21% higher than Marathon Oil's analyst price target of US$32.74Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Oil The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.27bUS$2.52bUS$2.34bUS$2.29bUS$2.23bUS$2.20bUS$2.19bUS$2.20bUS$2.23bUS$2.25bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x10Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -1.22%Est @ -0.22%Est @ 0.48%Est @ 0.97%Est @ 1.31% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$1.7kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$919US$844(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$14bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 Ã (1 + g) Ã· (r â g) = US$2.3bÃ (1 + 2.1%) Ã· (10%â 2.1%) = US$28bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$28bÃ· ( 1 + 10%)10= US$10bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$24b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$24.0, the company appears quite undervalued at a 39% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Marathon Oil as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.382. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Marathon OilStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Oil and Gas industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, InterDigital has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Motorola has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that IDCC likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than MSI has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.IDCC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.82, while MSI has a forward P/E of 25.24. We also note that IDCC has a PEG ratio of 0.99. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MSI currently has a PEG ratio of 2.80.Another notable valuation metric for IDCC is its P/B ratio of 3.62. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, MSI has a P/B of 191.01.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to IDCC's Value grade of B and MSI's Value grade of C.Story continuesIDCC has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than MSI, so it seems like value investors will conclude that IDCC is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 homeÂ The deal hasn't closed yet, but a lot has changed in the intervening 18 months.For one thing, the hype over the so-called metaverse has shriveled up and died. Facebook parent company Meta's big bet on the concept looks like a flop and the future of Microsoft's HoloLens augmented reality headsetâthe companyâs very ambitious, very expensive betÂ to provide a portal into these brave new digital worldsâis uncertain, as Microsoft lays off thousands of workers and seeks to cut costs in an uncertain economy.Instead of the metaverse, A.I. has emerged as the next game-changing technology, sucking up all the industry excitement and investment dollars. And, as it turns out, Microsoft is in a pretty good position for this next waveÂ thanks to its partnership, and investment, in OpenAI, the maker of generative A.I. megahits ChatGPT and DALL-E.All of this raises an obvious question: Why is Microsoft still trying to acquire Activision?Given that antitrust regulators in Britain and the U.S. have stated their intentions to block the deal, the question is even more pertinent. On Wednesday, Microsoft filed a lawsuit to challenge UK's effort to block the deal, and the company's trial with the U.S. FTC is set to start in August. Is this the fight Microsoft should be waging at this time, and is it worth all the cost in capital and attention that will be required to win? Perhaps this is a golden opportunity, albeit one with a $3 billion breakup fee, for Microsoft to walk away?Story continuesThe answer to all those questions is simple, and reveals much about Nadellaâs priorities. Microsoft canât afford not to go through with the deal. Why? Because Microsoft needs gamersâperhaps more than gamers need Microsoft.Microsoft needs a shot of credibilityDollar for dollar, gaming has never been Microsoftâs biggest business: While Microsoft doesnât break out specific revenue figures for gaming-related businesses, its most recent earnings report showed Xbox hardware revenue slumping, even as Xbox content and services revenue posted a modest gain. Putting dollars and cents aside, though, gaming is lowkey one of the most important businesses to Microsoftâs strategy, and itâs an area in which the tech giant desperately needs a win.Itâs no secret that Microsoftâs Xbox console has lagged far behind Sonyâs PlayStation for over a decade now. Microsoft chief gaming officer Phil Spencer himself acknowledged in a recent podcast appearance that thereâs currently no realistic way for the Xbox to overtake Nintendo or Sony in terms of console sales.Phil Spencer, executive vice president of Gaming for Microsoft Corp., speaks during the company's Xbox event ahead of the E3 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California, U.S., in Los Angeles, California, U.S., on Sunday, June 10, 2018. Xbox previewed a flurry of new titles and deals with studios as the video-gaming division of Microsoft looks to compete more intensely with Sony Corp.'s PlayStation and a resurgent Nintendo Co. Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesA big part of the problem is the games: Where Sony has delivered hit after hit with PlayStation-exclusive titles like âGod of War: Ragnarokâ and âHorizon Forbidden West,â Microsoft has struggled.Sure, there have been bright spots like âForza Horizon 5â and the ongoing success of the Microsoft-owned âMinecraft.â But theyâve been overshadowed by failures like would-be blockbuster âHalo Infinite,â which saw its star fade quickly after a promising launch. More recently, Microsoft suffered the embarrassment of an outright hostile reception to big-budget Xbox-exclusive title âRedfall.âAnd thatâs not to mention that Microsoft has essentially no presence in smartphone gaming, apart from the ongoing success of âMinecraft.â Microsoft would instantly become a power player in mobile gaming, thanks to lucrative Activision Blizzard-published titles like âCandy Crush Sagaâ and âDiablo Immortal.âSpeaking of smartphones, Microsoft has also been investing heavily in its Game Pass subscription service, which allows users to stream a vast-and-growing selection of Xbox games to almost any device with a web browser, including PCs, phones, and tablets. Adding Activision Blizzardâs roster of games to that catalog would only boost that initiative, and thus Microsoftâs reach outside of the core console market.Still, while the terms of Microsoftâs recent agreements with other platform holders means that youâll be able to find âCall of Dutyâ elsewhere, you can expect that if the deal goes through, some future Activision Blizzard titles will only be available on Xbox.In other words, successfully merging with Activision Blizzard would give Microsoft a shot of credibility in the video-game market at a time when it could really use some, and ensure that it retains a stronghold in the games market despite its Xbox console woes. That, in turn, is important because of the quietly critical role that gaming plays in Microsoftâs bigger picture.For Microsoft, gaming is no gameEven as the overall PC market has continued to slump, Microsoft Windows has remained the platform of choice for a large portion of serious gamers. Given Microsoftâs well-documented failures to build out a mobile operating system of its very own, that makes gamers a crucial constituency in the companyâs quest to make sure that Windows stays relevant in a world increasingly dominated by Apple iOS and Google Android.Buying Activision Blizzard is a signal to that market that Microsoft takes gaming seriously. Itâs likely that under Microsoftâs stewardship, major games from the publisher will continue to launch on PC alongside consoles like Xbox, ensuring that the platform stays vibrant. Itâs a pricey investment, and a painful one given the legal and regulatory hassles, but Microsoft has a vested interest in making sure gamers continue to choose Windows.A photo shows visitors playing the game Sea of Thieves of the Xbox booth at the Gamescom video game fair in Cologne on August 24, 2022. - According to the organisers, around 1,100 exhibitors from 53 countries will be presenting their products during the fair running until August 28, 2022. (Photo by Ina FASSBENDER / AFP) (Photo by INA FASSBENDER/AFP via Getty Images)And the Windows business could use the help. Per that most recent earnings statement, Windows OEM revenue â the licensing fees paid by PC manufacturers to Microsoft to pre-install Windows on their machines â dipped 28%, contributing to an overall 9% dip in Microsoftâs More Personal Computing business segment to $13.3 billion. If Microsoft has any hope of turning things around, it likely lies in large part by moving Windows to tap into the gaming market, which PwC estimates will be worth some $321 billion by 2026.Thereâs an old adage in the PC industry: people buy computers for productivity, but they upgrade for games. Gamers are generally more likely to buy software on their platform of choice, more likely to stick with that platform over the long term, and more likely to be highly-engaged users.In the medium term, Microsoft sees Windows as its gateway to services like the Microsoft 365 productivity suite, the Bing search engine, and the Edge browser. The more gamers tie themselves to Windows, the wider Microsoftâs funnel for those services becomes. In the longer run, Microsoft gets to build an important level of loyalty that may serve it well whatever comes next in tech.Thereâs also a future-looking component to this investment, too. While even Metaâs Mark Zuckerberg seems to have backed down on the hype around the metaverse, itâs important to remember that Nadella is also a big booster of the concept. And while the fully-realized virtual world predicted by books like âReady Player Oneâ is still far off, online video games like âFortniteâ or âRobloxâ are the closest things available today.In buying Activision Blizzard, Microsoft is also buying games like âWorld of Warcraftâ â one of the first truly successful virtual worlds, which almost two decades into its existence still sees an estimated two million-plus players log in every month.The game isnât quite the business-focused metaverse that Nadella has previously espoused. But if Nadella wants to meet users â particularly younger users â where theyâre at as they spend more time and money in virtual worlds, âWorld of Warcraftâ and Activision Blizzardâs other properties are a good start.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:Â 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per yearâall while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Users have found examples of racist or sexist outputs from AI software. Concerns are growing that AI working alongside search engines like Alphabet Incâs Google and Microsoft Corpâs Bing may produce incorrect information in a convincing fashion.OpenAI, backed by $10 billion from Microsoft, has been leading the call for regulation of AI. Yet it recently threatened to pull out of the European Union over proposed rules.""The current draft of the EU AI Act would be over-regulating, but we have heard it's going to get pulled back,"" OpenAIâs chief executive Sam Altman told Reuters. ""They are still talking about it.""The startupâs grants would not fund that much AI research. Salaries for AI engineers and others in the red-hot sector easily top $100,000 and can exceed $300,000.AI systems âshould benefit all of humanity and be shaped to be as inclusive as possible,"" OpenAI said in the blog post. ""We are launching this grant program to take a first step in this direction.""The San Francisco startup said results of the funding could shape its own views on AI governance, though it said no recommendations would be ""binding.""Altman has been a leading figure calling for regulation of AI, while simultaneously rolling out new updates to ChatGPT and image-generator DALL-E. This month he appeared before a U.S. Senate subcommittee, saying âif this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong.âStory continuesMicrosoft too has recently endorsed comprehensive regulation of AI even as it has vowed to insert the technology into its products, racing with OpenAI, Google and startups to offer AI to consumers and businesses.Nearly every sector has an interest in AI's potential to improve efficiency and cut labor costs, along with concerns AI could spread misinformation or factual inaccuracies, what industry insiders call âhallucinations.âAI is already behind several widely believed spoofs. One recent phony viral image of an explosion near the Pentagon briefly affected the stock market.Despite calls for greater regulation, Congress has failed to pass new legislation to meaningfully curtail Big Tech.

For a deeper dive into how we make our Pro Picks, read more here.Signet JewelersSignet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG) was snapped up by The Big Shortâs Michael Burry last quarter for a $9.7 million investment, or 9.1% of his Scion Capital portfolio. And itâs no wonder: The jewelry retailer boasts 375% growth in cumulative diluted earnings per share over the past three years, as well as exceptional free cash flow yield, both of which contribute to its excellent 3.38 InvestingPro financial health score. And Signet has been diligently returning cash to shareholders, bumping up its share-buyback program yet again in March to an authorization of $775 million. It also hiked its dividend for the second year running, now paying out a 1.3% annual yield to investors.Shares are up more than 7% for the year, and look to have plenty of runway left: both analysts and InvestingProâs fair value algorithm puts share upside at roughly 34% above current levels.Capital One FinancialMichael Burry also disclosed a $7.2 million stake in Capital One (NYSE:COF), or 6.7% of his portfolio. InvestingPro gives the credit card company a burly health score of 3.29 out of 5, supported by its sky-high earnings yield and free cash flow yield. Capital One has also been buying back shares and pays a hearty 2.4% dividend. The company reported under-consensus earnings last month, but Credit Suisse reiterated its Outperform rating on the stock, citing strong card loan growth and purchase volume in the report. Shares are up about 7% for the year, and InvestingProâs fair value calculations give the stock plenty more upside ahead.Story continuesTenet HealthcareOver at David Einhornâs Greenlight Capital - which was up some 37% last year - the investor has doubled his stake in Tenet Healthcare (NYSE:THC) to $84.8 million, or 4.6% of his portfolio. Tenetâs profitability health is top-notch thanks to the hospital operatorâs cushy margins and returns, and it just recently crushed Q1 earnings and revenue estimates while also ratcheting up guidance for the full year. All of this supports Tenetâs solid 3.12 InvestingPro health score, and the company is also aggressively buying back shares. Brokerages overwhelmingly rate the stock a buy, looking for a more-than-20% share climb. And InvestingPro fair value gives the stock more than 30% upside, even after its 40% surge since the start of the year.Hilton HotelsMeanwhile, activist investor Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Management still maintains his longtime Hilton (NYSE:HLT) stake, having picked up a few more shares for a $1.31 billion investment, or 12.8% of his portfolio. The hotel operator sports a lofty 3.09 InvestingPro financial health score, in large part thanks to its strong showing in profitability and earnings growth. Analyst targets give plenty of room for upside, and Barclays (LON:BARC) just upgraded it to Overweight, calling it a âbest-in-class lodging C-corpâ with âoutstandingâ expansion of its hotel portfolio, or net unit growth. Shares are up nearly 10% year to date.Chipotle Mexican GrillChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is another long-running Bill Ackman investment, and as of Q1 amounted to $1.76 billion, or a whopping 17.2% of his portfolio. The fast-casual restaurateur commands an outstanding 3.37 InvestingPro financial health score, undergirded by fantastic profitability and growth vs. its peers. It also flew past Q1 earnings estimates last month, in response to which Credit Suisse said it continues âto have high conviction in this rare compounding growth story,â while TD Cowen said the stock remains a top 3 pick at the research firm. Shares are up some 50% for the year.Related ArticlesInvestingPro exclusive: Invest like Wall Street Titans With These 5 SparklersProcter &amp; Gamble earns second upgrade this week, JPMorgan raises on EPS upsideUBS upgrades First Solar to Buy on 2023 credit boost]"

The chain plans to swap out its current ice machines for nugget (or, pellet, if you prefer) ice, but you might have to wait a little before you see it at your local store. Yep, thatâs the same kind enthusiasts gush over at Sonic, Chick-Fil-A or, in some cases, hospitals.More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per yearâall while working from home Looking to make extra cash?

Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home The chain says the rollout will take place over the next few years, with locations that have a high number of cold drink orders getting the softer, more compressed ice first.âAs we continue to innovate and make investments in the Starbucks Experience for our partners (baristas) and customers, we are introducing new machines that make nugget ice to select stores this year,â a Starbucks rep told Fortune. âLike many of our recent investments, this machine allows partners to focus on delivering the Starbucks Experience while hand-crafting the same delicious, high-quality iced beverages our customers have come to expect.âWhile loyalists sing songs of praise to the crunchable, chewable ice, there is a contingent of Starbucks customers who are worried the new ice could melt faster in their drinks, watering them down. (Starbucks says it has tested this and found the ice does not melt faster.)Nugget ice has always been popular, but used to be a rare find. Thatâs changing, though. General Electric, eight years ago, introduced its Opal nugget ice maker for home use and the device has been a hot seller ever since, despite its steep price tag, which often exceeds $500.This isnât the first time Starbucks has played with its ice offerings.

Shares have lost about 5.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ADM due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Archer Daniels Q1 Earnings &amp; Revenues Surpass EstimatesArcher Daniels posted impressive first-quarter 2023 results. The top and bottom lines advanced year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results have been bolstered by strong margins across the Ag Services &amp; Oilseeds, and Carbohydrate Solutions segments and a solid product portfolio.Q1 HighlightsArcher Danielsâ adjusted earnings of $2.09 per share in the first quarter outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.71 and our estimate of $1.62. The figure also jumped 10% from $1.90 in the year-ago quarter. On a reported basis, Archer Danielsâ earnings were $2.12 per share, up 14% from the prior-year quarterâs $2.12.Revenues advanced 1.8% year over year to $24,072 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23,480 million and our estimate of $23,617.5 million.Segment-wise, revenues for Ag Services &amp; Oilseeds grew 1.8% year over year, whereas Carbohydrate Solutionsâ revenues rose 5.1% year over year. However, Nutrition witnessed a year-over-year revenue decline of 3.7%.The gross profit increased 9.6% year over year to $2,080 million, while the gross margin expanded 60 basis points (bps) to 8.6% in the quarter under review. SG&amp;A expenses rose 6.3% to $881 million.Archer Daniels reported an adjusted segmental operating profit of $1,725 million in first-quarter 2023, up 11% from the year-ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, ADMâs segmental operating profits grew 11.7% year over year to $1,719 million.Story continuesSegmental Operating ProfitAdjusted operating profit for Ag Services &amp; Oilseeds rose 20% year over year to $1,210 million. This can be attributable to strength across the South America region, driven by excellent risk management and solid export demand due to record Brazilian soybean crop. Then again, stronger soybean exports aided North America origination. The Global Trade performance gained from solid margins and efficient execution.Crushing results remained flat year over year. Strong soybean and softseed crush margins stemming from robust demand for renewable fuels contributed to the results in North America. The performance in the EMEA region was drab year over year due to trade flows adjusted from the dislocations caused last year by the war in Ukraine.Refined Products and Other results have been strong year over year, benefiting from record volumes and strong margins in North America biodiesel, as well as robust demand for food oil and export demand for biodiesel in EMEA. Also, equity earnings from Wilmar were lower than that in the year-earlier quarter.The Carbohydrate Solutions segmentâs adjusted operating profit declined 14% to $273 million. The Starches and Sweeteners sub-segment, including ethanol production from the wet mills, has recorded improved year-over-year results. This mainly resulted from solid volumes and strong margins in the North America region, which partly offset lower ethanol margins.Meanwhile, robust margins aided the EMEA region. The global wheat milling business witnessed higher margins, driven by solid demand.Vantage Corn Processorsâ results have been soft due to higher ethanol inventory levels, which, in turn, dented the margins.In the Nutrition segment, the adjusted operating profit of $145 million fell 23% from $189 million in the year-ago quarter. The Human Nutrition unit was flat year over year. The Flavors unit was drab due to sluggish results in North America, while sturdy margins aided the Specialty Ingredients unit. The Health &amp; Wellness business remained weak year over year.The Animal Nutrition unit was weak year over year due to lower margins in amino acids.Other FinancialsThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $899 million; long-term debt, including current maturities, of $8,697 million; and shareholdersâ equity of $24,896 million. As of Mar 31, 2023, ADM used $1,610 million in cash for operating activities. It repurchased shares worth $351 million and dividends of $248 million in the reported quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -8.42% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, ADM has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a C. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, ADM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Dow Jones U.S. Hotel &amp; Lodging REITs Index is up by more than 5% since the turn of the year, implying the long-felt effects of the Covid-19 pandemic are behind us. Moreover, a U.S. interest rate pivot is on the horizon, likely providing a creditworthy tailwind to cyclical real estate assets such as hotels and resorts.If you share the same outlook on the property market as I do, then here are two hospitality-centric REITs to consider.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with HST. Click here to check it out. HST 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of HSTPeter Lynch Chart of HSTPark Hotels &amp; Resorts2 Hotel REITs to Consider Checking IntoHeadquartered in Tysons, Virginia, Park Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. (NYSE:PK) is a former Hilton-owned company that invests in premium hotels. With more than 33,000 rooms in total, it is one of the largest publically traded REITs and hosts an extensive market position.Apart from its robust market position, a big draw to the company is its most recent uptick in occupancy, which surged by 14.8% year over year as per the end of its second quarter, landing at 65%. Moreover, Park Hotels &amp; Resorts achieved adjusted free cash flow per share of 42 cents in the same quarter, up by 425% from the previous year.The illustrated combination of top-line growth and economic value added is yet to be priced by financial market participants as the asset is trading at a price-to-funds from operations ratio of 5.6, which outranks approximately 84.04% of Park Hotels &amp; Resorts' sector peers.2 Hotel REITs to Consider Checking IntoLastly, a salient feature worth mentioning is the REIT's recent land acquisition. In a deal worth $18 million, Park Hotels &amp; Resorts purchased a property adjacent to the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort. It also illustrates the company's ability to acquire prime real estate while cornering the market and fending off rising competition.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts2 Hotel REITs to Consider Checking IntoHost Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. (NASDAQ:HST) is the largest owner of lodging real estate and owns a variety of luxury hotel properties. The REIT's stock has gained by more than 5% since the turn of the year, which bodes well with its respectable dividend yield of 2.53%.Story continuesThe primary attraction to Host Hotels &amp; Resorts in today's market environment relates to the momentum it receives from industry-related occupancy levels that are only 7% adrift from their pre-pandemic levels. The industry's recovery was recently highlighted by independent research and trading firm Compass Point, which also believes the company provides ""the most liquid way to participate in the urban hotel recovery.""Furthermore, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts' latest financial results conveyed numerous talking points. First, in its third quarter, the REIT produced a 31.1% increase in revenue per available room, resulting in quarterly revenue of $1.38 billion. Over and above that, an Ebitda margin of 32.5% was achieved, suggesting the vehicle is more than capable of passing through multidecade-high inflation to its customers.A deeper look into the REIT's investment thesis illustrates why it is able to tolerate trying macroeconomic times. Host Hotels &amp; Resorts only invests in investment-grade lodges with synergetic opportunities. To expand on the latter, the group invests in properties that it believes integrate with its portfolio's ancillary service providers, such as operators. By phasing synergies into its corporate portfolio, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts is able to cut costs and provide its shareholders with excess returns.Lastly, the prospecting landscape for the REIT looks bright as it is in the middle of a renovation cycle and a management style transition, which it believes will both add to revenue and cut future costs.By and large, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts is an operating powerhouse that provides significant shareholder value.Noteworthy risksBefore considering a position in either of the REITs, it must be considered that hotel assets are tremendously risky. For instance, their prospects are inextricably linked to the economic environment, which is still uncertain. Additionally, hotel properties generate short-term cash flows due to high tenant turnover. Therefore, most stock market participants assign higher risk premiums to them, resulting in lower valuations.Final wordExpected returns on hotel REITs have rarely been brighter as the pandemic has abated, an interest rate cycle shift is en route and intra-industry recoveries have commenced.Among the most lucrative assets within the industry are Park Hotels &amp; Resorts, which has a phenomenal market position with its cunning ability to corner the market. Additionally, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts is in the process of a significant recovery as its revenue per available room is skyrocketing.As a result, both assets are showing signs of value and it is only a matter of time before investors latch onto them.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Those include one in February in which a FedEx plane flew about 100 feet (30 meters) over the top of a Southwest jet in Austin, Texas, after an air traffic controller cleared both planes to use the same runway.In the incident this month, an inbound United Airlines plane flew as low as a few hundred feet (100 meters) over San Francisco Bay before pilots saw the Southwest jet on the same runway and decided to abandon their landing.Shortly after that, the crew of an incoming Alaska Airlines plane saw the same Southwest jet crossing a second, parallel runway, and the pilots aborted their landing too.Both the United and Alaska planes circled around and landed safely.The air traffic controller told the crew of the Southwest jet, âYou shouldnât be on the runway,â according to a recording captured by LiveATC.com. When one of the pilots tried to explain, the controller cut him off, saying, âI don't need an argument.""The incident was first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. The San Francisco airport was the scene of a frightening near-disaster in 2017, when pilots of an Air Canada jet mistook a taxiway for their runway and nearly landed on top of four other planes waiting to take off.Despite recent close calls, the acting head of the FAA has said the nation's air-traffic system is safe, pointing to the lack of a fatal crash involving a U.S. airline since 2009.However, concern about the close calls led the FAA to hold a âsafety summitâ in March. The agency said this week it is investing $100 million in improvements at 12 airports â but not San Francisco â to reduce the number of ârunway incursions,â when a plane or airport vehicle is on a runway when it should not be.]"

86,993b2bf4-98d0-399a-a865-fea88f1e4592,HCA,2023-05-26,Allison Transmission and Alico have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/allison-transmission-alico-highlighted-zacks-125400734.html,1685019240,STORY,"['ALSN', 'ALCO', 'HCA', 'PFE', 'UNH']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL â May 25, 2023 â Zacks Equity Research shares Allison Transmission Holdings ALSN as the Bull of the Day and Alico ALCO as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on UnitedHealth Group UNH, HCA Healthcare HCA and Pfizer PFE.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Allison Transmission Holdings, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is witnessing bullish tailwinds including a set of strategic buyouts and new product launches that bode well for the automotive parts company. The stock is breaking out to the upside and hit an all-time high earlier this year. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to make new highs amid an uncertain economic environment. Shares continue to display relative strength as buying pressure accumulates in this market leader.ALSN sports the highest Zacks Value Style Score of âA,â indicating further upside based on favorable valuation metrics. The company is part of the Zacks Automotive â Original Equipment industry group, which ranks in the top 45% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries.Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stockâs price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Itâs no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.Company DescriptionAllison Transmission Holdings designs, manufactures, and sells commercial and defense automatic transmissions for medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles. The company offers transmissions for various applications including distribution, construction, fire, and emergency on-highway trucks; school and transit buses; energy and mining off-highway vehicles; and wheeled and tracked defense vehicles.Story continuesALSN provides transmissions and electric propulsion solutions under the Allison Transmission brand name, as well as remanufactured transmissions under the ReTran brand name. In addition, the company sells branded replacement parts, support equipment, engineering services, and defense kits. ALSN markets its products to original equipment manufacturers, distributors, and the U.S. government through approximately 1,600 independent distributor and dealer locations.Strategic buyouts such as Walker Die Casting, C&amp;R Tool &amp; Engineering, and Vantage Power are set to boost company prospects. New product launches in China such as the FracTran â a next-generation hydraulic fracturing transmission product â will help buoy sales in the coming quarters.Earnings Trends and Future EstimatesALSN has built up an impressive earnings history, surpassing earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters. Back in April, the company reported first-quarter earnings of $1.85/share, a 21.71% surprise over the $1.52 consensus estimate. ALSN has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 12.84%.The ALSN growth engine is expected to remain hot this year, as analysts covering the automotive parts company have increased their EPS estimates across the board. Full-year estimates have been raised by +9.8% in the past 60 days. The 2023 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $6.61/share, reflecting potential growth of 19.53% relative to the same quarter in the prior year.Letâs Get TechnicalALSN shares have advanced nearly 30% in the past year. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio â one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.Notice how both the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are sloping up. The stock has been making a series of higher highs. With both strong fundamentals and technicals, ALSN is poised to continue its outperformance.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, Allison Transmission Holdings has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and ALSN continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run this year. Despite the impressive performance, ALSN currently trades relatively undervalued at just a 7.31 forward P/E.Bottom LineSolid institutional buying should continue to provide a tailwind for the stock price. ALSN is ranked favorably by our Zacks Style Score Categories, with an âAâ for Value and âBâ for Growth, paving the way for an overall âAâ VGM score. Increasing volume at recent breakout levels is another bullish sign.Robust fundamentals combined with a strong technical trend certainly justify adding shares to the mix. Backed by a leading industry group and robust history of earnings beats, itâs not difficult to see why this company is a compelling investment. Investors would be wise to consider ALSN as a portfolio candidate if they havenât already done so.Bear of the Day:Alico operates as an agribusiness and land management company in the United States. Alico cultivates citrus trees to produce citrus for delivery to the processed and fresh citrus markets. In addition, ALCO is involved in cattle ranching, sugarcane and sod production, and forestry. The company also owns and manages land for leasing, grazing, conservation, and mining activities. Based out of Fort Myers, ALCO owns over 74,000 acres of land in Florida.The Zacks RundownALCO, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a component of the Zacks Agriculture â Operations industry group, which ranks in the bottom 13% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.Candidates in the bottom tiers of industries can often be solid potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in a poor-performing industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.Along with many other agricultural stocks, ALCO experienced a climax top in April of last year and has been in a price downtrend ever since. The share price is hitting a series of lower lows and represents a compelling short opportunity as the market remains volatile.Recent Earnings Misses &amp; Deteriorating OutlookALCO has fallen short of earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters. Earlier in May, the company reported a fiscal Q2 loss of -$1.62/share, missing the $0.13/share consensus EPS estimate by -1,346.15%. Poor performance can be partially explained by decreased revenues due to lessened fruit production, as the company was still dealing with the fallout from Hurricane Ian.Still, over the past four quarters, ALCO has delivered an average earnings miss of -449.78%. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and Alico is no exception.ALCO has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. For the current fiscal year, analysts have decreased estimates by -186.17% in the past 60 days. The 2023 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate is now -$2.69/share, reflecting a -1,180.95% regression relative to fiscal 2022.Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.Technical OutlookALCO is in a sustained downtrend. The stock is making a series of lower lows, with no respite from the selling in sight.While not the most accurate indicator, ALCO has also experienced what is known as a âdeath cross,â wherein the stockâs 50-day moving average (blue line) crosses below its 200-day moving average. ALCO would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. The stock has fallen nearly 40% in the past year alone.Final ThoughtsA deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to produce fresh highs anytime soon. The fact that ALCO is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stockâs downtrend.Our Zacks Style Scores depict a weakening outlook for this stock, as ALCO is rated a worst-possible âFâ in our Value category and âFâ for our overall VGM score. Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of ALCO until the situation shows major signs of improvement.Additional content:Debt Ceiling Crisis Looms: How Will It Impact Medical Stocks?The United States is facing a looming debt-ceiling crisis that could have disastrous consequences for the global economy. The debt ceiling, or debt limit, is the total amount the U.S. government is allowed to borrow to finance its expenditure, such as paying salaries and welfare allowances.On Jan 19, the United States hit its debt ceiling limit of $31.4 trillion, leading to a standoff between the White House and Congress over how to raise or suspend the limit, per a Reuters article. A continued impasse related to the debt-ceiling crisis will impact all sectors. The medical companies may face challenges as government healthcare spending may get reduced or halted without a resolution.Probable Impact of the CrisisU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the country could default on its debt as early as Jun 1, 2023 if the impasse is not resolved. A default would mean that the United States would fail to pay its creditors, such as foreign governments and investors, who hold U.S. Treasury bonds. This could trigger a financial crisis that would have a ripple effect across the world, impacting markets, trade and currencies.A potential default will also have significant implications for the healthcare industry, with the government focusing more on repaying its debt than healthcare-related spending. The default may also impact Social Security and unemployment insurance benefits, leading to lower or delayed medical expenses by patients.Factors Causing High DebtThe debt-ceiling crisis is part of an ongoing political debate within Congress about federal government spending and the national debt that the U.S. government accrues. The United States has had large budget deficits for years, meaning that it spends more than it collects in taxes. In fiscal year 2022, the federal government brought in $4.90 trillion but spent $6.27 trillion, with a net budget deficit of $1.38 trillion (the fourth highest of the 21st century).The main drivers of federal spending are mandatory programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Other expenses of the government comprise discretionary spending, which also includes defense. A portion of the budget is also spent on paying interest on the debt, which is expected to rise further as debt grows.Here we discuss three medical stocks that may be potentially impacted by the crisis going forward:UnitedHealth Group is the largest health insurer in the United States, serving more than 150 million customers through its various plans, including Medicare and Medicaid. A default may result in a potential disruption in UNHâs revenue stream and cash flow. Shares of UnitedHealth Group have declined 9.6% so far this year.HCA Healthcare, the largest for-profit hospital operator in the United States, owns and operates 186 hospitals and 121 freestanding surgery centers across 20 states and the United Kingdom. HCA could get delayed payments from Medicare and Medicaid, which account for about 40% of its net revenues in case of a default. Shares of HCA Healthcare have gained 11.6% so far this year.Pfizer, one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies, produces and sells a wide range of drugs and vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccine. A default may affect PFEâs ability to collect payments from government agencies and programs, such as the Department of Defense and the Veterans Health Administration. Shares of Pfizer have lost 22.6% so far this year.UnitedHealth Group, HCA Healthcare and Pfizer all carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of todayâs Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Debt Ceiling HistoryPer a Reuters article, the United States has raised its debt ceiling 78 times since 1960, usually without much controversy. However, in recent years, some lawmakers have used the debt ceiling as a leverage point to demand spending cuts or policy changes from the opposing party. This resulted in several near-default situations and government shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2019.Current ScenarioIn the current impasse, Republicans have proposed cutting spending back to 2022 levels as a precondition to raising the debt ceiling, while Democrats have insisted on a ""clean bill"" without preconditions, as had been the case in raising the ceiling three times during the Trump administration.President Joe Biden has urged Congress to act swiftly and responsibly to avoid a default that would harm millions of Americans and damage the country's reputation and creditworthiness. He has also ruled out invoking the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which some legal scholars argue gives him the authority to bypass Congress and raise the debt limit unilaterally. Biden has said he does not want to create a constitutional crisis over a fiscal one.As the deadline approaches, both sides are under pressure to reach a compromise or face the consequences of a historic default that could plunge the world into a new recession.Why Havenât You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

(NYSE:GS) Passed Our Checks, And It's About To Pay A US$2.50 Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-group-inc-nyse-104659102.html,1685098019,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is about to go ex-dividend in just 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Goldman Sachs Group's shares before the 31st of May in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 29th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$2.50 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$10.00 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Goldman Sachs Group stock has a trailing yield of around 3.1% on the current share price of $323.88. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see Goldman Sachs Group paying out a modest 33% of its earnings.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. It's encouraging to see Goldman Sachs Group has grown its earnings rapidly, up 28% a year for the past five years.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Goldman Sachs Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 18% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.The Bottom LineIs Goldman Sachs Group an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Typically, companies that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings are keeping the profits for reinvestment in the business. This is one of the most attractive investment combinations under this analysis, as it can create substantial value for investors over the long run. Overall, Goldman Sachs Group looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.In light of that, while Goldman Sachs Group has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock.

88,53453969-1661-30ba-a0ed-b2bb3c8dfb9c,GS,2023-05-26,"Here is What to Know Beyond Why The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-goldman-sachs-130007786.html,1685019607,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[Goldman Sachs (GS) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this investment bank have returned -5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.4% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Goldman belongs, has lost 6.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Goldman is expected to post earnings of $7.89 per share, indicating a change of +2.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $31.83 points to a change of +5.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $36.54 indicates a change of +14.8% from what Goldman is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Goldman.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Goldman, the consensus sales estimate of $12.32 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.8%. The $48.45 billion and $51.76 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.3% and +6.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGoldman reported revenues of $12.22 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.5%. EPS of $8.79 for the same period compares with $10.76 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.03 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -6.16%. The EPS surprise was +7.99%.Over the last four quarters, Goldman surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Goldman is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Goldman. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

89,79be0376-2255-3dd6-8147-7cda20d66307,GPN,2023-05-26,âWeâre Going Upâ: Billionaire Steve Cohen Loads Up on These 2 âStrong Buyâ Stocks â Hereâs Why You Should Follow,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/going-billionaire-steve-cohen-goes-132838229.html,1685021318,STORY,"['AXNX', 'GPN']","[The phrase âa recession is comingâ has attained a mantra-like quality in recent times, reflecting the prevailing belief that a downturn in the economy is imminent.However, taking a stance in opposition to the doom sayers, billionaire Steve Cohen is keeping an optimistic outlook. âIâm making a prognostication â weâre going up,â Cohen said recently. âIâm actually pretty bullish.âThat might be a bold statement to make right now, but itâs not as if Cohen has had no success in taking the fearless route. He has led his Point72 asset management firm and built his fortune â ~$17.5 billion of it â using a high-risk/high-reward strategy. So, evidently, Cohen knows a thing or two about investing.But Cohen has also been doing more than just talking. Putting his words into action, he has been confidently loading up on a pair of stocks recently â splashing out millions on them.We ran these stock picks through the TipRanks database to gauge the Street sentiment toward these names as well. It appears that Cohen receives the analystsâ backing here, as both are rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus. Letâs find out why.Global Payments (GPN)The first Cohen-approved name weâll look at is Global Payments, a leading worldwide provider of payment technology and solutions. With a strong global reach spanning across more than 170 countries, the firm offers a wide range of payment processing services to businesses of all sizes. GPNâs payment solutions allow for seamless transactions across various channels, including in-store, online, and mobile platforms, and the companyâs offerings include payment processing, fraud prevention, analytics, and customer engagement tools.The company surpassed expectations when it delivered results for 1Q23 at the start of the month. Revenue climbed by 6% year-over-year to $2.29 billion, beating the consensus estimate by $280 million. Likewise, on the bottom-line, adj. EPS of $2.40 outpaced the $2.31 anticipated on the Street.Story continuesImportantly, the company raised its outlook, too, increasing its 2023 revenue projection to the range between $8.635 billion to $8.735 billion. This exceeds the consensus estimate of $8.60 billion. Furthermore, adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $10.32 to $10.44 compared to the $10.31 the analysts had in mind.Cohen must have been pleased with the readout. He bought 487,500 shares in Q1, more than doubling his GPN position. He currently holds a total of 951,900 shares, worth over $94.2 million.Despite the quarterly outperformance, the shares fell following the print, and that is most likely due to the company announcing that CEO Jeffrey S. Sloan will be stepping down on June 1.However, that is not really an issue for Raymond James analyst John Davis, who writes: âWhile the timing of the announced CEO transition was surprising and certainly isnât ideal, we have a high degree of confidence in incoming CEO Cameron Bready and donât expect much to change. All told, we believe execution is now back at the forefront, and we continue to see a path for $12+ in FY24 EPS as EVO is integrated ($125M synergy target reiterated) and capital deployment returns (~3.2x leverage by year-end).ââSimply put,â Davis went on to add, âwith the stock trading at just 9x our updated FY24 EPS, despite mid-teens+ normalized EPS growth, we think GPN offers one of the most compelling risk/reward opportunities across our large cap coverage.âQuantifying that stance, Davis rates GPN shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) while his $156 price target implies investors will notch returns of ~58% over the coming year. (To watch Davisâ track record, click here)No fewer than 19 of Wall Streetâs analysts have sounded off on GPN and their reviews break to 15 Buys and 4 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is currently priced at $98.99 and the $139.42 average price target suggests it has room for ~41% growth by the end of next year. (See GPN stock forecast)Axonics Modulation Technologies (AXNX)For our next Cohen-sanctioned name, letâs pivot to a different kind of tech proposition: Axonics. Axonics is a medical technology company specializing in the development and market introduction of solutions for the treatment of various urological and pelvic health conditions.The company offers two main products. The first is the Axonics System, which is a sacral neuromodulation (SNM) therapy. This implantable neurostimulation device is specifically designed to provide long-term relief for patients suffering from overactive bladder (OAB), fecal incontinence, and urinary retention. The second product is Bulkamid, a gel treatment specifically developed for female stress urinary incontinence.These products contributed to a 46% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1, reaching a total of $70.7 million and surpassing the Streetâs forecast of $64.4 million. The earnings per share (EPS) came in at -$0.19, also outpacing the consensus estimate of -$0.29. Furthermore, the company raised its full-year revenue guidance from the previous $342 million to $348 million, representing a 27% increase compared to 2022.That, however, was evidently not good enough for investors, who might have been looking for a bigger increase to the outlook and sent shares down following the resultsâ publication.Yet, Cohen must have seen enough to please him when researching this firm. He opened a new position in Q1 by scooping up 1,070,500 AXNX shares. At the current trading price, these are worth almost $54.8 million.The company also has a fan in Piper Sandler analyst Adam Maeder, who finds the depressed share price appealing.âWe continue to see a favorable set-up for AXNX looking ahead, particularly at these valuation levels,â the 5-star analyst said. âWe believe AXNX continues to operate at a high-level, and we see numbers comfortably set for both Q2 and FY: 2023 with the potential for upside to materialize. With shares currently trading at a discount to other high-growth medtech assets, we see an attractive entry point into the stock, and weâd be buyers on any weakness.âAccordingly, Maeder rates AXNX shares an Overweight (i.e., Buy) while his $84 price target implies the stock will be changing hands for a 64% premium a year from now. (To watch Maederâs track record, click here)Overall, AXNX stock gets the Streetâs full support. All recent reviews â 7, in total â are positive, naturally making the consensus view here a Strong Buy. The forecast calls for one-year gains of ~55%, considering the average target clocks in at $79.29.

90,c19e7615-2285-3361-8f75-107dc8df55ae,SLB,2023-05-26,Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) Is Doing The Right Things To Multiply Its Share Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schlumberger-nyse-slb-doing-things-110118633.html,1685098878,STORY,['SLB'],"[Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) returns on capital, so let's have a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Schlumberger, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) Ã· (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$4.6b Ã· (US$44b - US$12b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Schlumberger has an ROCE of 15%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 9.8% generated by the Energy Services industry. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Schlumberger compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Schlumberger here  for free.The Trend Of ROCESchlumberger has not disappointed in regards to ROCE growth. We found that the returns on capital employed over the last five years have risen by 156%. That's a very favorable trend because this means that the company is earning more per dollar of capital that's being employed. Speaking of capital employed, the company is actually utilizing 43% less than it was five years ago, which can be indicative of a business that's improving its efficiency. A business that's shrinking its asset base like this isn't usually typical of a soon to be multi-bagger company.Story continuesOur Take On Schlumberger's ROCEIn summary, it's great to see that Schlumberger has been able to turn things around and earn higher returns on lower amounts of capital. Astute investors may have an opportunity here because the stock has declined 23% in the last five years. With that in mind, we believe the promising trends warrant this stock for further investigation.If you want to continue researching Schlumberger, you might be interested to know about the 3 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

91,8c60809d-e6d1-3df6-b63a-99360437f1de,PRGO,2023-05-26,Is Perrigo (PRGO) Stock Undervalued Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/perrigo-prgo-stock-undervalued-now-134012727.html,1685022012,STORY,['PRGO'],"[Here at Zacks, our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks. Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.Perrigo (PRGO) is a stock many investors are watching right now. PRGO is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 11.96 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 22.23. PRGO's Forward P/E has been as high as 16.89 and as low as 11.09, with a median of 13.42, all within the past year.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. PRGO has a P/S ratio of 0.98. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.61.Finally, our model also underscores that PRGO has a P/CF ratio of 20.60. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook.

HOLX, Masimo Corp. MASI and Integer Holdings ITGR.Industry: Medical InstrumentsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2099462/3-medical-instruments-stocks-to-buy-amid-industry-challengesThe Medical Instruments industry has witnessed a significant transformation in the nature of business lately, leading to increased investment in R&amp;D for the development of cutting-edge technologies. The healthcare crisis over the past two and a half years has further altered the industry landscape, putting robotic and remote medical services in the limelight.Despite the reopening of the economy, deteriorating international trade, with global inflationary pressure leading to an extremely tough situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, has put the industry in a tight spot again. Further, industry watchers are still unable to gauge the magnitude of economic revival due to the emergence of new COVID strains in selective parts of the world from time to time.The just-reported first-quarter results of a number of medical instrument companies confirmed a gradual rebound in their base businesses. However, the industry-wide trend of staffing shortages and supply chain-related hazards are denting growth. Meanwhile, industry players like Hologic, Inc., Masimo Corp. and Integer Holdings have adapted well to changing consumer preferences and are still witnessing an uptrend in their stock prices.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Medical - Instruments industry is highly fragmented, with participants engaged in research and development (R&amp;D) in therapeutic areas. This FDA-regulated industry comprises an endless number of products, starting from transcatheter valves to orthopedic products to imaging equipment and robotics. Prior to the pandemic, the Medical Instruments space was advancing well in terms of R&amp;D.Story continuesAmong the recent path-breaking inventions, bone growth stimulators, 3D mapping of CT scans, wireless brain sensors and human-brain pacemakers are worth mentioning. During the COVID-hit years, many non-COVID and non-emergency-line innovations were stuck or delayed. However, with the severity of the pandemic easing, the industry players are again more focused on strengthening their pipeline.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Instruments IndustryM&amp;A Trend Continues: The medical instruments space has been benefiting from the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) trend. In fact, various reports suggest that M&amp;A has been the key catalyst in the U.S. MedTech space of late. It is a known fact that smaller and mid-sized industry players attempt to compete with the big shots through consolidation.The big players attempt to enter new markets through a niche product. In 2022, the MedTech space faced a slowdown in terms of M&amp;A compared to the previous years. It only had 11 mega deals. However, markets watchers expect the M&amp;A scenario to rebound in 2023 despite the volatile economic situation.Among the significant deals of recent times, in April 2023, Abbott acquired Cardiovascular Systems at a total expected equity value of approximately $890 million. In February, Globus Medical made a $3.1 billion deal to acquire spine technology company, NuVasive. Medtronic is also divesting and restructuring its divisions for future acquisitions.Business Trend Disruption: Considering the ongoing macroeconomic situation, the IMF came up with its April 2023 World Economic Outlook Update. Per the baseline forecast, growth is expected to decelerate from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023, before settling at 3% in 2024. IMF expects developed economies to see an especially pronounced growth slowdown, from 2.7% in 2022 to 1.3% in 2023.IMF specifically noted that the global headline inflation in the baseline is going to fall from 8.7% in 2022 to 7% in 2023 due to lower commodity prices. However, the underlying (core) inflation is likely to decline more slowly. Inflationâs return to target is unlikely before 2025 in most cases. On a brighter note, strengthening household balance sheets and wage growth are driving private demand.Overall, Medical Instruments industry players are expected to collectively report a year-over-year decline in their revenues due to logistical challenges and increasing unit cost. This might get offset by an increase in essential and non-essential product demand by private households.Digital Revolution: With an increase in the adoption of digital platforms within the medical device space, robotic surgeries, big-data analytics, bioprinting, 3D printing, electronic health records (EHR), predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services are gaining prominence in the United States. A June 2019 Health Care News report suggested that this market, valued at $123 billion in 2018, has been witnessing a CAGR of 25%.Various other reports suggest that companies that adopted AI witnessed a 50% reduction in treatment costs. Telemedicine stocks received an impressive response when, in 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked healthcare service communities to broaden the use of telemedicine.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Medical Instruments industryâs Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates weak near-term prospects.

95,f212dfb3-fae0-3856-a1db-5ff12183f5d5,HOLX,2023-05-26,Here's Why You Should Retain Bruker (BRKR) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-bruker-brkr-152100213.html,1685028060,STORY,"['BRKR', 'HOLX', 'ZBH']","[Bruker Corporation BRKR is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by the strength of its BioSpin Group and CALID businesses. The companyâs recently released 2023 first-quarter results along with raised guidance for the full year, are also encouraging. However, Bruker is not well capitalized in terms of solvency, which is concerning.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has risen 21.2% compared with 4.9% upside of the industry and a 3.3% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $10.73 billion. Bruker projects a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 18.2% compared with 13% of the industry. BRKRâs earnings surpassed estimates in allÂ  the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an average surprise of 10.9%.Letâs delve deeper.UpsidesImpressive Q1 Results: Bruker ended the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The top line reflects a robust performance across all its operating segments and geographies, backed by continued demand for the companyâs differentiated scientific instruments and life-science solutions. The expansion of the gross margin is an upside. The companyâs adjusted operating margin benefited from Project Accelerate 2.0âs high-growth and high-margin initiatives, particularly in proteomics and spatial biology.Meanwhile, the company raised its outlook for 2023 revenues and adjusted EPS. This factors into the quarterâs performance and strength in bookings and backlog, generating investorsâ optimism.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStrong Prospects for BioSpin: It is encouraging to see robust growth in revenues across Brukerâs BioSpin Group portfolio in the first quarter, including NMR and MRI preclinical imaging. Notably, the company received two orders from the United Kingdom for 1.2 gigahertz NMRs. Both will be used for structural and functional biology and life-science research and GreenTech and materials research as well.Story continuesCALID Group Holds Potential: Brukerâs CALID Group revenues increased 16.5% year over year in the first quarter. Organic revenues were supported by strong life science mass spectrometry and vibrational spectroscopy businesses.The timsTOF platform continued its adoption in 4D proteomics, epiproteomics and multiomics. The company had excellent year-over-year growth in bookings and announced further key enhancements to advance capabilities.DownsidesWeak Solvency: Bruker exited the first quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $598 million compared with $646 million at the end of 2022. Â However, the reported quarterâs total debt of $1.23 billion was much higher than the corresponding cash and cash equivalents level. This indicates a tough solvency position.Exposure to Currency Movements: Bruker conducts 80% of its business in international markets. As a result, currency fluctuations continue to result in foreign currency transaction losses at the company. In addition, currency fluctuations could cause the price of Brukerâs products to be less competitive than its principal competitors' offerings.Estimate TrendBruker has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has moved up from $2.55 to $2.58 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the companyâs 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.86 billion. This suggests a 12.8% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Hologic, Inc.

Despite the reopening of the economy, deteriorating international trade, with global inflationary pressure leading to an extremely tough situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, has put the industry in a tight spot again. Further, industry watchers are still unable to gauge the magnitude of economic revival due to the emergence of new COVID strains in selective parts of the world from time to time.The just-reported first-quarter results of a number of medical instrument companies confirmed a gradual rebound in their base businesses. However, the industry-wide trend of staffing shortages and supply chain-related hazards are denting growth. Meanwhile, industry players like Hologic, Inc. HOLX, Masimo Corporation MASI and Integer Holdings ITGR have adapted well to changing consumer preferences and are still witnessing an uptrend in their stock prices.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Medical - Instruments industry is highly fragmented, with participants engaged in research and development (R&amp;D) in therapeutic areas. This FDA-regulated industry comprises an endless number of products, starting from transcatheter valves to orthopedic products to imaging equipment and robotics. Prior to the pandemic, the Medical Instruments space was advancing well in terms of R&amp;D. Among the recent path-breaking inventions, bone growth stimulators, 3D mapping of CT scans, wireless brain sensors and human-brain pacemakers are worth mentioning. During the COVID-hit years, many non-COVID and non-emergency-line innovations were stuck or delayed. However, with the severity of the pandemic easing, the industry players are again more focused on strengthening their pipeline.Story continues3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Instruments IndustryM&amp;A Trend Continues: The medical instruments space has been benefiting from the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) trend. In fact, various reports suggest that M&amp;A has been the key catalyst in the U.S. MedTech space of late. It is a known fact that smaller and mid-sized industry players attempt to compete with the big shots through consolidation. The big players attempt to enter new markets through a niche product. In 2022, the MedTech space faced a slowdown in terms of M&amp;A compared to the previous years. It only had 11 mega deals. However, markets watchers expect the M&amp;A scenario to rebound in 2023 despite the volatile economic situation. Among the significant deals of recent times, in April 2023, Abbott acquired Cardiovascular Systems at a total expected equity value of approximately $890 million. In February, Globus Medical made a $3.1 billion deal to acquire spine technology company, NuVasive. Medtronic is also divesting and restructuring its divisions for future acquisitions.Business Trend Disruption: Considering the ongoing macroeconomic situation, the IMF came up with its April 2023 World Economic Outlook Update. Per the baseline forecast, growth is expected to decelerate from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023, before settling at 3% in 2024. IMF expects developed economies to see an especially pronounced growth slowdown, from 2.7% in 2022 to 1.3% in 2023. IMF specifically noted that the global headline inflation in the baseline is going to fall from 8.7% in 2022 to 7% in 2023 due to lower commodity prices. However, the underlying (core) inflation is likely to decline more slowly. Inflationâs return to target is unlikely before 2025 in most cases. On a brighter note, strengthening household balance sheets and wage growth are driving private demand. Overall, Medical Instruments industry players are expected to collectively report a year-over-year decline in their revenues due to logistical challenges and increasing unit cost. This might get offset by an increase in essential and non-essential product demand by private households.Digital Revolution: With an increase in the adoption of digital platforms within the medical device space, robotic surgeries, big-data analytics, bioprinting, 3D printing, electronic health records (EHR), predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services are gaining prominence in the United States. A June 2019 Health Care News report suggested that this market, valued at $123 billion in 2018, has been witnessing a CAGR of 25%. Various other reports suggest that companies that adopted AI witnessed a 50% reduction in treatment costs. Telemedicine stocks received an impressive response when, in 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked healthcare service communities to broaden the use of telemedicine.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Medical Instruments industryâs Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates weak near-term prospects.

Shares recovered on Wednesday with the stock closing the day up about 2.5%. Shares were down a modest 1% on Thursday.Leon, who has a Strong Buy rating on the stock and a $390 price target, said it's likely investors will see a few choppy quarters ahead but that Netflix should be in a stronger position by Q4 and set itself up ""very well for 2024.""When asked if he's concerned about churn, Leon said, ""You can't really have churn for someone who's not paying a subscription.""In its quarterly shareholder letter last month, Netflix said the company expected short-term churn before users signed up for their own accounts: ""In Canada, which we believe is a reliable predictor for the US, our paid membership base is now larger than prior to the launch of paid sharing and revenue growth has accelerated and is now growing faster than in the U.S.""Netflix's controversial password sharing crackdown hit US users on Tuesday â but analysts remain bullish on the initiative's ability to add incremental revenue growth.

Reflecting on the companyâs history, Co-Founder Marc Randolph recalled a pivotal moment when he attempted to sell Netflix to Blockbuster for $50 million in 2000. Now Netflix is valued at over $150 billion.Donât Miss: Why Jason Calacanis and Other Silicon Valley Elites Are Betting On This Startups Vision For Re-Uniting American FamiliesBlockbuster executives ""laughed us out of the room,"" Randolph said.John Antioco, then Blockbuster's CEO, dismissed the offer, considering Netflix a niche business and downplaying the significance of the dot-com era.In hindsight, Antiocoâs skepticism about the dot-com bubble was justified, as its subsequent burst demonstrated. Given Netflixâs lack of profitability at the time, the proposed amount might have appeared too high.Randolph vividly remembers how Blockbuster executives laughed off their proposal, a stark contrast to the current state of affairs where Blockbuster has dwindled to a single store while Netflix thrives.Looking back, Randolph believes the crucial lesson to be learned from the experience, a lesson Blockbuster learned too late, is the importance of self-disruption. If businesses are unwilling to disrupt themselves, there will always be someone else willing to disrupt them.A similar sentiment emerged at Facebook when it introduced the company's values, stating that if it failed to create the next big thing that could potentially replace Facebook, someone else would.These disruptions are becoming all too common, with even the venture capital industry itself being disrupted by platforms like StartEngine, which allow retail investors to invest in top startups.To stay updated with top startup news and investments, sign up for Benzinga's Startup Investing &amp; Equity Crowdfunding NewsletterClayton Christensen, renowned author of âThe Innovatorâs Dilemma,â regarded Netflix as a prime example of disruptive innovation. In 2015, Christensen wrote that Blockbusterâs decision to ignore Netflix might have been justified initially, as the two companies catered to different customer groups. Netflixâs DVD-by-mail service appealed to specific customer segments like movie buffs, early adopters of DVD players and online shoppers.Story continuesAs new technologies allowed Netflix to transition to streaming video over the internet, the company became appealing to Blockbusterâs core customers. Netflixâs disruptive path from the fringes to the mainstream eroded Blockbusterâs market share and profitability.Randolph expressed pride in ignoring the naysayers who believed the idea would never work. Although Netflix is retiring its DVD-by-mail service, which initially propelled its success and contributed to Blockbusterâs downfall, the company has shifted its focus to streaming media directly to consumers. Netflix remains steadfast in its commitment to delivering the utmost service to its members, constantly adapting to the ever-changing industry.See more on startup investing from Benzinga.Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos And Retail Investors All Have One Thing In Common: Theyâre Investing Millions In Brain Technology StartupsKevin OâLeary Is Making It Easier Than Ever To Become A Venture Capitalist With Just $100Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

DLTR has reported first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while sales beat. Moreover, the top line improved year over year, while earnings declined. The top line has benefited from the continued demand for the companyâs products. This was offset by an unfavorable product mix, driven by the demand shift toward low-margin consumable goods, which hurt the bottom line.Despite the strong sales trends across both banners, the company expects the increased demand for consumables and inflationary costs to affect margins and the bottom line in the near term.Shares of DLTR declined 12.1% in the pre-market trading session on May 25.

The bottom-line decline can be attributed to the external pressures affecting all of retail, mainly the margin impact of elevated shrink and the product mix shift to consumables.Consolidated net sales advanced 6.1% year over year to $7,323.8 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,274 million. Enterprise same-store sales (comps) improved 4.8% year over year.

Our model predicted comps growth of 2.5% for the Dollar Tree banner and 6% for Family Dollar.Comps at both segments benefited from a mid-single-digit percent increase in comp traffic. The Dollar Tree segment benefited from a 5.5% increase in average ticket, partly negated by a 2.1% decline in traffic. Comps at Family Dollar were aided by a 4.3% increase in traffic and a 2.2% rise in average ticket.Story continuesDollar Tree, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseÂ Dollar Tree, Inc.

The gross margin contracted 530 bps to 35.3% at the Dollar Tree banner and 100 bps to 24.8% at the Family Dollar segment.Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 150 bps to 24.8%. SG&amp;A expenses included a $30-million charge related to its legal reserve for the Family Dollar distribution facility in Arkansas. Excluding this charge, the SG&amp;A expense rate was 24.4% in the quarter. The increase mainly reflected higher store and field payroll costs, elevated expenditures for repairs and maintenance to improve store standards, and professional fees. This was partially offset by comparable store net sales leverage.While the operating income declined 42.6% to $419.7 million, the operating margin declined 490 bps to 5.7%. Adjusted operating income declined 38.5% year over year to $449.7 million. Segment-wise, the operating margin declined 660 bps to 13.6% for Dollar Tree.

All major indices experienced significant declines, leaving investors shocked. Itâs inevitable that every investor will experience a market crash during their lifetimes. Accordingly, with a potential market meltdown on the horizon, many investors are wondering what are the best stocks to buy.Focusing on companies that can perform well in any market environment is a go-to strategy for many right now. For those searching for defensive stocks, narrowing down oneâs list to the best high-quality blue-chip stocks is a great way to go.Here are three such companies I think are relatively immune to a potential upcoming calamity. Letâs dive into these safe stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPepsiCo (PEP)PepsiCo building in Russia. PEP stock.Source: 8ED8 / ShutterstockLooking for a stock with growth potential? Consider PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP), a well-known name among investors. Despite the volatile market, the company has reached all-time high levels, attracting investors with reliable earnings and steady cash flow.PepsiCo is a major global food and beverage corporation based in Purchase, New York. The company offers a diverse range of products and brands such as Frito-Lay snacks, Pepsi-Cola beverages, Gatorade sports drinks, Tropicana juices and Quaker foods. PepsiCo operates in over 200 countries and territories, serving millions of customers worldwide.Their organic sales surged 14% in Q1 2023 driven by strong consumer spending on snacks and beverages. The company expanded its revenue by $16 billion in the past two years, up 23%.Consider adding PepsiCo to your portfolio for stability, income and potential sales growth. Itâs a consumer staples giant that should be on your radar for 2023.Newmont Corporation (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockStory continuesDespite the debate on the state of the economy, gold had a successful year, even with the Fedâs monetary tightening program in place. This should have been deflationary for gold, but it performed well, making Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) an interesting option for stocks resistant to inflation.NEM has a strong case for being an inflation-resistant stock due to its copper business, which is constantly in demand. Although its financials could use some improvement, analysts still consider it a strong buy with an average price target of $58.92, indicating a 21% upside potential.Newmont has impressive high-quality assets with 96 million ounces of reserves, ensuring stable production in the years ahead. Their plan to reduce all-in-sustaining-cost over the next three years will also lead to EBITDA margin expansion, even if gold prices remain steady. With a stable investment-grade balance sheet, Newmont is positioned to create sustained shareholder value.McDonaldâs (MCD)McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.Source: Tama2u / ShutterstockMcDonaldâs (NYSE:MCD) is a popular fast-food chain that really requires no introduction. The companyâs success is largely due to the trade-down effect, where even during tough economic times, many households still seek to eat out. McDonaldâs offers affordable food options without compromising quality, making it a compelling choice for many consumers.Investing in McDonaldâs is not only justified by its impressive past performance but also by its current success in passing on higher prices to consumers who remain willing to pay. This is in part due to operational improvements that have boosted efficiency and accuracy. Despite economic headwinds, the American consumer has continued to spend, suggesting that McDonaldâs is poised for further growth. While the stock is near all-time highs, the focus on efficiency bodes well for continued gains.McDonaldâs financial performance is solid but not outstanding overall. Its revenue growth rate over the past three years is 3.8%, outpacing most of the restaurant industry. Additionally, it is consistently profitable, making it a good choice for dividend investors. Its net margin for the trailing year is 29.36%, which is higher than most sector players.To sum up, McDonaldâs Corporation has significant potential for growth, as it expands beyond its current market. It is expected to maintain its position as an industry leader through solid financial strategies and high growth potential. Investing in McDonaldâs stock can provide stability to portfolios and exposure to a globally recognized brand.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Â The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.comÂ Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonaldâs love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

116,11e26d9a-384a-38d9-91c6-00b74d9389f4,M,2023-05-26,Macy's (M) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q1 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macys-m-expected-beat-earnings-140008395.html,1685023208,STORY,['M'],"[The market expects Macy's (M) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on June 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis department store operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.46 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -57.4%.Revenues are expected to be $5.11 billion, down 4.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.92% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Macy's?For Macy's, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.81%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Macy's will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Macy's would post earnings of $1.57 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.88, delivering a surprise of +19.75%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Macy's appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for General Dynamics Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.60bUS$4.10bUS$4.29bUS$4.57bUS$4.72bUS$4.85bUS$4.97bUS$5.09bUS$5.21bUS$5.33bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x2Est @ 2.74%Est @ 2.55%Est @ 2.42%Est @ 2.33%Est @ 2.26% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$3.4kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.3kUS$3.2kUS$3.0kUS$2.9kUS$2.8kUS$2.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$32bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 Ã (1 + g) Ã· (r â g) = US$5.3bÃ (1 + 2.1%) Ã· (7.3%â 2.1%) = US$105bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$105bÃ· ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$52bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$84b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$204, the company appears quite undervalued at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at General Dynamics as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.870. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for General DynamicsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace &amp; Defense market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.Significant insider buying over the past 3 months.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

In this context, the demand for submarines can be expected to increase manifold as part of initiative to improve undersea warfare competencies.This stands to benefit Huntington Ingalls as its NNS segment is proactively into designing and constructing nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines and is one of the two companies in the United States capable of constructing nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy.Buoyed by such supremacy and with submarines becoming a more significant part of defense landscape, the company witnessed a substantial rise in demand for submarines and subsequently a consistent rise in revenues of NNS segment in the last few quarters. Notably, NNS recorded a rise of 8.3% in revenues in the most recent quarter.NNS is accountable for constructing and delivering six module sections per submarine under contract to General Dynamics Electric Boat. General Dynamicsâ Virginia-class submarine currently has 17 submarines in its backlog, scheduled for delivery through 2032.Considering the importance and demand for the submarine in the days ahead, HII is well-poised to win several significant awards involving the next-generation submarine, like the latest one. This should substantially benefit the company and boost its revenue generation prospects from the NSS business unit.Growth ProspectsPer the report from Mordor Intelligence, the global submarine market is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% over the 2023-2028 period. Hence, the demand for submarines may gain traction and benefit companies like General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls, which remain the two major contractors for submarine manufacturing.Story continuesProminent defense majors that are likely to enjoy the benefits of the expanding submarine market are Northrop GrummanNOC and BAE Systems plc BAESY.Northropâs seabed-to-space advanced multi-domain maritime capabilities enable current and future maritime missions. The company has systems and sensors fielded on Virginia-class submarines, while its WSN-7 is an inertial navigator that allows for precise navigation and aiming of weapons in ships and submarines to operate in areas where GPS is denied.Northropâs long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is pegged at 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOCâs 2023 earnings has been revised upwards by 2.1% in the past 60 days.BAE Systemsâ Astute class is the largest and most advanced attack submarine for the Royal Navy. Equipped with world-leading sensors, the Astute class carries both Tomahawk Land Attack Cruise Missiles and Spearfish heavyweight torpedoes.BAE Systems boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAESYâs 2023 earnings has been revised upwards by 3.6% in the past 60 days.Price MovementIn the past month, shares of Huntington Ingalls have increased 1.1% against the industryâs fall of 1.8%.Zacks RankHuntington Ingalls currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of todayâs Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The new projection represents an increase of 140,000 b/d in 2030 from the previous outlook.""Higher oil prices have driven record returns for the Canadian oil sands,"" said Celina Hwang, Director, North American Crude Oil Markets, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. ""Although producers continue to demonstrate capital discipline, stronger balance sheets are now giving oil sands companies renewed confidence in regard to their intentions for capital spending.""The main driver of the upward revision has been the identification of additional opportunities to improve efficiency and/or optimize output, the analysis says. The ongoing ramp-up and operational efficiency gains from learning by doing and step-out optimization projects are the most significant contributors.Step-out optimizations are a relatively new phenomenon and include, as the name suggests, stepping out from existing operational areas into new high quality adjacent lands.Capital expenditures for oil sands production in 2022 reached their highest levels since 2015 and could rise further this year. However, most of that increase occurred to offset increased inflation and there has not been a resurgence in large-scale greenfield or even brownfield oil sands projects, the analysis says.""The Canadian oil sands have entered an 'era of optimization',"" said Kevin Birn, Vice President, Canadian Oil Markets Chief Analyst, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. ""Learning by doing and step-out optimizations account for nearly 90% of our overall production outlook. The remainder of additions are expected to come from yet another form of optimizationâdebottlenecking projects. Optimizations now dominate the S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights oil sands production growth outlook.""Story continuesS&amp;P Global Commodity Insights expects Canada to continue to post record crude oil production (both oil sands and non-oil sands crude) and export levels annually for the remainder of this decade. A deceleration in growth is expected to begin around the mid to late 2020s, but a very shallow decline only begins to emerge in the early 2030s. The reasons that the decline is expected to be particularly shallow is due to the long, flat production profile of Canadian oil sands assets.Continued upside potential exists for the production outlook given the organic nature of how optimization projects emerge, the analysis says. Policy remains the most likely source of downside risk. In particular, the advancing federal oil and gas cap which intends to establish an absolute oil sands emissions target could temper investment if the targets prove too stringent and unattainable in the time provided, the analysis says.""When oil prices were last at the levels experienced in 2022, the oil sands experienced a surge in development,"" Birn said. ""Today, with over 3.2 million barrels per day of output, the optimization of that large existing base of assets can lead to material additionsâall while maintaining capital discipline sought from upstream oil and gas investors.""Media Contacts: Jeff Marn +1-202-463-8213, Jeff.marn@spglobal.comGlobal/EMEA:Â Paul Sandell + 44 (0)7816 180039, paul.sandell@spglobal.comÂ Americas:Â Kathleen TanzyÂ + 1 917-331-4607,Â kathleen.tanzy@spglobal.comAsia:Â Melissa Tan +Â 65-6597-6241,Â melissa.tan@spglobal.comAbout S&amp;P Global Commodity InsightsAt S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, our complete view of global energy and commodity markets enables our customers to make decisions with conviction and create long-term, sustainable value.We're a trusted connector that brings together thought leaders, market participants, governments, and regulators and we create solutions that lead to progress.

(NYSE:MA) is a blue-chip stock that many investors like as the company due to its dominant position in the global payments network. Economies of scale and built-in inflation protection have done wonders for the comapny's long-term growth. The first quarter 2023 earnings report was another strong one, with key metrics showing growth in the payments network.Mastercard: A Strong Business at a Too-High PriceMA Data by GuruFocusWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MA. Click here to check it out. MA 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MAPeter Lynch Chart of MAHowever, there are two major details that make be believe the stock is not attractive at this time: namely, the valuation is very rich and there is a lot of debt to consider.First-quarter 2023 earnings reviewIn the first quarter of 2023, Mastercard reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.80, beating estimates by $0.09. GAAP EPS was $2.47, a miss of $0.24 compared to estimates, and revenue of $5.75 billion beat expectations by $109.24 million.The company showed momentum and a solid business model as measured by four key metrics related to the payment network. Year-over-year domestic assessments increased by 7%, cross-border assessments increased by 33%, transaction processing assessments grew by 12% and other network assessments increased by 26%.Key advantages of digital payments Mastercard continues to benefit from the global transition from cash-based transactions to digital payments.Digital payments provide a high level of convenience for both consumers and businesses. With just a few taps on a smartphone or clicks on a computer, payments can be made instantly, anytime and anywhere. There's no need to carry cash or visit physical stores or banks. Digital payment systems have improved financial inclusion by enabling individuals without access to traditional banking services to participate in the economy. Mobile wallets and digital payment platforms have made it easier for people to send and receive money, even in remote areas. Digital payments offer enhanced security compared to carrying cash. Encryption, authentication methods and tokenization protect sensitive financial information and minimize the risk of theft or fraud. Additionally, digital transactions leave a digital trail, which can help resolve any disputes.Story continuesDigital payments can be more cost-effective for both consumers and businesses. Cash handling, storage and transportation costs are eliminated, and there is no need for fully digital businesses to invest in cash registers or secure cash management systems. Some digital payment methods also offer lower transaction fees compared to traditional payment methods, even if it may not seem like it at first glance. Digital payments are significantly faster than traditional payment methods. Transactions can be completed within seconds, allowing for quicker and more efficient checkout processes, thus increasing the likelihood of a sale.Digital payments also generate electronic records, providing easy access to transaction history for consumers and businesses. This facilitates budgeting, expense tracking and financial planning. For businesses, analyzing payment data can provide insights into customer behavior and preferences, enabling them to make more informed decisions. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, digital payments gained popularity due to their contactless nature. Contactless payment methods, such as mobile wallets or NFC-enabled cards, minimize physical contact between individuals, reducing the potential spread of germs.Furthermore, digital payment systems can integrate with other financial services, such as budgeting tools, loyalty programs and financial management apps. This integration simplifies financial management for individuals and offers additional benefits and rewards for users.Mastercard is one of the top players in global digital paymentsAs one of the first-movers, Mastercard has been able to build very strong brand recognition that is incredibly difficult for newer players to emulate. Mastercard has established a vast network of merchants and financial institutions worldwide. Its cards are widely accepted in numerous countries, making it convenient for consumers to use Mastercard for transactions both domestically and internationally. The company has formed strategic partnerships with a wide range of financial institutions, including banks, credit unions and payment processors. These partnerships facilitate the issuance of Mastercard-branded cards, further expanding the reach and acceptance of Mastercard in the market.Mastercard has consistently invested in technological advancements to enhance its payment infrastructure. It has developed robust payment processing systems, security measures and innovative payment solutions. By staying at the forefront of technological innovation, Mastercard has maintained its competitiveness and relevance in the payments industry.Mastercard prioritizes security in its payment network. It has implemented various security features, such as tokenization, encryption and fraud detection systems, to protect cardholder data and prevent unauthorized transactions. This emphasis on security has helped build trust among consumers and businesses, further solidifying Mastercard's position in the market.Consumer benefits are vital to marketing success, as Mastercard offers various benefits to both merchants and consumers. Merchants benefit from streamlined payment processing, reliable transaction settlement and access to Mastercard's extensive customer base. Consumers enjoy features such as reward programs, cashback offers and secure payment experiences, incentivizing the use of Mastercard for transactions.Mastercard consistently seeks to innovate and diversify its offerings. It has expanded beyond traditional credit and debit cards to include prepaid cards, mobile payments and contactless payments. By embracing emerging payment technologies and exploring new market segments, Mastercard stays ahead of the curve and sustains its dominant position.Now for the bad newsMastercard may have been one of the premier stocks to own historically, but that may have changed in my opinion due to high debt and an overly rich valuation.For the three months ending March 31, the debt-to-equity ratio was 2.84. The company has been growing its long-term debt since 2014, and as a result, the debt has weighed more and more on the company.Mastercard: A Strong Business at a Too-High PriceNext, the valuation is too high on a relative basis. The forward enterprise-value-to-Ebitda ratio for Mastercard is 24.52 versus the sector median of 10.96, while its forward price-sales ratio is 13.87 versus a sector median of 2.08. Forward estimates are based on my own personal projections.Undoubtedly, Mastercard has bright business prospects, but I just can't see the shares as attractive at this time.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

132,6dfeebf9-0a47-3670-8ab6-283ac9ac53f7,QCOM,2023-05-26,5G Foundational Inventions: A Deeper Dive Into the 5G Tree,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5g-foundational-inventions-deeper-dive-141000506.html,1685023800,STORY,['QCOM'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / May 25, 2023 / QualcommQualcomm, Thursday, May 25, 2023, Press release pictureLast time, I wrote about why Qualcomm is the world's leader in 5G technology innovation using the metaphor of a tree. I explained how different technologies in cellular have different roles and levels of importance, similar to the different parts of a tree. Some are fundamental ideas that make cellular communications work at a basic level, holding the entire system up like the trunk of a tree. Others are like branches that help cellular technology extend into different applications and end-use cases. And others are focused improvements and optimizations that resemble a tree's leaves - small and plentiful, but individually less important than the trunk and branches. Qualcomm is the world's leader in cellular technology research and development (R&amp;D) and invention because we focus on the trunk and branches of the tree: the most foundational ideas, concepts, and breakthrough technologies that make cellular communications work.This time, I want to take a deeper dive into a few key examples of these foundational inventions that illustrate our sustained leadership in cellular technology: one that is new and foundational to 5G, one that was born in LTE and has evolved in 5G, and one that is expanding 5G to cutting-edge new verticals.Example #1: Advanced Channel Coding - Efficiently Transmitting DataIn wireless communications, you can't just send raw data over the airwaves and expect it to reach the user just as you sent it. A wireless signal can fade over distance, be blocked, or get muddled due to interference or noise - meaning some data can be lost in the transmission. To overcome this, additional information is added to the data as it gets sent over the airwaves to help it recover lost bits. This is known as ""channel coding"": adding extra information to a transmission to ensure that the receiver can detect and correct errors, resulting in all the data being fully received by the user. The faster data is generated and transmitted, the faster that extra information needs to be added in, and the more power is consumed for coding and decoding. With 5G's ultra-high data rates, it was clear that 4G's existing coding scheme - called ""turbo coding"" - wasn't going to cut it.Story continuesAnticipating this fundamental need, Qualcomm started working on advanced Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) channel coding techniques more than a decade prior to 5G. In the most general sense, LDPC codes have been around for decades since their initial invention in the 1960s. For 5G, our ground-up design marries LDPC with Hybrid ARQ (""automatic repeat query"", a fundamental piece of how cellular communication works) - enabling scaling to tens of Gbps data rates while simultaneously minimizing power consumption.We promoted, demonstrated, and drove this idea in 3GPP, the collaborative global organization that defines the official 5G standard. Multiple contending options existed for a new data channel coding scheme in 5G, but in the end, our LDPC design was chosen as the best option. Every single bit of data in 5G uses Qualcomm's advanced LDPC innovations, enabling 5G's ultra-high data rates while limiting power consumption - and therefore keeping battery sizes down.Example #2: Unlicensed Spectrum -Expanding Cellular ""Real Estate""Spectrum is a very scarce natural resource - the ""real estate"" of wireless communications. Controlled by government regulators, different spectrum bands are traditionally auctioned and licensed to individual operators to use as the basis for their different networks. In one recent US auction, a narrow slice of spectrum in the 3 GHz space raised over $80B.Some spectrum, however, is usually kept unlicensed - i.e. unassigned to any operator - to use for other applications like Wi-Fi networks. This unlicensed spectrum was traditionally considered unusable for cellular networks, but years ago Qualcomm began to explore the idea of using this unlicensed spectrum to meet the growing bandwidth demands of LTE, while still sharing the spectrum responsibly with Wi-Fi usage. Our research began more than five years before we introduced the idea in LTE in December of 2013. We led the vision, research, education, standardization, and commercial efforts, working against skeptical reactions from a number of companies in the ecosystem. But little by little, we successfully illustrated that the idea not only worked, but was a significant improvement to LTE.Thanks to Qualcomm Technologies' R&amp;D vision and leadership, the technology was proven successful and standardized in LTE's Release 13 under the term ""License-Assisted Access"" (LAA). LAA is a backbone of Gigabit LTE, unlocking new capabilities in capacity, speed, and deployments. These days, LAA is used in numerous devices, including many popular Android phones and all current iPhone models.Since then, we have continued to improve and evolve the use of unlicensed spectrum in 5G, called ""NR-U"". Qualcomm's inventions in 5G NR-U help alleviate spectrum constraints, boost deployments and speeds, and enable unlicensed spectrum-based private 5G networks that can form the backbone of industrial Internet of Things (IoT) deployments.Example #3: Satellite Communications - Expanding 5G to New HeightsSatellite communication networks have been around for decades but have traditionally used proprietary technology and specialized equipment. This resulted in limited scale and expensive offerings, keeping satellite communications out of reach for mass-market usage scenarios.Qualcomm has a long history in satellite communications, beginning in the early 1990s. In the 5G era, the satellite community was attracted by the vibrant 5G ecosystem and started some related projects in 3GPP - initially with public safety applications, fixed wireless access, and narrow-band IoT connections as early goals. At Qualcomm, we realized the potential for smartphones to fully utilize satellite communications as a core feature in 5G - well ahead of recent interest in the area. We drove a pivot of this project into smartphones: the biggest opportunity, but also the most complex due to the small form factor precluding the use of large antennas. Qualcomm Technologies has led the R&amp;D of satellite communications capabilities in 3GPP's recent 5G Release 17 and continues to drive satellite communications technology in 5G Advanced for both end user devices and IoT.Bringing 5G satellite communications (also known as ""non-terrestrial networks"", or NTNs) to smartphones and IoT platforms will enable truly complete global coverage, expanding from SMS emergency texting capabilities like the recently-announced Snapdragon Satellite to delivering true mobile broadband over satellites. This extension of 5G has the potential to connect extreme geographies and remote areas, support networks of remote IoT devices, and serve as a back-up in the event of major terrestrial outages such as natural disasters.Continuous InventionCellular technology is now a vital aspect of our lives, economies, and societies. Qualcomm's world-leading R&amp;D, testing, innovation, standards leadership, and commercialization efforts have driven the growth of cellular technologies for over three decades, from the early days of 2G and 3G, to the expansion of mobile broadband capabilities in 4G, to the blazing speeds and connected intelligent edge of 5G, and now to 5G Advanced and beyond. Our ideas built the trunk and branches of the cellular tree that the whole system is based on, making Qualcomm the indispensable R&amp;D leader in cellular technology.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 75% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$115b last week after a 3.7% drop in the share price. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 22% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. Hence, if weakness in QUALCOMM's share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about QUALCOMM. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About QUALCOMM?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.QUALCOMM already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of QUALCOMM, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in QUALCOMM. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.9% of shares outstanding. With 7.5% and 4.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of QUALCOMMThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that QUALCOMM Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$139m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 25% stake in QUALCOMM. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that  QUALCOMM is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Ultimately the future is most important.

134,227af149-cd70-47f6-a3fe-dace0c395485,QCOM,2023-05-26,Nvidia stock explodes after 'guidance for the ages': What Wall Street is saying,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-explodes-after-guidance-for-the-ages-what-wall-street-is-saying-120105455.html,1685016065,STORY,"['NVDA', 'INTC', 'AAPL', 'AMD', 'QCOM']","[Nvidia (NVDA) has cemented its status once more as Wall Street's market darling after an upbeat AI-fueled earnings call and an outlook that rocked the financial models of already bullish analysts.Shares of the chip giant exploded 27% in trading on Thursday as results trounced analyst estimates. The company's ticker page was the most active on the Yahoo Finance platform, followed closely by rival chip players such as AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC).If the gains in Nvidia hold, the companyâs market value would rise more than $200 billion, which would mark the biggest one-day rise in history. Apple's $191 billion pop in November 2022 is the current record holder.It was Nvidia's outlook that truly surprised the investing masses.The company expects second-quarter revenue to come in at about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was anticipating $7.2 billion.Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang told analysts on the conference call the very upbeat outlook reflects a fundamental shift to accelerated computing. In turn, that places Nvidia's chips that power generative AI in high demand.""We're seeing incredible orders to retool the world's data centers. And so I think you're seeing the beginning of, call it, a 10-year transition to basically recycle or reclaim the world's data centers and build it out as accelerated computing,"" Huang said. ""You'll have a pretty dramatic shift in the spend of a data center from traditional computing and to accelerate computing with SmartNICs, smart switches, of course GPUs and the workload is going to be predominantly generative AI.""Here's the vibe on Wall Street after Nvidia's big quarter and outlook.Ruben Roy, Stifel (Hold rating; $370 price target, up from $300): ""Nvidia's recent momentum continued as first quarter results beat consensus expectations and the company's second quarter revenue outlook was significantly above high expectations. Nvidia remains in the sweet spot of AI-infrastructure wallet share as build outs of accelerated computing networks continue. As the company's data center numbers grow, questions on the near-term supply environment are likely to continue. For now, while not providing explicit longer-term guidance, Nvidia management noted that data center-related demand visibility has increased and that the company has procured substantially higher supply for the second half of the year. We raise our estimates and target price and continue to view Nvidia as the best positioned near-term beneficiary of CSP capex spending trends.""Story continuesNvidia Corp CEO Jensen Huang holds one of the company's new RTX 4090 chips for computer gaming in this undated handout photo provided September 20, 2022. Courtesy of Nvidia Corp/Handout via REUTERS (Handout . / reuters)Tristan Gerra, Baird (Outperform rating, upgrade from Hold; $475 price target, up from $300): ""We raised our estimates above consensus and added a Fresh Pick designation to Nvidia on March 20 reflecting our channel feedback about strong H100 orders notably related to ChatGPT emerging in March but we failed to upgrade at that time. As AI-related order momentum continues into the second half, annualized earnings of $10 are at reach within 2-3 quarters in our view, reflected in the valuation post earnings. Our raised next two-year EPS forecast assumes continued AI-related momentum driven by two secular growth trends: continued adoption rate for parallel processing-based acceleration in data centers, and the emergence of AI models notably related to ChatGPT and LLMs [large language models], all of which require GPUs.""Atif Malik, Citi (Buy rating; $420 price target, up from $353): ""While we had raised our target price and estimates into the earnings, Generative AI upside was bigger than we expected. Nvidia expects data center sales to roughly double in the July quarter driven by Gen AI demand from CSPs, consumer internet companies, and accelerated computing in enterprises. Nvidia estimates only ~4% of the $1 trillion data center CPU installed base over the last four years has been GPU accelerated, implying AI adoption remains in early innings.""Dan Ives, Wedbush (no rating/price target): ""There is not one better indicator around underlying AI demand going on in the hyperscale/cloud and overall enterprise market than the foundational Nvidia story. We view Nvidia at the core hearts and lungs of the AI revolution given its core chips train and deploy generative AI applications like ChatGPT. The Street was all awaiting last night's Nvidia quarter and guidance to gauge the magnitude of this AI demand story with many skeptics saying an AI bubble was forming and instead Jensen &amp; Co. delivered guidance for the ages.""Ross Seymore, Deutsche Bank (Hold rating; $390 price target, up from $170): ""After such a massive beat/raise/share price pop, the key question going forward is sustainability. We believe the drivers of it appear to be much more secular than cyclical (AI, DC accelerators crowding out CPUs, etc.), and Nvidia's lead in this market remains sizable, but we remain uncertain as to the pace of such growth post second quarter and if/when the next DC digestion period may occur. Consequently, we are raising our 2024 revenue/EPS by a significant +37%/+70%, with our price target rising to $390 (based upon a consistent 40x P/E multiple). With Nvidia's unique AI market leadership and the scarcity of alternative plays, we see little that could diminish investor optimism and recommend continuing to enjoy the ride.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including AbbVie Inc., Intel Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of todayâs research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of AbbVie have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-2.6% vs. +9.8%). There are concerns about long-term sales growth as Humira generics have entered the U.S. market. Increasing competition from newer therapies is hurting Imbruvicaâs sales. Slowing consumer demand due to economic pressure is hurting the aesthetics franchiseâs sales.Nonetheless, though revenues are expected to decline in 2023, AbbVie expects to return to robust sales growth in 2025. AbbVie has several new drugs in its portfolio with the potential to drive the top line to make up for lost Humira revenues.Skyrizi and Rinvoq have established outstanding launch trajectories bolstered by approval in new indications. The company has several early/mid-stage candidates that have blockbuster potential.(You can read the full research report on AbbVie here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Intelâs shares have gained +2.2% over the past six months against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industryâs gain of +49.3%. The company is witnessing healthy momentum in its data center business with integrated affordable solutions. Heavy investment in research and development to drive technological innovation and concerted focus on increasing market diversification are tailwinds.Intel is increasingly focusing on a diversified product range targeting different segments of the market. Healthy traction from Mobileyeâs technologies related to in-car networking, sensor-chips, cloud software, machine learning and data management are positives.However, an uncertain macroeconomic environment, PC inventory correction, contraction in the server market and high debt burden are affecting its margins. A highly competitive market and manufacturing delays are hurting Intelâs profitability. Signs of market saturation, foreign exchange headwinds and geopolitical instability are worrisome.(You can read the full research report on Intel here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Qualcomm have underperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past six months (-15.1% vs. +12.9%). The companyâs global presence exposes it to risk of trade disputes and geopolitical tensions. High dependence on the smartphone industry is a headwind as weak consumer demand trends can significantly affect margins. Macroeconomic uncertainty and competition from other low-cost chip manufacturers remain other concerns.Nevertheless, Qualcomm is well-positioned to benefit from solid 5G traction with greater visibility and a diversified revenue stream. The EDGE networking business is witnessing steady progress as it focuses on transitioning from a wireless communications firm for the mobile industry to a connected processor company for the intelligent edge.It is likely to help users experience a seamless transition to super-fast 5G networks, delivering low-power resilient multi-gigabit connectivity with unprecedented range and best-in-class security.(You can read the full research report on QUALCOMM here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and CME Group Inc.Story continuesWhy Havenât You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) Ã· Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Lockheed Martin is:59% = US$5.7b Ã· US$9.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.59.Does Lockheed Martin Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Lockheed Martin has a superior ROE than the average (13%) in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Lockheed Martin visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining Lockheed Martin's Debt And Its 59% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Lockheed Martin, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.62. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

It did not elaborate.Chiu said they were concerned about the delay but that communication with the United States on the issue was ""smooth"".Taiwan has been converting 141 F-16A/B jets into the F-16V type and has in addition ordered 66 new F-16Vs, which have advanced avionics, weapons and radar systems to better face down the Chinese air force, including its J-20 stealth fighter.Taiwan has since last year complained of delays to U.S. weapons deliveries, such as Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, as manufacturers turn supplies to Ukraine as it battles invading Russian forces, and the issue has concerned U.S. lawmakers.Congressman Michael McCaul, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said during a visit to Taipei last month that he was doing everything possible to speed up arms deliveries.

140,13560c96-83a4-3d24-bf77-c2451e72aefb,PHM,2023-05-26,Why Is PulteGroup (PHM) Up 1.8% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-pultegroup-phm-1-8-153103955.html,1685028663,STORY,['PHM'],"[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for PulteGroup (PHM). Shares have added about 1.8% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PulteGroup due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.PulteGroupâs Q1 Earnings &amp; Revenue BeatPulteGroup started 2023 on an impressive note. The company reported first-quarter 2023 results, wherein earnings and revenues surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased year over year.The company witnessed solid gross orders, closings and margins in the first quarter and posted a 28% increase in earnings per share (EPS) and a 12-month return on equity of 32%.Inside the HeadlinesAdjusted EPS came in at $2.35, which topped the consensus mark of $1.78 by 32% and increased 28.4% from $1.83 per share a year ago. The upside was driven by gains in revenues, improved gross margins and overhead leverage.Total revenues of $5.58 billion also beat the consensus mark of $3.27 billion by 9.4% and increased 13.5% from the year-ago figure of $3.15 billion.Segment DiscussionPulteGroup primarily operates through two business segments â Homebuilding and Financial Services.Revenues from the Homebuilding segment were up 14.8% year over year to $5.52 billion. Home sale revenues of $3.49 billion increased 15.1% year over year, mainly due to the higher average price of homes closed and higher deliveries. Land sale revenues also declined 9.3% from a year ago to $30.1 million.The number of homes closed increased 6% from the year-ago level to 6,394 units. The average selling price of homes delivered was $545,000, up 9% year over year.Most importantly, its backlog, which represents orders yet to be closed, was 13,129 units, down from 19,935 units a year ago. In addition, potential housing revenues from backlog decreased 30.8% from the prior-year quarter to $8 billion.Gross home orders grew 1% year over year to 8,898 units. Net new home orders dropped 8% year over year to 7,354 units for the quarter. This resulted in a cancelation rate of 13%, up from 4% in the prior-year period. Home orders were down across all operating regions served, barring Southeast and Florida. The value of net new orders also declined 20% from a year ago to $3.8 billion.Home sales gross margin was down 20 basis points (bps) year over year to 29.1% for the reported quarter. SG&amp;A expenses (as a percentage of home sales revenues) improved 130 bps to 9.6%. Operating margin increased by 100 bps year over year to 19.5%.Revenues from the Financial Services segment declined 31.1% year over year to $57.9 million. Pretax income for the segment decreased to $14 million from $41 million a year ago. The decline was due to a reduction in loan volumes owing to a fall in capture rate to 78% compared with 81% last year and the more competitive pricing environment.Story continuesFinancialsAt the end of Mar 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $1.33 billion, up from $1.09 billion in 2022-end. Net debt-to-capital was 7.2% at the first-quarter end, down from 9.6% at 2022-end.Net cash provided by operating activities was $711.4 million in the first quarter, up from $207.7 million a year ago.In first-quarter 2023, the company repurchased 2.8 million common shares for $150 million at an average price of $54.30 per share. Meanwhile, PHM also approved a $1.0 billion increase to its share repurchase authorization.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted 33.98% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, PulteGroup has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise PulteGroup has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Johnson &amp; Johnson The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$23.9bUS$25.8bUS$27.1bUS$28.1bUS$29.0bUS$29.8bUS$30.6bUS$31.3bUS$32.0bUS$32.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 2.73%Est @ 2.54%Est @ 2.41%Est @ 2.32%Est @ 2.26% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$22.4kUS$22.6kUS$22.2kUS$21.5kUS$20.8kUS$20.0kUS$19.2kUS$18.4kUS$17.6kUS$16.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$202bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 Ã (1 + g) Ã· (r â g) = US$33bÃ (1 + 2.1%) Ã· (6.9%â 2.1%) = US$704bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$704bÃ· ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$362bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$564b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$157, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 22% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Johnson &amp; Johnson as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Johnson &amp; JohnsonStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Pharmaceuticals market.Shareholders have been diluted in the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1%.Segment DetailsThe company generates revenues from four major segments, namely Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medical Surgical Portfolio, Neuroscience Portfolio and Diabetes.In the fiscal fourth quarter, Cardiovascular revenues increased 12% at CER to $3.32 billion, with all three divisions reporting organic growth this quarter.Cardiac Rhythm &amp; Heart Failure sales totaled $1.58 billion, up 1.8% year over year at CER.

The company's Q4 organic revenue results reflect strong performances in the Cardiovascular, Medical Surgical, and Neuroscience portfolios, and in Diabetes markets outside the United States. During the quarter, the company received the FDA approval for the MiniMed 780G system with the Guardian 4 sensor.However, a substantial decline in Medical Surgical revenues is a concern. The contraction of both margins raises apprehension too. Macroeconomic headwinds related to persistent inflation and unfavorable foreign currency movements continue to challenge the companyâs earnings performance.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced their quarterly results are Hologic, Inc.

Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $1.87 billion, up 8.03% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $7.63 per share and revenue of $7.2 billion, which would represent changes of +3.39% and +3.01%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Crown Castle.

Its strong and creditworthy tenant base adds resiliency to its business and helps generate steady revenues. However, customer concentration and consolidation in the wireless industry are key concerns for the company.Crown Castle's portfolio of towers has a strong presence in the top 100 basic trading areas of the United States. The company's investment in fiber and small cell business, through acquisitions, constructions, and new deployments, complements its tower business and supports its 5G growth strategy. CCI operated more than 40,000 cell towers and approximately 85,000 route miles as of first-quarter 2023 end. Also, management expects to double the rate of small cell deployments this year compared with the 5,000 nodes it put on air in 2022 to meet the growing customer demand.Crown Castle has long-term (typically 5-15 years) tower lease agreements with top U.S. carriers, which contribute to recurring site rental cash flows over the long term. Also, contracted rent escalators on most of its revenues offer embedded growth. For 2023, management expects total site rental revenues to be between $6,488 and $6,533 million. We project the same to increase 3.5% year over year.Crown Castle has sufficient liquidity and a decent balance sheet position. As of Mar 31, 2023, the net debt to last quarterâs annualized adjusted EBITDA was 5.0X. It has limited maturities through 2024, with a weighted average term to maturity of nine years. As of the first-quarter end, it had more than $5.5 billion of available liquidity under its revolving credit facility.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Crown Castle is committed to that. The companyâs dividends are supported by high-quality, long-term contracted lease payments and it benefits from being a provider of mission-critical shared communication infrastructure assets. CCI has increased its dividend five times in the last five years and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 9.06%. Check Crown Castleâs dividend history here.However, the companyâs debt and other long-term obligations aggregated $21.5 billion as of the first-quarter 2023 end. Moreover, in an elevated interest rate environment, additional borrowings to fund near-term capital expenditures will not only inflate its debt but also raise the cost of borrowings. Management expects to incur interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs between $814 million and $859 million in 2023. Our estimation for the same indicates a year-over-year rise of 22.5%.Also, Crown Castle faces high customer concentration, with T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, and Verizon accounting for around three-fourths of its site rental revenues as of Mar 31, 2023. The loss of any of these customers or their consolidation would have a significant impact on the company's revenues. Particularly, the companyâs 2023 financial results are likely to be affected as T-Mobile is expected to cancel part of its tower, small cell and fiber leases over the next few years in relation to the consolidation of a legacy Sprint network. Additionally, any reduction or rationalization in network spending by carriers could impact Crown Castle's performance. Although per our estimates, net revenues are likely to exhibit modest year-over-year growth of 2.8% in 2023, the same is anticipated to decline 2.1% in 2024.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 19.3% over the past six months compared with the industry's decline of 8.3%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Host Hotels &amp; Resorts HST, and EastGroup Properties EGP, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

These data will be presented on Monday, June 5 at 12:54 p.m. EDT during an oral abstract session at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting (Abstract #4502). After four years of follow-up, KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA maintained a clinically meaningful OS benefit versus sunitinib, reducing the risk of death by 21% (HR=0.79 [95% CI, 0.63-0.99]). The 24- and 36-month estimated OS rates were 80.4% and 66.4% for KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus 69.6% and 60.2% for sunitinib, respectively. Results from the final pre-specified OS analysis were consistent with the superior results versus sunitinib from the primary OS analysis of the CLEAR/KEYNOTE-581 trial.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230525005824/en/Additionally, KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 53% (HR=0.47 [95% CI, 0.38-0.57]), with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 23.9 months (95% CI, 20.8-27.7) versus 9.2 months (95% CI, 6.0-11.0) for sunitinib; the objective response rate (ORR) was 71.3% (95% CI, 66.6-76.0) with a complete response (CR) rate of 18.3% for KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus an ORR of 36.7% (95% CI, 31.7-41.7) with a CR rate of 4.8% for sunitinib.Story continuesThere were no new safety signals and the safety profile at the final OS analysis was consistent with the primary analysis. Grade â¥3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) occurred in 74.1% of patients who received KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus 60.3% of patients who received sunitinib. The six most common TRAEs of any grade of patients in the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA arm were diarrhea (56.0%), hypertension (54.3%), hypothyroidism (44.9%), decreased appetite (35.5%), fatigue (34.1%) and stomatitis (32.7%). In the sunitinib arm, the six most common TRAEs of any grade were diarrhea (45.3%), hypertension (40.3%), stomatitis (37.4%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (36.2%), fatigue (32.9%) and nausea (28.2%).""KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA continues to demonstrate durable clinical benefit as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, as shown by the clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival sustained with four years of follow up,"" said Dr. Thomas Hutson, DO, Pharm.D., FACP, Director of the Urologic Oncology Program and Co-chair of the Urologic Cancer Research and Treatment Center, Texas Oncology at Baylor Sammons Cancer Center. ""Furthermore, these data also showed clinically meaningful improvements in median PFS and ORR compared to sunitinib. These findings reinforce the important role of KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA as a first-line standard of care treatment option for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.""""Long-term follow up data from the CLEAR/KEYNOTE-581 trial show the responses to first-line use of KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA were durable for many of these patients,"" said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, Vice President, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""Through our joint clinical development program with Eisai, weâre continuing to advance our research evaluating KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA for other challenging cancers as we strive to help even more patients.""""At the final pre-specified analysis, KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA continued to demonstrate clinically meaningful efficacy across PFS, ORR and OS, providing patients and their physicians with new information about treating people living with advanced renal cell carcinoma,"" said Corina Dutcus, M.D., Senior Vice President, Clinical Development, Oncology at Eisai Inc. ""These results are a testament to our steadfast commitment to people living with advanced cancers, and we are grateful for the support from the patients, families and healthcare provider community for their participation in this research.""KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA is approved in the U.S., the EU, Japan and other countries for the treatment of advanced RCC and certain types of advanced endometrial carcinoma. Lenvatinib is marketed as KISPLYXÂ® for advanced RCC in the EU. Merck and Eisai are studying the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination through the LEAP (LEnvatinib And Pembrolizumab) clinical program in various tumor types, including but not limited to endometrial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, RCC, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer and esophageal cancer across multiple clinical trials.Study design and additional data from CLEAR/KEYNOTE-581The CLEAR/KEYNOTE-581 trial is a multicenter, randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02811861) evaluating LENVIMA in combination with KEYTRUDA or in combination with everolimus versus sunitinib for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC. The major efficacy outcome measures were PFS, as assessed by independent radiologic review (IRC) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), and OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures included confirmed ORR as assessed by IRC, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and safety.The trial enrolled 1,069 patients who were randomized 1:1:1 to receive KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously every three weeks for up to 24 months) plus LENVIMA (20 mg orally once daily), or LENVIMA (18 mg orally once daily) plus everolimus (5 mg orally once daily), or sunitinib (50 mg orally once daily for four weeks on treatment, followed by two weeks off treatment). KEYTRUDA was administered for up to 35 cycles (approximately two years) or until protocol-specified discontinuation criteria were met. After completing two years of combination therapy, LENVIMA may have been administered as a single agent until protocol-specified discontinuation criteria were met.This final pre-specified OS analysis was event driven and was triggered by approximately 304 OS target events in the two treatment arms (149 events out of 355 patients for KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus 159 events out of 357 patients for sunitinib).The median duration of response was 26.7 months (95% CI, 22.8-34.6) for KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus 14.7 months (95% CI, 9.4-18.2) for sunitinib.Efficacy results were consistent across the pre-specified Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk groups (favorable, intermediate and poor) and International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk groups. Across the pre-specified Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk groups (favorable, intermediate and poor), OS and PFS were improved with KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus sunitinib. Interpretation OS in favorable risk patients is limited by low number of events.Fewer patients who were treated with KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA received subsequent anti-cancer therapies (181 out of 355 patients, 51.0%) versus those who were treated with sunitinib (246 out of 357 patients, 68.9%), with 56 patients (15.8%) and 195 patients (54.6%) who went on to receive PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors, respectively. In an exploratory analysis using a 2-stage model, KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA reduced the risk of death by 45% versus sunitinib when adjusted for subsequent anticancer medications (HR=0.55 [95% CI, 0.44-0.69]).About renal cell carcinoma (RCC)Worldwide, it is estimated there were more than 431,000 new cases of kidney cancer diagnosed and more than 179,000 deaths from the disease in 2020 [GLOBOCAN, 2020]. Renal cell carcinoma is by far the most common type of kidney cancer; about nine out of 10 kidney cancer diagnoses are RCC [ACS, 2020]. Renal cell carcinoma is about twice as common in men as in women [ACS, 2023]. Most cases of RCC are discovered incidentally during imaging tests for other abdominal diseases [American Family Physician, 2019]. Approximately 30% of patients with RCC will have metastatic disease at diagnosis [American Family Physician, 2019]. Survival is highly dependent on the stage at diagnosis, and the five-year survival rate is 15% for patients diagnosed with metastatic disease [ACS, 2023].About KEYTRUDAÂ® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the bodyâs immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industryâs largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDAÂ® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Renal Cell CarcinomaKEYTRUDA, in combination with axitinib, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).KEYTRUDA, in combination with LENVIMA, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC.KEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of patients with RCC at intermediate-high or high risk of recurrence following nephrectomy, or following nephrectomy and resection of metastatic lesions.See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of antiâPD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT â¥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT â¥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT â¥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Thyroid DisordersKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients.Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism.Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic KetoacidosisMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA.

All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Immune-Mediated Nephritis With Renal DysfunctionKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with antiâPD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other antiâPD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after antiâPD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between antiâPD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using antiâPD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an antiâPD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

If urine dipstick proteinuria â¥2+ is detected, obtain a 24-hour urine protein. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.Diarrhea. Of the 737 LENVIMA-treated patients in DTC and HCC, diarrhea occurred in 49% (6% grade 3). In RCC, diarrhea occurred in 81% of LENVIMA + everolimusâtreated patients (19% grade 3). Diarrhea was the most frequent cause of dose interruption/reduction, and diarrhea recurred despite dose reduction. Promptly initiate management of diarrhea. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.Fistula Formation and Gastrointestinal Perforation. Of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus in DTC, RCC, and HCC, fistula or gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 2%. Permanently discontinue in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation of any severity or grade 3-4 fistula.QT Interval Prolongation. In DTC, QT/QTc interval prolongation occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QT interval prolongation of &gt;500 ms occurred in 2%. In RCC, QTc interval increases of &gt;60 ms occurred in 11% of patients receiving LENVIMA + everolimus and QTc interval &gt;500 ms occurred in 6%. In HCC, QTc interval increases of &gt;60 ms occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QTc interval &gt;500 ms occurred in 2%.Monitor and correct electrolyte abnormalities at baseline and periodically during treatment. Monitor electrocardiograms in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or those who are taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery based on severity.Hypocalcemia. In DTC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In 65% of cases, hypocalcemia improved or resolved following calcium supplementation with or without dose interruption or dose reduction. In RCC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 6% of LENVIMA + everolimusâtreated patients. In HCC, grade 3 hypocalcemia occurred in 0.8% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor blood calcium levels at least monthly and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity.Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS). Across clinical studies of 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms.Hemorrhagic Events. Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC, RCC, and HCC clinical trials, hemorrhagic events, of any grade, occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimusâtreated patients, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials.Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC, 88% of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level â¤0.5 mU/L. In patients with normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level &gt;0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In RCC and HCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + everolimusâtreated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimusâtreated patients in RCC.Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice.Impaired Wound Healing. Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ). ONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease, or invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ.Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA.Avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ.Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution.EmbryoâFetal Toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for 30 days after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn DTC, the most common adverse reactions (â¥30%) observed in LENVIMA-treated patients were hypertension (73%), fatigue (67%), diarrhea (67%), arthralgia/myalgia (62%), decreased appetite (54%), decreased weight (51%), nausea (47%), stomatitis (41%), headache (38%), vomiting (36%), proteinuria (34%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (32%), abdominal pain (31%), and dysphonia (31%).

(MRK): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-merck-co-130013923.html,1685019613,STORY,['MRK'],"[Merck (MRK) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +0.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Merck falls in, has lost 2.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.85 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -7.1%. This estimate has changed +1.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.46 indicates a change of +21.7% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Merck.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MRK _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Merck, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.42 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -1.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $58.79 billion and $62.66 billion estimates indicate -0.8% and +6.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $14.49 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -8.9%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $2.14 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.84 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.65%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

156,a7aaeaba-b418-3ea3-a502-30cea93e25fb,MOS,2023-05-26,Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) Is Paying Out A Larger Dividend Than Last Year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mosaic-nyse-mos-paying-larger-190559868.html,1685041559,STORY,['MOS'],"[The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 15th of June to $0.20. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 2.3%.While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Mosaic's stock price has reduced by 32% in the last 3 months, which is not ideal for investors and can explain a sharp increase in the dividend yield. See our latest analysis for Mosaic Mosaic's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Before making this announcement, Mosaic was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.EPS is set to fall by 56.6% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 22%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.00 total annually to $0.80. This works out to be a decline of approximately 2.2% per year over that time. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Mosaic has impressed us by growing EPS at 59% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.Story continuesMosaic Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Mosaic is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. To that end, Mosaic has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is significant) we think you should know about. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Illumina Illumina Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn fact, the recent sale by Susan Tousi was the biggest sale of Illumina shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$194. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Illumina better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Illumina Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Illumina. In total, Chief Commercial Officer Susan Tousi sold US$1.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Does Illumina Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Illumina insiders own about US$46m worth of shares. That equates to 0.1% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Illumina Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought Illumina stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. We'd practice some caution before buying! If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

He will take the seat of board Chairman John Thompson, who failed to win reelection.Illumina's market value of $30 billion made the fight this year's largest proxy contest to go to a shareholder vote. Its shares closed down 9% at $193.53 on Thursday after Icahn failed in his bid to change the company's management by also ousting Chief Executive Francis deSouza from the board.Icahn had accused Illumina of poor oversight, especially with regard to its $7.1 billion acquisition of cancer test maker Grail. Illumina completed the deal despite opposition from U.S. and European antitrust regulators, who are now trying to force the company to unwind it. Icahn argued that Illumina lost $50 billion in value following the deal because investors worry that the company will be forced to divest Grail at a big loss.Icahn is battling to restore Wall Street's confidence in his investment acumen. Shares of investment company Icahn Enterprises LP have lost 60% of their value since May 2, when a Hindenburg Research report accused it of artificially inflating its dividend yield and the value of its assets. Icahn has denied the claims.Icahn Enterprises shares lost another 14% on Thursday, reaching their lowest level since 2004, after hedge fund veteran William Ackman tweeted more criticism about the company's finances.Icahn rejected an offer from Illumina earlier this year for a board seat for one of his nominees and another seat for an independent candidate that would have averted the proxy battle.Story continuesThat arrangement would not necessarily have been the same as the outcome of the vote, given that it led to Thompson's ouster.""I look forward to serving on behalf of all shareholders and stakeholders. I am happy to say that activism is alive and well at Icahn,"" Teno said in a statement.The Illumina board battle was one of the first conducted under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's universal proxy rules, which came into force last August. The rules allow shareholders to pick and choose among board director nominees in opposing slates, as opposed to voting only for entire slates. Some companies lobbied against the changes, arguing it favored activist investors.Illumina shareholders also voted against the pay arrangements of top executives in an another blow to the company. The vote was non-binding, but companies often take up such shareholder rulings. The CEO compensation package for deSouza reached $26.8 million in 2022, up from $14.3 million in 2021, according to a regulatory filing.

However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for ANSYS shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, ANSYS is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Computer - Software industry that ranks in the Top 42% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while five analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.86 per share to $1.60 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about ANSYS right now, this huge implied volatility could mean thereâs a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

With support from the Wells Fargo Foundation, more than 6,500 high school students entered the unique competition that engages, motivates and rewards high school students for their knowledge of economic principles and the world's changing global economy.Teams from Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, New Hampshire, New York and Texas also earned finalist honors in the two NEC divisions.""Our congratulations to the top finishers, the finalists and indeed to all students and educators who participated in the National Economics Challenge this year,"" said Nan J.

The NEC makes learning economics fun by asking each team to apply its skills and knowledge to real world problems, while promoting collaboration and teamwork along with a healthy dose of competition - all useful capabilities for their futures.""The tools of economic analysis also teach students to think logically, use data smartly, and build analytic and problem-solving skills, Morrison added. Requiring economics or personal finance courses in schools across America would help ensure every young adult can develop the skills the Challenge teams have shown. Yet only half the states require a course in economics, according to CEE's latest Survey of the States.""We're excited to congratulate all of the incredible students who competed in the 2023 National Economics Challenge and also gained valuable financial capability skills that will be used throughout their lives,"" said Bonnie Wallace, head of Financial Health Philanthropy at Wells Fargo.

Some European governments have destroyed doses.The amended contract matches ""evolving needs"", said EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides in a statement.For more than two months Kyriakides has been urging EU member states to accept the contract amendment negotiated by the European Commission.The Commission said in its statement on Friday that some member states had decided to opt out of the amended deal, declining to name which countries.Those countries will continue to be bound by the current contract, the statement read. A Commission source said that those countries were Poland and Hungary.The original contract was signed in May 2021 and committed the EU to buy 900 million doses from Pfizer/BioNTech, with an option for an additional 900 million, by the end of 2023.About half or more of the first 900 million doses from that contract have not yet been delivered because demand dropped last year. The EU has not exercised the additional option.The statements from the European Commission and Pfizer/BioNTech did not specify the size of the reduction in doses that was agreed.But a source with knowledge of the negotiations told Reuters that the contract change cuts by about a third the number of those remaining doses the EU is on the hook to buy. The source sought anonymity to discuss the confidential talks.The EU member states will have to pay a fee for each cancelled dose, the source said, while declining to say what the fee would be. The companies and the Commission also declined to comment on this.The amended contract specifies that the EU will continue to have access to vaccines adapted to new variants as soon as they are authorised by regulators.

181,246a8770-99c4-3fa5-9e24-2df7341e9451,PFE,2023-05-26,"Pfizer trades at pre-pandemic levels, frustrating investors",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/pfizer-trades-pre-pandemic-low-200944282.html,1685045384,VIDEO,['PFE'],"[Yahoo Finance health care reporter Anjalee Khemlani analyzes shares of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer as the FDA issues its full approval of the COVID-19 treatment drug Paxlovid.Video Transcript- Given the success of its vaccine and its antiviral medication Paxlovid you would think that Pfizer would be one of the big winners from the COVID-19 pandemic. But not so much. The stock is actually down 25% so far this year. Basically flat going back to the start of the pandemic. Yahoo Finance senior health reporter Anjalee Khemlani joining us now. And Anj, when you take a look at that under-performance there, why do you think that is, and what do you think investors should make of this?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, investors have had a pretty interesting look on this stock. And we've seen this pressure on Pfizer since the pandemic times, actually. You saw, even with the approval of its vaccines, it didn't skyrocket the way that you saw other of its competitors like Moderna and Eli Lilly with the monoclonal antibody.We did see a note from Goldman Sachs after meeting with management saying, quote, ""following the anticipated completion of the SGEN deal, repayment of the leverage taken on from the transaction is a top priority for the company. And then incremental share repurchases are also possible. Then management would look to increase the extent of capital they return to shareholders either through repurchases or greater dividend.""And that's something that investors have been waiting to hear. They've been waiting to hear how they're going to reallocate all of that unprecedented COVID windfall. We know that if you look at that historical data looking at that stock, it has been largely flat.You've also seen analyst recommendations largely look-- or largely recommend holding the stock, which has been true for year over year since 2020. I took a look back all the way since then. And it's been a majority of investors saying, hold. Meanwhile, Pfizer has been frustrated about this.Story continuesI've had conversations with CEO Albert Bourla about this exact topic dating back to those first approvals of the vaccine. And he told me as recently as last month quote, ""although I'm not happy, all we can do is to execute on our strategy so that investors will see that this is a good growth opportunity."" Now we know that some of the pressures facing the company include loss of exclusivity.Those patents expiring for more than a dozen of its products, but they also are looking to fill that pipeline with the RSV vaccine, with the acquisition from Seagen and a couple of other small acquisitions that have taken place. So all told, it's definitely something where it's just a wait-and-see for this stock. The company saying repeatedly that its stock has been undervalued, and investors are saying, well, we'll wait and find out.- Angalee, you mentioned Paxlovid. It did get full FDA approval today. For Pfizer, specifically, what does this mean?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. So now that it's fully approved, we know that this drug can be marketed as well. Up until this point, it was just available through the US government. This falls in line with what we know is expected for all COVID products if they do get to the approval line now that the public health emergency is over.So that is a positive for the company, and still, the stock knot up on that, just tying back to the earlier commentary. So interesting but a really good positive for the company right now.- Yeah. I mean, you mentioned accessibility now with the FDA stamp of approval there. What have we heard from Pfizer in the past about the reach they see with this particular drug?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, it is the only oral drug available. It's a five-course-- five pill course, and it is available for the most vulnerable, the elderly, as well as some younger individuals who are most likely to be exposed to COVID and have more negative reactions. So this helps to keep them out of the hospital.So this accessibility now opens up availability in pharmacies and doctor's offices and the like. So it really gives it a broader range of patients. And this has been one of the problems of accessibility when the US government was in charge of distribution. So it's likely that we'll see some of that movement there.- All right, Anj. Thanks.]"

Four of the most well-known and often-used of these apps are PayPal, Venmo, Zelle and Cash App, which vary in popularity among users, according to data from Pew Research.See Our List:Â 100 Most Influential Money ExpertsRead:Â How To Build Your Savings From ScratchWhile all of these apps were designed for the same purpose â as P2P payment services â each one functions a little bit differently. If youâre struggling with which one should be your go-to when you need to send money quickly, hereâs how to determine which money transfer app works best for you.PayPalIf deciding was based on popularity, PayPal would be the winner. The majority of U.S. adults have used PayPal over any other money transfer app â approximately 57%, according to Pew Research. The app is most popular with adults aged 18-29 and adults aged 30-49. Itâs also the money transfer app of choice by far for adults 50-64 and 65+. Hereâs how that breaks down by users in each of the following age groups:Adults 18-29: 63%Adults 30-49: 66%Adults 50-64: 55%Adults 65+: 41%PayPal is known for its ease of use. You can send money with a host of payment options, including your credit or debit card, PayPal balance or your bank account. This is extremely convenient and not something every money transfer app offers. However, you will pay a 2.9% fee + $0.30 per money transfer transaction you make with your debit or credit card. So if this is something you will often do, youâll need to factor in the extra cost.If you have PayPal Credit, you can also use it to send money to family and friends. The fee is the same amount youâll incur for using a debit or credit card. However, money sent from your PayPal balance or bank account is free of fees. You can also send money internationally to over 200 countries, which is not standard among these types of apps.Story continuesCash App Borrow: How To Borrow Money on Cash AppVenmoVenmo, which is owned by PayPal, is the next most-popular money transfer app, with 38% of U.S. adults having used it. It appeals mostly to adults aged 18-29, followed by adults aged 30-49. By age group, hereâs how many adults use Venmo:Adults 18-29: 57%Adults 30-49: 49%Adults 50-64: 28%Adults 65+: 15%Venmo advertises its ease of use and has an advantage over PayPal in that it does not charge a fee if you send money from a linked debit card. Itâs also free to send money from your linked bank account or Venmo balance. However, there is a 3% fee for sending money from your credit card, and you canât send money internationally like you can with PayPal.ZelleZelle has been used at least once by 36% of U.S. adults. Again adults aged 18-29 and 30-49 are most likely to use this app. Hereâs how that breaks down by age group:Adults 18-29: 48%Adults 30-49: 46%Adults 50-64: 29%Adults 65+: 20%Zelle is fast when it comes to money transfers, and there are no fees involved. However, itâs likely less popular than PayPal or Venmo because itâs not as convenient to use.One drawback of Zelle is that either the sender or the receiver involved in the payment transaction must have access to Zelle through their bank or credit union, and not all banks and credit unions are members of the network. Additionally, Zelle only allows you to send and receive money via a Visa or Mastercard debit card thatâs tied to a bank account â you canât use a credit card. Zelle doesnât allow users to send money internationally, either.Cash AppCash App is the least-used of these money transfer apps, with only 26% of U.S. adults ever choosing it. Adults aged 65+ use this app the least of all four money transfer apps. Hereâs how the users break down by age:Adults 18-29: 39%Adults 30-49: 35%Adults 50-64: 19%Adults 65+: 9%With Cash App, users can send money through a credit card, debit card, Cash App balance or bank account to anyoneâs phone number, email, or $cashtag. However, there is a 3% fee to send money with a credit card. Cash App is unique in that it also allows users to send money, stocks or bitcoin within the app. Like PayPal, you can also send money internationally with Cash App, but only to the UK or EU.Which Money Transfer App Works Best for You?A couple of things to consider are that PayPal, Venmo and Cash App offer a variety of payment methods, while Zelle does not allow you to send money via credit card and requires the sender or receiver to be connected to a bank that supports it. Also, only PayPal and Cash App allow for international transactions, with PayPal offering more than 200 countries.However, the money transfer app that works best for you is the one that offers the features and payment methods you need to fit in with your lifestyle. Additionally, youâll want to choose a money transfer app that results in the least amount of fees when you use it.More From GOBankingRates10 Aldi Brand Products Worth BuyingSee GOBankingRates' Top 100 Most Influential Money Experts and Get Advice3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,00048 Easy Things You Can Do To Live Better and Save MoneyThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How To Determine Which Money Transfer App Works Best for You]"

This unfortunate event resulted in the death of a worker and hospitalization of two others, raising concerns about safety within the refinery.As the news of the incident spread, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (âOSHAâ) initiated an investigation to assess the circumstances that caused the fire and determine the appropriate course of action.Purpose of OSHA's InvestigationThe sudden fire breakout prompted emergency response efforts from Marathon Petroleumâs dedicated crew. The case drew immediate attention, prompting OSHA to step in and conduct a thorough investigation of the same. The objective was to determine the cause of the incident, evaluate safety protocols and hold accountable parties responsible for any lapses or violations of industry regulations.MPC's Confirmation and Lack of DetailsMarathon Petroleum has confirmed OSHA's ongoing investigation into the fire incident at its Galveston Bay refinery.According to the Oil Price Information Service, MPC has not released specific details regarding the extent of the damage or the potential impact of the incident within the refinery. Â There are market speculations regarding the gasoline production unit being offline for an extended period. Management, however, has refrained from commenting on the same.The Role of Ultraformer Unit No. 3In a filing submitted to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, Marathon Petroleum disclosed that the Ultraformer Unit No. 3 at the Galveston Bay refinery was involved in the accident. This unit plays a crucial role in upgrading heavy naphtha into gasoline blendstock by increasing its octane level.The reforming process is essential in the production of high-quality gasoline that meets stringent industry standards and customer expectations.Story continuesConclusionThe tragic incident serves as a dark reminder of the potential risks associated with the energy industry. While OSHA diligently investigates the incident to determine the cause and evaluate safety measures, Marathon Petroleum continues to cooperate with the authorities.In order to understand the incident and its implications for the company, we have to await official statements and updates from reliable sources.Zacks Rank and Key Picks Marathon Petroleum currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the energy sector are Evolution Petroleum EPM, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Archrock AROC and Ranger Energy Services RNGR, each holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can seeÂ the complete list of todayâs Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Evolution Petroleum: EPM is worth approximately $219.16 million.

191,f97fb9bf-34a8-3e9c-9efd-4b76c28637dc,WAT,2023-05-26,Waters: A Solid Medical Devices Company,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waters-solid-medical-devices-company-223540332.html,1685054140,STORY,['WAT'],"[In the first quarter of 2023, eight investing gurus bought shares of Waters Corp. (NYSE:WAT), and only one sold. Why all that interest?Was it driven by an expectation that the share price might begin to recover? It has been on a steady slide since late August of 2021. And it is now just 2% above its 52-week low.Could it reflect the overall price stagnation in the medical diagnostics and research industry, which began slipping in September 2021?WAT 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of WATPeter Lynch Chart of WATNo doubt price is a factor in their decisions, but it is also possible they might be impressed by Waters excellent fundamentals: an enviable 97 out of 100 on the GF Score.Waters: A Solid Medical Devices CompanyWhat does the company do? According to the 10-K for 2022, Waters has provided high-value analytical technologies and industry leading scientific expertise, with solutions that serve life, materials and food sciences.More specifically, it designs, manufactures and sells tools for liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis. However, it has a relatively diverse set of revenue generators within its niche.Waters: A Solid Medical Devices CompanyThe original company was formed by Jim Waters in 1958. Organically and through acquisitions, it has grown into a $15.26 billion company, with 2022 revenue of $2.97 billion.One starting point for examining the strength of its fundamentals would be its margins. They have been relatively high and consistent, with one exception in 2018.Waters: A Solid Medical Devices CompanyThose margins also support net income and help provide funding for share repurchases. Combining higher net income and fewer shares leads to greater earnings per share.Waters: A Solid Medical Devices CompanyHigh levels of profitability should also generate free cash flow, which can then be invested for more growth in the future. Unfortunately, FCF has fallen in four of the past five years.Waters: A Solid Medical Devices CompanyWaters' annual filing for 2022 had an explanation for the pullback: The Company generated $612 million, $747 million and $791 million of net cash flows provided by operating activities in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in 2022 operating cash flow was primarily a result of higher inventory levels, slower cash collections and higher incentive compensation payments in 2022 compared to 2021.Story continuesThe filing for 2021 provided this information for that year: The decrease in operating cash flow in 2021 was primarily a result of the $100 million of 2020 cost actions and working capital improvements implemented being reinstated once customer demand increased.So it does not seem that the slower cash flow is the result of some deep-seated problem; instead, it is more like the meat and potatoes of running a business in turbulent times.Theoretically, that still leaves a hefty amount of cash available for organic growth, since it does not pay a dividend. However, Waters board of directors had other ideas. It noted, During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company repurchased $616 million and $640 million of the Companys outstanding common stock, respectively, under authorized share repurchase programs.From a financial strength perspective, it carries a modest debt load. That produces a comfortable interest coverage ratio of 16.33 and a high Altman Z-Score of 9.26.What is most striking about its financial metrics is the return on invested capital versus the weighted average cost of capital relationship. Waters is clearly a value creator:Waters: A Solid Medical Devices CompanyFor 2022, the WACC was 8.77% and the ROIC was 30.19%.Its growth rates are not particularly high, but they are sufficient for most investors. Over the past three years, revenue grew by an average of 11.70% per year, Ebitda increased by an average of 11.40% and earnings per share without NRI averaged growth of 10.50% per year.The company has been able to grow both its revenue and Ebitda quite consistently. That has resulted in a high predictability ranking of 4.5 out of five stars.As noted, Waters has aggressively bought back its own shares, and over the past 10 years that has worked out to an average of just under 3% per year. Thats good for shareholdersand makes it easier for management to grow earnings per share.Turning to valuation, the GF Value Line considers the company to be modestly undervalued. It sees an intrinsic value of $352.77, while the closing price on May 24 was $256.99. That is a $95.78 difference, or a 37% margin of safety.Waters: A Solid Medical Devices CompanyWaters has a price-earnings multiple of 22.33, which is very close to the industry median of 23.10. The PEG ratio, based on a five-year Ebitda growth rate of 11.50% per year, works out to 1.94. Thats near the top end of the fair valuation range.The discounted cash flow calculator comes to a bearish conclusion. Based on an initial growth rate of 9.20%, which is the 10-year average for earnings per share without NRI, it puts the fair value at $190.21. Thats $66.78 below the current price, and indicates a negative margin of safety of 35.11%.If we put a trendline on a 10-year chart, we end up with a price that is very close to the GF Value price:Waters: A Solid Medical Devices CompanyPotential investors will need to pick the optimistic, pessimistic or current value option when they assess the company.Eight of the guru investors added to or set up new Waters holdings in the first quarter of this year. One reduced its holding and two others made no changes, according to 13F filings.The top three investors as of March 31 were the Vanguard Health Care Fund (Trades, Portfolio) (811,122 shares), PRIMECAP Management (Trades, Portfolio) (77,844 shares) and Baillie Gifford (Trades, Portfolio) with 55,543 shares.Institutional investors have a solid position in the company, holding 69.03% of the shares outstanding. Insiders accounted for another 4.94%. The largest single shareholder among the insiders is Edward Conrad, a former director, who held 74,542 shares at the end of March. Dr. Udit Batra, the president and CEO, has a relatively small investment of 8,523 shares.Investors should be aware 13F filings do not give a complete picture of a firms holdings as the reports only include its positions in U.S. stocks and American depository receipts, but they can still provide valuable information. Further, the reports only reflect trades and holdings as of the most-recent portfolio filing date, which may or may not be held by the reporting firm today or even when this article was published.In conclusion, Waters is a solid company with a fair to depressed share price (I'm an optimist). It is a reasonable candidate for investors who want capital gains, especially when the size of the gains may be helped along by share repurchases.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

196,3332642b-2f97-3016-9f05-dbebd03fe760,GM,2023-05-26,Tesla's Promising Future,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-promising-future-153410441.html,1685028850,STORY,"['TSLA', 'F', 'GM']","[Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may get a lot of flack these days for being overvalued due to the way its stock price shot up, but it's still the first electric vehicle company that proved EVs could be profitable on a massive scale. That counts for a lot, and as a result of this trailblazing, we have seen the company grow into its valuation to a certain extent.Tesla's Promising FutureTSLA Data by GuruFocusTSLA 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of TSLAPeter Lynch Chart of TSLAWhen looking ahead, my outlook on Tesla is highly positive, despite increasing competiton and the slowing economy. With a robust market presence, continued emphasis on safety improvements and new initiatives like the Cybertruck and robotaxi service, the company is positioning itself well for growth.In addition, Tesla stands to gain from the advancing capabilities of its artificial intelligence (AI) technology, particularly in automotive applications such as self-driving cars. Although this opportunity is still in its early stages, Tesla possesses unique competitive strengths owing to its extensive data collection. This extensive data collection provides Tesla with training for its AI algorithms, enabling the company to enhance the performance and safety of its self-driving technology.The future is already hereTesla's continued relevance and success depend on its ability to stay ahead of the curve. Fortunately, Tesla is actively striving to maintain its position as an industry leader and secure its future.Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) program has achieved a significant milestone, with FSD Beta users collectively surpassing 150 million miles driven. This extensive data collection sets a new benchmark in the industry and plays a crucial role in the development of scalable autonomy through AI-driven approaches. Tesla introduced the latest FSD Beta software stack in the first quarter of 2023, with a specific focus on highway driving. While the potential of expanded FSD capabilities remains speculative, the prospects for increased margins and revenue growth are immense.Story continuesTesla harnesses the power of over-the-air updates to improve multiple facets of its vehicles, encompassing crucial features like airbag deployment and emergency braking systems. Safety is a top priority for Tesla, and the company continuously analyzes accident data to enhance vehicle safety features. This commitment to safety sets Tesla apart, as existing vehicles can receive the latest safety enhancements without customers needing to purchase new models.The highly anticipated Cybertruck remains on schedule for production to commence later this year at Gigafactory Texas. With substantial anticipation surrounding its groundbreaking electric pickup truck, Tesla strives to deliver an impressive quantity of up to 10,000 units in 2023.Although Tesla has articulated its vision for introducing a robotaxi service, specific details regarding the venture have not yet been disclosed. This bold endeavor carries the potential to revolutionize the transportation industry, though for now, it remains in the speculative bin.Tesla's not all about EVs. Its energy storage segment is experiencing rapid growth, surpassing the pace of the automotive sector. This highlights the increasing significance of Tesla's energy storage solutions, as they meet the rising demand for storing solar power and serve as a crucial catalyst in transitioning towards renewable energy sources while ensuring grid stability.Tesla is actively engaged in advancing battery technology, with ongoing research and development efforts focused on significantly reducing the cost of electric vehicles. Tesla aims to make electric vehicles more affordable when compared to traditional gasoline-powered counterparts, further driving the adoption of sustainable transportation.Staying ahead of the packDespite the challenges in the near term, Tesla's volume-focused strategy is the kind of thing investors like to see, as evident from its first-quarter earnings report. Operating margins declined, and operating income fell, but the price cuts seem to be squeezing its less well-capitalized rivals more than Tesla itself.Tesla aims to bolster its market dominance by implementing groundbreaking manufacturing innovations that will slash the cost of next-generation vehicles by 50%. By undertaking this strategic initiative, Tesla intends to position itself to participate in price competition while safeguarding its profit margins effectively. In the first quarter of 2023, Tesla demonstrated solid growth and profitability, with total revenue increasing by 24% year over year. The energy generation and storage sector witnessed remarkable expansion, accompanied by significant growth in automotive revenues.Tesla's production and delivery numbers showed positive growth, with a significant increase in cars produced and delivered compared to the previous year. Although the company's gross margin declined, it is a strategic decision aimed at long-term gains. Tesla remained profitable, generating net income of $2.5 billion on a GAAP basis, despite a decrease from the previous year. The company's balance sheet remains robust, although higher capital expenditures impacted free cash flow.Tesla and its inventory problemOver the past few quarters, Tesla's inventory levels have become a growing concern. Despite its ambitious goal of growing supply by 50% annually, there are signs that the demand might not be keeping pace. When inventory sits idle, it ties up cash on the balance sheet. This results in a buildup of inventory, which can negatively affect the company. If the inventory challenge worsens, it could lead to reduced cash levels and potential difficulties in moving the inventory through the system, resulting in price reductions, squeezed margins and reduced profitability.Comparing Tesla's inventory levels to its competitors, such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F), reveals a notable disparity. While both GM and Ford have dealerships that serve as a buffer between the automaker and the end customer, Tesla lacks this buffer. Consequently, Tesla's inventory levels appear to be higher, indicating a potential inventory problem.The decline in Tesla's cash levels since the beginning of 2021 is another concerning trend associated with rising inventory. As Tesla allocates cash towards inventory buildup, it becomes essential for the company to find ways to sell those goods and convert inventory into cash effectively.Tesla's growth strategy heavily relies on increasing supply, but this necessitates a corresponding increase in demand. If demand fails to keep up, Tesla may face difficult choices - either scaling back supply or resorting to price reductions and lower margins to stimulate demand. Perhaps Tesla needs to focus on advertising to boost demand.TakeawayIn conclusion, I believe Tesla's position in the electric vehicle industry remains strong, driven by its innovative technology, commitment to sustainability and focus on manufacturing efficiency.Tesla's focus on safety enhancements, exciting product offerings like the Cybertruck and potential future ventures such as the robotaxi service contribute to its positive outlook. Furthermore, Tesla's advancements in AI technology and its extensive data collection provide a competitive advantage in the development of self-driving capabilities.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

And that is going to affect things. And I think we're probably somewhat too arrogant in our ability to raise pricing in an easy-demand environment,"" Friedman acknowledged. ""And as the easy demand environment has waned, and it's required us to kind of really challenge, is our value equation going to create the level of demand that we believe is right for the business?""Judging by the latest results from RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, consumers don't see the value in putting a $2,300 wood dining room table on a charge card with a much higher interest rate attached to it. That's especially as the housing market continues to be under pressure.The California-based furnishings retailer's first quarter sales tanked 23% year over year to $739.2 million, it reported Thursday. Gross profit margins dropped to 47% from 52.1% a year earlier.Friedman said RH will now move aggressively to pare down excess inventory this year by offering discounts, which will take a bite out of margins.Full-year adjusted operating margins are pegged in a range of 14.5% to 15.5%, down from 15% to 17%. Sales for the year were guided to $3 billion to $3.1 billion, up from $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion as Friedman bets consumers will bite at his promotions.""$1.5 billion in cash and $1.5 billion remaining in share repurchases create a floor for the stock, though we see limited upside given our view that 20% operating margins may not be on the table until 2025. We believe new product launches under the RH Contemporary line at more amenable price points will spur demand in the second half, but not enough to push above the midpoint of guidance,"" warned Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski in a research note.Story continuesRH's struggles in part reflect poor execution by Friedman, but also the realities of the changing housing markets. The dynamics have tripped up everyone from a high-end furniture seller in RH in the past year to appliance maker Whirlpool to home improvement sellers Home Depot and Lowe's.Existing home sales in April fell 3.4% from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. Home prices declined for the third consecutive month.A new Redfin report this week revealed that nationwide home prices in April notched their steepest decline in more than a decade, declining by $18,000. Median home prices fell in 45 out of more than 90 metro markets, the report found.""We're launching it [our new product line] into maybe the worst home environment at the high end that I've ever seen in my career. I've never seen luxury housing down at the levels we've seen from recent reports and we're at 20-year high interest rates,"" Friedman added on the call.The stage is set for a similar tone from Friedman three months from now.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The company reaffirmed its guidance of full-year revenue declining in the mid single digits.""Our guide for the year implies that we expect year-over-year comp performance to improve as we move through the year and we lap the comparable sales declines we experienced last year,"" Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said on the company's earnings call. ""Based on what we can see right now, we continue to believe that calendar 2023 will be the bottom for the decline in tech demand.""The tech retailer has struggled to match sales comparisons from the pandemic boom over the past several quarters. The most recent quarter's negative comparable sales growth marks the sixth straight quarter of declines in the category.Still, Best Buy's profits surprised Wall Street to the upside in the first quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.15 versus analyst estimates of $1.11, per Bloomberg consensus data. The company's $9.47 billion in quarterly sales fell short of the Street's $9.54 billion estimate.Best Buy stock rose as much as 3% on Thursday before paring gains.Best Buy has seen precipitous drops in sales within its appliance and consumer electronics categories, falling in line with the discretionary spending slowdown called out by Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD). Barry noted on the call that they've been discussing consumers ""clearly making trade-off"" decisions for the past nine months.""What we would say is we've been seeing a consumer who is, whether or not you call it a recession, exhibiting some recessionary behaviors depending on the different category that you're talking about,"" Barry said. ""So it's absolutely unusual. I think as we look ahead, we start to feel like you see the turn in the business as you head out the back half of this year and into next year.""Story continuesBut Best Buy sees things turning around this year, largely due to the cyclical nature of their products. Consumers upgrade or replace tech on a three-to-seven-year timeframe, per Barry, and the second half of this year will mark three years since the pandemic-influenced upgrades made in the second half of 2020.There will also be more innovative products released in the second half of the year, according to Best Buy. The company pointed to the recent success of the Zelda software on Nintendo Switch and ""stronger than expected"" pre-orders for the Asus handheld gaming system as signs that consumers are still responding well to new products.A woman walks with a boy to the Best Buy store at the Mall of New Hampshire, Tuesday, Aug. 4, 2020, in Manchester, N.H.

(ISRG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this company have returned +2.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.4% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Intuitive Surgical, Inc. belongs, has lost 5.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.6%.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.46 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +16.7%. This estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.34 indicates a change of +16.1% from what Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ISRG _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $1.73 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.7%. The $7.11 billion and $8.06 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +14.3% and +13.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIntuitive Surgical, Inc. reported revenues of $1.7 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $1.13 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.88%. The EPS surprise was +3.36%.Over the last four quarters, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Robots, once confined to science fiction, have become a critical part of our daily lives. They assist us in tasks from housecleaning to complex medical procedures. The integration of these technologies often goes unnoticed, yet the enormous growth potential of the sector cannot be overlooked.Industry predictions amplify the sentiment concerning market forecasts. According to Statista, the global robotics market is likely to reach a whopping $34.9 billion this year. By 2027, it projected to hit a total valuation of $43.3 billion. This dramatic growth reflects the escalating demand for smart, sophisticated robotic systems, effectively laying the foundation for expansive long-term growth.As we advance, the prevalence of robots in our daily lives is expected to surge, particularly as artificial intelligence technologies evolve.

It is an eminent portfolio holder of Private Education Loans and education loans insured or guaranteed under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (âFFELPâ). In fact, projected annual cash flows from private education loans and FFELP loans are $4 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively, in the next 20 years.NAVIâs in-school origination channel was enhanced when Earnest acquired Going Merry, a financial aid platform in September 2021. In 2017, NAVI had acquired Earnest, a financial technology and education-finance company serving consumers unable to get finance from traditional banks. It expects in-school loan origination volumes to be more than double in 2023 from 2022 levels.Apart from focus on revenue growth, Navient has been undertaking cost-control efforts to improve operating efficiency through data-driven approaches, simplification and automation. Over the years, the company has been witnessing a downtrend in expenses. The declining trend is likely to continue in the near term and aid NAVIâs bottom-line growth.Navientâs business-risk reduction and simplification efforts bode well. Transferring all its Department of Education (ED) servicing contracts to Maximus in October 2021, it eliminated an operationally-risky business and amplified its focus on domains outside government student-loan servicing.However, Navientâs top line is under pressure given its limited growth opportunities. After the transfer of ED servicing contract, it lost a major portion of its servicing revenues. Failure to acquire new loans, and develop and expand alternative sources to enhance declining revenues from FFELP loan portfolio is likely to affect its financials in the upcoming period.As of Mar 31, NAVIâs long-term borrowings of $57.39 billion exceeded its cash and cash equivalents of $570 million. Given such high debt burden, the company does not seem to be well positioned in terms of its liquidity profile.Also, an unfavorable debt/equity ratio and the payout rate compared with its industryâs average indicate that Navientâs capital deployment activities might not be sustainable in the long term.Further, the company is exposed to repricing risks related to its loans. Interest earned on FFELP loans are indexed to 1-month LIBOR rates and the private education loans are indexed either to 1-month LIBOR rates or 1-month Prime rate, whereas the cost of funds is primarily indexed to 3-month LIBOR rates. Relatively high interest rates are likely to lower Navientâs floor income, affect margins and reduce refinance loan origination volumes.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 6.6% against a gain of 1.2% recorded by its industry over the past six months.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFinance Stocks Worth ConsideringA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance sector are Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 75% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$3.0b. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 0.8% for shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell CSX which might hurt individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about CSX. Check out our latest analysis for CSX ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About CSX?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in CSX. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see CSX's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. CSX is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.8% and 6.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of CSXThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of CSX Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$173m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 24% stake in CSX. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for CSX  you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

Efforts to reward shareholders also bode well. However, headwinds like labor shortage, supply-chain disruptions and intermodal woes are hurting the stock.Letâs delve deep.Favorable FactorsCSXâs top line is benefiting from higher export coal volumes, domestic intermodal shipments, volume growth in other segments and pricing gains. Evidently, coal revenues increased 36% in 2022 driven by strength in export coal.Â  High export coal prices and fuel surcharge revenues are expected to bolster the top line in the near term.The merchandise unit is also expected to perform well. CSX projects revenue ton miles to grow in low-single digits in 2023 backed by strong performances in the merchandise and coal units.The companyâs commitment to reward shareholders is encouraging. In February 2023, CSX announced a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to 11cents per share. In 2022, it rewarded shareholders to the tune of $5,583 million through buybacks ($4,731 million) and dividends ($852 million).CSXâs cash and cash equivalents were $1,469 million at the end of first-quarter 2023, much higher than the current debt of $11 million, implying that the company has sufficient cash to meet its current debt obligations.Key RisksCSXâs operations are being hurt by supply-chain disruptions, including labor and equipment shortages. Revenues from the intermodal segment (internationally) are expected to be hurt in the near term due to headwinds like inflationary pressures.High costs due to increases in labor and fringe expenses, purchased services and other, and fuel expenses are limiting CSXâs bottom line. In 2021, total expenses rose 11% year over year due to 12%, 24% and 69% increases in labor and fringe expenses, purchased services and other, and fuel costs, respectively.In 2022, operating expenses increased 27% year over year, mainly due to 78% rise in fuel expenses. The hike in fuel costs was due to a steep rise in highway diesel fuel prices and the addition of non-locomotive fuel used for trucking.Story continuesCSXâs high capital expenditures may further impede its bottom line. During 2021, the companyâs capital expenditures were $1.79 billion, higher than $1.63 billion in 2020. In 2022, capital expenses were $2.1 billion.In 2023, capex is expected to be $2.3 billion. High capex may also hurt the company's free cash flow generating ability.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCSX currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the ZacksÂ TransportationÂ sector areÂ Copa HoldingsÂ CPA andÂ Allegiant Travel Company ALGT.Â While Copa sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Allegiant carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

216,f5484144-f2ef-387c-8149-65ad884f3965,ADI,2023-05-26,2 Long-Term Bets for Struggling Semiconductor Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-long-term-bets-struggling-173900677.html,1685036340,STORY,"['ADI', 'MCHP', '^GSPC']","[The strong demand environment of the last few months has allowed several semiconductor players to enter into long-term, preferred supplier or other special relationships with customers. This has improved visibility for players and stabilized revenue streams. However, the industry remains supply constrained, which is a limiting factor. Growth prospects over the next 5-10 years are excellent, because of the adoption of new technologies like AI-ML, EVs, smart cities, IoT, etc.Â While the longer-term outlook is extremely bright, near-term concerns related to the Fed-engineered economic slowdown and supply challenges remain. The most likely result will be increased caution at customers, who could order closer to consumption, thus reducing visibility. But this should not be a deterrent considering that there are segments of the market that remain amazingly resilient. While we wait for a suitable entry point, there are a few stocks that could be worth keeping an eye on.Â These would be stocks like Analog Devices and Microchip Technology.About the IndustryThe electronic gadgets we use to accurately read our commands, and record, store, retrieve and process the information we throw at them run on semiconductor technology, whether analog (enabling the recording and measurement of real-world information), digital (processing information available in machine-readable language) or mixed signal (enabling conversion of analog signals to digital or digital to analog among other things). Most electronic gadgets use a combination of these components, whether in consumer, industrial, auto, medical, communications, or IoT and other markets.The industry is cyclical and prices are elastic. Players usually serve multiple markets that offset their individual seasonality, or focus on certain core markets for which they have highly differentiated technology and relationships.Major ThemesThis is likely to be a mixed year for semiconductor companies offering analog and mixed signal chips. Some end markets will be sluggish. PCs (gradual uptick expected in the second half on the enterprise side and continued softness on the consumer side) and smartphones (weak consumer spending due to inflation affecting disposable income, as well as greater propensity to consume things like leisure and travel) stand out here. However, other markets like automotive, communications (especially 5G), IoT, cloud, AI, industrial (including medical devices) are all expected to do well. Technological innovation in the form of the metaverse, digital health, EVs and other innovative transportation and sustainability considerations are other drivers. China opening up is a positive, but uncertainties related to dealing with China remain.Story continuesThe industry is likely to see continued operating challenges. Primary among these is the supply/demand imbalance that is leading to an inventory glut especially in DRAM and NAND chips that have not been consumed as PC and smartphone demand slumped. Since analog/mixed signal chips are used in combination with these chips, this inventory imbalance is also affecting the market. Data center demand is on a secular rise although tempered in the short term by increasing costs, a slowing economy and sustainability concerns. On the other hand, the shortage of chips for the automotive market remains (as some OEMs cut back production because they have an inventory mismatch that they want to clear first). The second half may be expected to be better than the first, partly because of increasing capacity and partly because of other factors such as the end of support for Windows 10 leading to another upgrade cycle in the PC market.An emerging issue that semiconductor players are particularly exposed to is geopolitical tensions. The semiconductor supply chain is globally distributed, which means that international relations need to be maintained to ensure that work continues without disruption. While the Russia-Ukraine war didnât have that much of an impact, the souring of relations between the U.S. and China is another story. If China really tries to take control of Taiwan as many experts expect it will, there could be a terrible war that will be highly disruptive of the global economy and especially of the chip sector. Thatâs because a leading share of advanced node chips are made on the island. Another geopolitical concern is the increasing awareness among all leading nations of the increasingly larger role that semiconductors are playing in AI-driven electronic weaponry and surveillance mechanisms. As the importance of semiconductors in defense grows, the need to onshore or near-shore production is being felt. This is leading to rebalancing of the semiconductor supply chain not with a cost-reduction perspective but with a far more strategic objective. So the government is trying to incentivize companies to build in the U.S. TSM, the main supplier to the U.S. is setting up in the country but the plan is to have this on a much larger scale. The CHIPS Act may help a difficult situation where increased capacity would depress prices while U.S. production would increase costs. In the meantime, the U.S. has ordered restrictions on trading with China, which is also a near-term headwind for players.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Near-Term WeaknessThe Zacks Semiconductor â Analog and Mixed industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #188, which places it in the bottom 25% of the 250 odd Zacks-classified industries.The groupâs Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates weak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industryâs positioning in the bottom 50% of Zacks-ranked industries is based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions over the past year, we see that analyst opinion about the 2023 outlook remains down from a year ago although there has been some improvement in recent months. The outlook for 2024 has weakened. Overall, the 2023 estimates have dropped 2.9% over the past year, while 2024 estimates have dropped 7.4%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, letâs take a look at the industryâs recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Stock Market Performance GoodThe Semiconductor â Analog and Mixed industry has traded at a premium to both the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&amp;P 500 starting from November. The broader sector was trailing both between November and March, but continued to improve thereafter.Overall, the industry gained 7.5% over the past year while the broader sector gained 9.2% and the S&amp;P 500 2.8%.One-Year Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIndustry's Current ValuationThe industry's valuation is inexpensive. On the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, the industry is trading at a 16.94X multiple, which is a discount to both the S&amp;P 500âs 18.48X and the broader computer and technology sectorâs 23.70X. At the current level, it is however trading at a slight premium to its median level of 16.70X over the past year.The industry has traded between the 13.80X and 18.56X multiples over the past year.Forward 12 Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) RatioZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research2 Stocks to Hold for the Long-TermAnalog Devices, Inc. (ADI): Analog Devices is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits for industrial, consumer, communications and automotive customers. Other than manufacturing at its facilities in the U.S., Ireland and Southeast Asia, it also outsources some production to outside foundries, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for front-end processing and third-party subcontractors for back-end operations.Analog Devicesâ strength in the more resilient industrial (over 50% revenue share) and automotive markets is proving to be helpful in the difficult operating climate we are seeing today. However, as the economy softens further in the second half of the year, demand in these markets is expected to moderate. Edge computing (emerging applications include Industry 4.0, Smart Energy Systems, Electric Vehicles, Advanced Connectivity and Immersive Consumer) and ubiquitous connectivity are secular drivers however, as they are shifting ever-increasing amounts of data processing to the Intelligent Edge. The edge is where the semiconductor content per dollar of capex continues to increase, and that is where ADI is focused.As far as operations are concerned, the company has been growing output both internally and at its foundry partners, which has led to continued reduction in lead times. Bookings remain lower than sales, which increases the risk of the company missing guidance. But while this is bringing down the backlog, at the current levels the backlog still represents nearly a yearâs sales.Analog Devices beat April quarter estimates by 2.9%. In the last 30 days, the 2023 and 2024 estimates of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have been stable.The shares are up 6.7% over the past year.Price and Consensus: ADIZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchÂ Microchip Technology Incorporated (MCHP): Microchip Technology Incorporated operates in the Americas, Europe and Asia. It develops, manufactures and sells smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions such as general purpose 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers; 32-bit embedded microprocessors; and specialized microcontrollers for automotive, industrial, computing, communications, lighting, power supplies, motor control, human machine interface, security, wired connectivity and wireless connectivity applications.The near-term outlook for Microchip isnât great. With fears of a slowing economy looming, customers are looking to push out orders, which the company has been to help them with their inventory positions. This situation is expected to continue in the current quarter, with a corresponding negative impact on sales. Additionally, with such a sizeable backlog, new orders have slowed down, further deteriorating the outlook. However, since Microchip mainly produces at trailing edge facilities which have been in short supply in the last two years, management expects that there isnât a lot of inventory buildup at customers. At the same time, with supply constraints easing, its lead times continue to improve and the company intends to bring lead times down to 26 weeks by the end of the year.The long-term outlook is excellent however. More than 50% of its backlog is non-cancellable under its Preferred Supply Program (PSP), which is great for stability and visibility. Management has also been focused on total system solutions and higher growth megatrends, which has translated into increased design wins and share gains, positioning it for strong growth once the economic situation turns.Investors would also be interested to know that its strong cash flows have enabled the company to pay down a substantial portion of its debt over the last few years and also pay a consistent dividend. The company recently announced a 38.8% increase in the dividend with plans to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders by the March 2025 quarter.Microchip beat estimates by 0.7% in the last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 has increased 5 cents (0.8%) in the last 30 days. The 2024 estimate increased 17 cents (2.7%) during the same period.#2 ranked Microchipâs shares are up 8.2% over the past year.Price and Consensus: MCHPZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet, setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans.The tried-and-true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn't work today.For many years, bonds or other fixed-income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs. However, these yields have dwindled over time: 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6.50%, but today, that rate is a thing of the past, with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future.The impact of this rate decline is sizable: over 20 years, the difference in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is more than $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.Unfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?Invest in Dividend StocksAs we see it, dividend-paying stocks from generally low-risk, top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant low risk, low yielding Treasury and fixed-income alternatives.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesGoing beyond those familiar names, you can find excellent dividend-paying stocks by following a few guidelines. Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3%, with positive annual dividend growth. The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Cisco Systems (CSCO) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.39 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.22%. This compares to the Computer - Networking industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.81%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 2.7%. Check Cisco Systems (CSCO) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Perrigo (PRGO) is paying out a dividend of $0.27 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.32% compared to the Medical - Products industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 5% over the past year. Check Perrigo (PRGO) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.2 per share, Regions Financial (RF) has a dividend yield of 4.59%. This is compared to the Banks - Southeast industry's yield of 2.8% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 17.65%. Check Regions Financial (RF) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Yes, that's true. As a broad category, bonds carry less risk than stocks. However, the stocks we are talking about - dividend -paying stocks from high-quality companies - can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole.A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies, especially blue chip stocks, increase their dividends over time, helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're thinking, ""I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,"" make sure to do your homework. It's important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges.Bottom LineRegardless of whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, looking for a steady stream of income from dividend-paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have lost about 2.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Visa due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Visa's Q2 Earnings Beat Mark on Rising Payments VolumeVisa reported fiscal second-quarter 2023 earnings of $2.09 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 by 6.1% and our estimate of $1.92. The bottom line improved 17% year over year.Net revenues amounted to $7,985 million, which advanced 11% year over year in the quarter under review. The top line outpaced the consensus mark by 3% and our estimate of $7,596.9 million.The solid quarterly results benefited on the back of higher payments and cross-border volumes and processed transactions. Steady cross-border travel growth and lower-than-expected client incentives aided the results, partially offset by higher costs.Operational PerformanceVisaâs payments volume grew 10% year over year on a constant-dollar basis in the fiscal second quarter. Processed transactions (implying transactions processed by Visa) totaled 50.1 billion, which rose 12% year over year and beat our estimate of 49 billion.On a constant-dollar basis, the cross-border volume of Visa climbed 24% year over year in the quarter under review. Excluding transactions within Europe, its cross-border volume (that boosts a companyâs international transaction revenues) advanced 32% year over year on a constant-dollar basis.Service revenues improved 7% year over year to $3.8 billion during the March quarter on the back of better payment volume. The metric came higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $3.6 billion.Vâs data processing revenues of $3.8 billion grew 10% year over year in the quarter under review, meeting our estimate and beating the consensus mark of $3.7 billion.Story continuesInternational transaction revenues advanced 24% year over year to $2.7 billion, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.7% and our estimate of $2.5 billion on higher cross-border volume. Other revenues of $551 million climbed 16% year over year, which came lower than the consensus mark of $570.6 million but beat our estimate of $514.1 million.Client incentives (a contra-revenue item) of Visa escalated 18% year over year to $2.9 billion in the quarter under review. The metric amounted to 26.7% of Visaâs gross revenues of $10.9 billion.Total operating expensesof $2.6 billion increased 11% year over year, lower than our estimate of $2.7 billion. The increase was due to elevated personnel costs and professional fees. Non-GAAP operating expenses escalated 13% year over year. Interest expense came in at $142 million, up 3.6% year over year.Balance Sheet (as of Mar 31, 2023)Visa exited the March quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $13.8 billion, which dropped from the fiscal year-end level of $15.7 billion.Total assets of $86.8 billion increased from the 2022 fiscal year-end level of $85.5 billion.Vâs long-term debt amounted to $20.6 billion, which inched up from the fiscal year-end level of $20.2 billion.Total equity grew from the 2022 fiscal year-end level of $35.6 billion to $38.6 billion.Cash FlowsVisa generated net cash from operations of $8,031 million in the six months ended Mar 31, 2023, which increased from $7,721 million a year ago. Fiscal second quarter free cash flows of $3,650 million rose from $3,222 million a year ago.Capital Deployment UpdateVisa rewarded $3.2 billion to shareholders via share buybacks of $2.2 billion and dividends of $1 billion in the March quarter. V had authorized funds of $11.8 billion remaining under its share buyback program as of Mar 31, 2023.On Apr 25, 2023, management sanctioned a quarterly cash dividend of 45 cents per share, which will be paid out on Jun 1, 2023, to shareholders of record as of May 12, 2023.OutlookNet revenues are estimated to register low double-digit growth in the fiscal third quarter. Client incentives are expected to remain at the upper side of the 26.5%-27.5% of gross revenues band. Growth rate in domestic payments volume is expected to decline in the fiscal third quarter of 2023, while the strength seen in the international market will likely continue. The fiscal third quarter tax rate is expected within 19-19.5%.Non-GAAP operating expense growth is likely to witness a moderation throughout fiscal 2023. From the expense growth recorded in second-quarter fiscal 2023, the growth of expenses on a nominal dollar basis is anticipated to decline two or three points in the fiscal third quarter of 2023. The non-GAAP operating expense growth rate in the fiscal fourth quarter is likely to face a further reduction of two to three points.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresCurrently, Visa has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Visa has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerVisa belongs to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry. Another stock from the same industry, Equifax (EFX), has gained 4.6% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended March 2023.Equifax reported revenues of $1.3 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.5%. EPS of $1.43 for the same period compares with $2.22 a year ago.Equifax is expected to post earnings of $1.71 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -18.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.The overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Equifax.

Strong demand for Fios and fixed wireless products also led to the best total broadband quarterly performance in over a decade with total broadband net additions of 437,000.However, the Consumer wireless business struggled with 263,000 retail postpaid phone net losses in the quarter. This dragged the shares down in pre-market trading as investors probably expected healthy subscriber growth.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, net income in the quarter was $5,018 million or $1.17 per share compared with $4,711 million or $1.09 per share in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year increase despite top-line contraction was primarily attributable to high expenses in the year-ago quarter. Excluding non-recurring items, quarterly adjusted earnings per share were $1.20 compared with $1.35 in the prior-year quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.RevenuesQuarterly total operating revenues decreased to $32,912 million from $33,554 million in the prior year owing to lower wireless equipment revenues driven by a challenging macroeconomic environment. The lower year-over-year revenue was also attributable to the shutdown of the company's 3G network, resulting in the removal of approximately 1.1 million retail connections. The top line missed the consensus estimate of $33,709 million.Story continuesQuarterly Segment ResultsConsumer: Total revenues from this segment declined 1.7% year over year to $24,857 million, as higher service revenues were more than offset by lower equipment revenues in the quarter. Service revenues were up 1.8% to $18,456 million, while wireless equipment revenues slumped 9.2% to $4,878 million. Other revenues totaled $1,523 million, down 15% year over year.The segment recorded 263,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net losses and 351,000 wireless retail prepaid net losses in the quarter. Wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.05%, while retail postpaid phone churn was 0.84%. The company recorded 63,000 Fios Internet net additions as high demand for reliable fiber optic broadband was spurred by increasing work-from-home trend. Fixed wireless broadband net additions were 256,000 for the quarter. However, Verizon registered 74,000 Fios Video net losses in the quarter, reflecting the ongoing shift from traditional linear video to over-the-top offerings. The segmentâs operating income declined 3% to $7,099 million with a margin of 28.6%, down from 28.9% in the year-ago quarter. EBITDA decreased 1.6% to $10,313 million with a margin of 41.5% compared with 41.4% in the prior-year quarter due to higher marketing expenses.Business: The segment revenues were down 2.8% to $7,494 million due to lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues, partially offset by growth in wireless service revenue. The segment had 312,000 wireless retail postpaid net additions in the quarter, including 136,000 postpaid phone net additions. Wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.50%, while retail postpaid phone churn was 1.16%. Fixed wireless broadband net additions were 137,000 for the quarter. Operating income declined to $551 million from $673 million in the year-ago quarter with respective margins of 7.4% and 8.7%. EBITDA was down 5.1% to $1,645 million owing to higher subsidies for a margin of 22% compared with 22.5% in the year-earlier quarter.Other Quarterly DetailsTotal operating expenses decreased 1.7% year over year to $25,328 million, while operating income was down 2.7% to $7,584 million. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA declined to $11,902 million from $12,032 million for respective margins of 36.2% and 35.9%.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityVerizon generated $8,289 million of net cash from operating activities in the quarter compared with $6,821 million in the year-ago period. The improvement was primarily due to working capital improvements driven by lower inventory levels, fewer phone upgrades and a modest improvement in customer payment patterns. Free cash flow was $2,331 million compared with $1,000 million in the prior-year period. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had $2,234 million in cash and cash equivalents with $140,772 million of long-term debt. Capital expenditure totaled $5,958 million, up from $5,821 million in prior-year period, driven by expenses related to C-Band deployment. The continued build out of OneFiber and C-Band spectrum expansion will expand the reach and capacity of its 5G Ultra Wideband network across the country.Guidance ReiteratedVerizon has reiterated its guidance for 2023 and expects wireless service revenue growth in the range of 2.5%-4.5%. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be $47-$48.5 billion. The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $4.55 to $4.85 per share. Capital expenditure is estimated between $18.25 billion and $19.25 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresCurrently, Verizon has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Verizon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see some more stocks on the list, go directly toÂ Analysts are Upgrading These 5 Stocks.US stock markets are wavering as politicians continue their talks about the debt ceiling problem. The beginning of the week on May 22 saw a cautious tone in equity markets as President Joe Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy scheduled a meeting to address obstacles in the debt-ceiling negotiations. The discussions have been characterized by fluctuations between progress and deadlock, with time running out to reach an agreement. Stocks relinquished their gains on May 19 when Republicans temporarily withdrew from the talks. The urgency of the situation was emphasized on Sunday by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who expressed a low probability of the US being able to meet all its financial obligations by mid-June, reported Bloomberg.According to Bloomberg, oil prices stabilized in London on May 22 as financial markets remained uncertain while US lawmakers engaged in final negotiations to reach a resolution on the debt ceiling. Brent crude traded close to $75 per barrel, experiencing a decline of nearly 2% over the previous two sessions.Meanwhile, on the stock market front, financial services provider The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), luxury fashion holding company Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR), and technology company Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) recently came into the spotlight after receiving upgrades from analysts.Raymond James turned bullish on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), citing the tapering of client cash outflows at Schwab, which is expected to stabilize the company's balance sheet and net interest margin. On the other hand, Bernstein upgraded Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) after the company regained control over its inventory and strong demand for Coach products in China. Check out the complete article to see some other stocks recently upgraded by analysts.Story continuesAnalysts are Upgrading These 10 Stocks10. PlayAGS, Inc. (NYSE:AGS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23PlayAGS, Inc. (NYSE:AGS) designs and supplies gaming products and services for the gaming industry in the United States and internationally. On May 15, Jefferies analyst David Katz raised his rating on PlayAGS, Inc. (NYSE:AGS) from Hold to Buy and increased the price target from $7 to $10, citing the company's Q1 report. According to the analyst's research note, PlayAGS, Inc. (NYSE:AGS) has been experiencing a growing momentum in its products over the past few quarters, and this trend is expected to continue. The firm views PlayAGS, Inc. (NYSE:AGS) and its competitors as undervalued, presenting an opportunity for investors in a small-cap stock. Furthermore, the firm states that PlayAGS, Inc. (NYSE:AGS) operations have improved compared to the past three years, overcoming the challenges faced in 2019 and during the COVID-19 pandemic.09. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA) is a global pharmaceutical company that produces and distributes generic and specialty medicines and biopharmaceutical products in North America, Europe, Israel, and other parts of the world.On May 18, Umer Raffat, an analyst at Evercore ISI, upgraded Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA) from In Line to Outperform without providing a specific price target. According to the analyst, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA) has made significant progress in recent years, with a 50% reduction in net debt and resolving its opioid lawsuits. Furthermore, the company's core business has generally stabilized. Raffat points out that an intriguing opportunity has emerged for Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE:TEVA), as two branded programs are approaching important clinical milestones. Specifically, TL1A for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are expected to see key results next year. At the same time, long-acting olanzapine is anticipated to have a Phase 3 readout in the same timeframe. The analyst suggests that if either TL1A or long-acting olanzapine proves successful, the resulting upside would disproportionately benefit equity holders.08. Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR) is a travel services firm headquartered in Westlake, Texas. The firm operates a digital marketplace that enables cruise companies to list their tours and products and the general public to select the products they like. It has 16 different cruise lines on its platform.According to a research note issued on May 15, Bernstein upgraded Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR) rating from Underperform to Market Perform and set a price target of $3.50. The analyst acknowledges that the company still faces structural challenges but believes that a downside catalyst, in the form of a guidance cut, is now in the past. When initially covering Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR) earlier this year, Bernstein expressed concerns about the company's 2025 targets, considering them overly ambitious. However, according to Bernstein, the company subsequently implemented a cost-saving program of $200 million, which partially offset the impact of the guidance cut.07. Nevro Corp. (NYSE:NVRO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30Oppenheimer upgraded Nevro Corp. (NYSE:NVRO) rating from Perform to Outperform on May 15, setting a price target of $40. The firm highlights that the stock trades at a discount of 2 times its sales compared to the overall industry. Oppenheimer believes that if the new CEO can implement positive changes in the sales and marketing strategies, it could help stabilize the Nevro Corp. (NYSE:NVRO) market share and potentially exceed expectations, which would be favorable. Additionally, the firm suggests that any complementary acquisitions or introducing new products could present interesting growth opportunities akin to call options.06. AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE:AVB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE:AVB) is a real estate investment trust that owns and operates apartments in cities such as New York and Seattle. On May 15, AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE:AVB) was upgraded by BofA from Neutral to Buy, with a revised price target of $212, up from its previous target of $199. BofA is adjusting its ratings for residential real estate investment trusts (REITs). Demographic trends indicate that the market has reached or surpassed the peak demand for urban apartments. Considering AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE:AVB) portfolio, which is more focused on suburban properties, the firm believes that the REIT's strategic approach to its portfolio and development aligns well with the ongoing shift in demand, positioning it favorably to capitalize on this rotation.Here is what Baron Real Estate Fund has to say about AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE:AVB) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:âWe recently re-initiated a position inÂ AvalonBay Communities, Inc.Â The company is a REIT that owns and operates a $43 billion portfolio of high quality apartment assets, located primarily in the east and west coasts of the U.S. We believe its concentration in high-barrier-to-entry coastal markets and its mix of urban and suburban properties should lead to strong cash flow growth over time. AvalonBayâs investment grade rating provides it with a cost of debt advantage compared to private developers. Management has proven to be a capable acquirer and developer of apartment assets. We believe AvalonBayâs shares are trading at an attractive 25% discount to its private market value.âÂ Click to continue reading and see the Analysts are Upgrading These 5 Stocks.Â Suggested articles:15 Best Bank Stocks to Buy Now25 Largest Banks in the US by Asset Size10 Most Profitable Bank Stocks to Invest InDisclosure: None.

There is a realisation that inflation is going to be stickier for a lot longer,"" said Mike Hewson, chief markets strategist at CMC Markets.Further rate clues will be gleaned from U.S. personal consumption expenditure (PCE) data, often referred to as the Federal Reserve's favoured inflation gauge, due before the opening bell on Wall Street.The MSCI All Country stock index was up 0.2%, but heading for a 1.4% loss for the week. In Europe, the STOXX index of 600 companies was up 0.5%, but down about 2% over the week.On Wall Street stock index futures were were slightly firmer.

That for us is the red flag out there ... we've been using that to reduce our exposure to cyclical parts of the market and reduce risk in general,"" Osman said.CHINA RECOVERY QUESTIONEDIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.4% with revenue and production upgrades for U.S. chipmaker Nvidia boosting Japanese firms with exposure.Prices for Treasury bills maturing on the so-called X-date of June 1 recovered with hopes for a breakthrough, while the rest of the curve was under pressure as investors have also been worrying U.S. rates will go higher.The cost of insuring exposure to U.S. government debt dropped on Friday.Two-year U.S. yields hit a 2-1/2 month high of 4.552% in Asia on Friday, up 24 basis points on the week.

It was last at 7.0570 to the dollar as investors worried about the economic outlook.""The U.S. debt issues are not the only 'ceiling' that we are dealing with, as a slowdown in Chinese economic data suggests that a ceiling for growth may be forming as well,"" said RBC technical strategist George Davis.Growth bellwether copper hit a six-month low in Shanghai on Thursday and is down about 2.5% on the week.

This is often when a sexy investment thesis captivates Wall Street trading desks, sending the stock higher. Then retail investors get excited and buy without doing their fundamental homework.The bullishness feeds on itself. Until it doesn't.We've seen countless stock price bubbles over the past 20 plus years.There was the dot.com bubble when money-losing tech stocks such as Pets.com were artificially propped up on pure hype.We've had the cannabis stock price bubble of 2020 and early 2021 on hopes of federal legalization bringing big profits to money-losing pot upstarts like Tilray and Canopy Growth.There was the famous meme stock bubble at height of the pandemic that saw astronomic gains in GameStop, AMC, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and other fundamentally weak stocks, seemingly overnight.Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks this year have felt bubblicious many times, especially when you pick apart the fundamentals of the companies being hyped on trading desks, Twitter, and in chat rooms.Story continuesC3.ai came out last week and said it will lose about $68 million on an operating basis for the fiscal year ended April 30. Analysts expect the company to lose another $63 million for its new fiscal year.C3.ai has never turned a profit.Yet, the stock is up 160% this year. To this writer, that's too bubbly for my britches.At first glance, Nvidia checks a lot of bubble boxes:$200 billion-plus market cap gained in a single session simply because of a 2Q revenue outlook that was billions above estimates. Overlooked: sales, operating profits and net profits were all down year on year.Easy sellable story to novice investors. Here's the pitch: Nvidia's generative AI chips are being used by the likes of Meta and Microsoft-backed ChatGPT to change the world, so go buy Nvidia's stock.Nvidia's stock continues to fetch ever higher valuation multiples, taking them to new records based on future potential, which is just that â unknown future potential. Consider this: Nvidia's stock now trades at on a PE ratio of 112 times estimated earnings for the next 12-months. The broader stock market as measured by the S&amp;P 500 trades at 18.5 times or so.Those are large numbers on one large 2023 story stock.But unlike the bubbles mentioned here, Nvidia's ascent is a little different.For one, Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang has a strong track record of execution. Over the last six years, Nvidia has hauled in $40.3 billion in adjusted operating profits by my math. How has it done this? By being on the leading edge of chip design for big sectors such as gaming, autos, and data centers.Nvidia has made tangible stuff to accelerate the growth of really large companies, and has gotten handsomely paid to do so.Huang has stayed very measured as his company has burst onto the scene, based on what people who know him have told me through the years. I like that Huang isn't out there doing TV commercials, 10 earnings day interviews and appearing at 12 conferences a year. The guy remains head down on executing and only comes out when he has something worth sharing.That's real leadership.And that brings me to my final point.Nvidia is proving it will be on the leading edge of a real life generative AI movement. You may giggle that I have bought the hype, but I talk to enough CFOs to know they are allocating mega money to AI development.... and a lot of that money is being spent on powerful Nvidia chips.""So this is a very, very big deal [AI] that we can help the physical industry of the world become digital for the very first time,"" Huang told our Julie Hyman and Dan Howley on Yahoo Finance Live in March.Bubble characteristics on Nvidia? Sure. Will the stock company back to Earth? Sure. But to say Nvidia is another long-term stock bust is probably missing the point.""The AI Revolution is not hype as there will be massive winners such as Microsoft, Nvidia, and Google and also clear losers on the AI roadkill list,"" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told me via email.All in a day's investing analysis.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of todayâs research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Home Depot have underperformed the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry over the past year (-1.4% vs. +4.2%). The company has witnessed dismal performance in first-quarter fiscal 2023. Results were impacted by a more broad-based pressure across the business, driven by softened demand versus expectations. A deflation in lumber prices and unfavorable weather have also hurt the results. HD also provided a conservative view for fiscal 2023.Nevertheless, Home Depot has been witnessing significant benefits from the execution of the âOne Home Depotâ investment plan, which focuses on expanding supply chain facilities, technology investments and enhancement to the digital experience.The interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have helped consistently boost web traffic for the past few quarters. The company remains on track with its strategic investments to build a Pro ecosystem.(You can read the full research report on Home Depot here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Linde shares have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry over the past year (+12.5% vs. -3.2%).

The companyâs primary products in industrial gases include oxygen, which is used as life support in hospitals.Linde has long-term contracts with on-site customers backed by minimum purchase requirements, thereby securing stable cashflows. In the profitable industrial gas market, the merger of Praxair and Linde has created an efficient player with considerable size advantages.However, the cost of sales continues to increase, hurting the firmâs bottom line. Also, high leverage may limit its financial flexibility. The firm has mostly been paying a lower dividend yield than the industryâs composite stocks over the past two years.(You can read the full research report on Linde here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Walt Disney have outperformed the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry over the year-to-date period (+2.5% vs. +2.0%). The company is benefiting from growing popularity of Disney+, owing to a strong content portfolio and a cheaper bundle offering.Strong line-up of movies that include The Little Mermaid; Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny; The Boogeyman, Elemental and Haunted Mansion bodes well for the Media and Entertainment Distribution segment. Revival in Parks, Experiences and Products businesses is encouraging.Theme Park business is likely to gain from strong demand across both the domestic and international parks. However, Disney+âs profitability continues to be negatively impacted by higher programming and production costs across Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu.

This summer is jam full of big budget movies, ranging from family films to star-studded action flicks. This holiday weekend, Disney's live action ""Little Mermaid"" will be the big movie hitting theaters. Joining me now Shawn Robbins, Chief Analyst at Box Office Pro, as well as our very own, Allie Canal.Shawn, you know, it feels like every year, we're sort of ramping up to 2019 levels, but we're still well below theater attendance when we think about where things were in pre-pandemic times. Are these the names that are finally going to get people back?SHAWN ROBBINS: It's creeping ever so closer, it seems like. And, you know, I think this is the kind of week in the industry has really been looking forward to. ""The Little Mermaid"" is going to be a huge draw, especially I think for moms and daughters over the holiday. An audience that's really been underserved in recent months, recent years, to be honest.But at the same time, we have the second weekend of ""Fast X"". ""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3"" has done really well and had great word of mouth. That's a great variety of content to have on not just a big holiday weekend, but effectively the start of summer vacation for a lot of kids. And that's going to build into what looks like a really strong June and July slate as well.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And, Shawn, I want to pick up on that point because you wrote in your preview that driving optimism is the pent up demand for a female-driven tentpole. How important is it to have different genres and different types of movies rather than the same old Marvel, Avatar, superhero films that we seem to have gotten used to?SHAWN ROBBINS: It's priceless for the industry because, you know, look everybody loves their superheroes, but we want to see-- we want to see a variety of content. Like, if families go out to see ""Mario"", but at the same time adults go out to see ""John Wick"". That was the narrative. ""Creed III"" over the spring.Story continuesWe see more of that because that contributes to an overall healthy ecosphere for theaters, for studios, when everybody has something they feel like they want to go see, whether you're a young kid or maybe you're in your my age or older, my parents' age.And we have more of those movies this summer because everything from Marvel to ""Little Mermaid"" to ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Mission Impossible"", the spectrum is really covered.AKIKO FUJITA: You know, Shawn, we were talking about some of the movies coming out this summer-- the summer in our meeting today. And I can tell you, I had a bit of a flashback because it feels like, whether it's Transformers, you know, ""Little Mermaid"", ""Indiana Jones"", I mean, these are all names that we have heard before. Yes, they are in different iterations. But I mean, are we to the point where studios find them as safer bets here because it feels like there's a lot of remakes.SHAWN ROBBINS: It's true. And I think franchises have been the lifeblood of the box office for many years, even before the pandemic. It certainly trended in that direction. And that is the reality. They are the cash cows. They are the reliable brands. This is a risk-- a risk-averse industry. The studios want to invest in what they perceive as the easiest winners, even among winners that are not always easy to generate. And it's created, I think, a cry for more original content.I mentioned ""Oppenheimer"", that will be one of the few high profile examples of such original content this summer, even though it's based on a real person. But essentially it's original film. But at the same time, you know, I think we can still look to the positive side of a lot of these franchise movies have really been well made recently. Things like ""John Wick"" and ""Creed"" have been beloved by critics and audiences.So the upside, I guess, the glass half full aspect of this is, even though there is still a demand for more original content, maybe something like ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" last year, some of these bigger IP films and franchises are at least being treated with the care that I think audiences want to see, at least more often than not.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And, Shawn, we were just talking about MoviePass launching nationwide just in time for the summer box office season. What are your thoughts on the return of MoviePass? Could it make a difference domestically here at the box office?SHAWN ROBBINS: It's going to be fascinating to watch. I hesitate to make too many predictions just because it's been such an interesting journey over the last decade for that company. But I think it in broad terms speaks to what people are looking for. And subscription services have really become the name of the game for every household during the streaming age.To apply that to movie theaters and to already see exhibition chains with, such as AMC's a-list doing well. Regal has their own as well, over the last few years with similar restructurings. I think there's still an opening here for MoviePass and maybe even other competitors in the future. It's just about getting that model and making it and fine tuning it in a way that works not just for the company financially, but also for consumers from a practical standpoint.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And we have the Hollywood writers strike, it's ongoing. No end in sight at this point. Experts have said it likely won't impact the 2023 box office, but depending on how long this goes. 2024 could potentially be impacted. How much of a risk are you viewing a strike, especially since that production pipeline is so important to the box office?SHAWN ROBBINS: That's a great question, Allie. And it is something I think that is kind of a looming minor concern, but it becomes a bigger concern with each passing week that the strike goes on. And that's just kind of the reality of the industry. We have to look at the time tables, the lead time for productions on, especially major films. As you mentioned it shouldn't have much impact on 2023's releases.But as we look at 2024, which at the moment has a pretty strong slate up and down the calendar, some of those productions could be impacted or delayed. And we saw that happen about 15 years ago in 2007, 2008, when films like the first ""Transformers"" sequel was impacted and notably received poor reviews from audiences and critics in large part, as some creators went on to blame because they didn't have enough time to finish the script.So it's really tough to predict and say which ones will be impacted more than others. But it's something I think that the entire industry is going to have to look at over the next few weeks and the next few months.AKIKO FUJITA: So, Shawn, we've talked about the wide range of blockbusters that are set to be released. What's the one pick you have, your must see?SHAWN ROBBINS: My must see, that's a tough one. You know what, I'm personally-- I grew up a huge ""Indiana Jones"" fan. I grew up seeing the ""Mission Impossible"" movies when they first started coming out. I'm a huge Nolan fan. So really to me, there's like a four-week window in late June and early July when all three of those movies come out. For me, that's like the time on the calendar I think I'm most excited about this year.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Wait, Shawn, ""Barbie"" or ""Oppenheimer""? That's a real-- that's a real question for me.SHAWN ROBBINS: At the box office, I don't know. It's a coin flip. I think that's going to be such a fascinating weekend to watch. I think they both could do really well.AKIKO FUJITA: That's a diplomatic answer. It's Shawn Robbins, good to talk to you today. I appreciate the time. And, of course, our thanks to Allie Canal.]"

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase M&amp;T Bank's shares on or after the 31st of May, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 30th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.30 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$5.20 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that M&amp;T Bank has a trailing yield of 4.3% on the current share price of $121.09. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for M&amp;T Bank Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see M&amp;T Bank paying out a modest 38% of its earnings.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at M&amp;T Bank, with earnings per share up 9.0% on average over the last five years.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, M&amp;T Bank has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.4% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayIs M&amp;T Bank worth buying for its dividend? It has been growing its earnings per share somewhat in recent years, although it reinvests more than half its earnings in the business, which could suggest there are some growth projects that have not yet reached fruition. M&amp;T Bank ticks a lot of boxes for us from a dividend perspective, and we think these characteristics should mark the company as deserving of further attention.So while M&amp;T Bank looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. We've identified 2 warning signs with M&amp;T Bank (at least 1 which is a bit unpleasant), and understanding these should be part of your investment process.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

But the exchange had to pull out all the stops to lure chip designer Arm Ltd., likely to be the largest initial public offering of the year.Most Read from BloombergChina Is Drilling a 10,000-Meter-Deep Hole Into the EarthInside the Making of Redfall, Xboxâs Latest MisfireDebt-Limit Deal Passes the House, Easing US Default ConcernsWall Street Banks Are Using AI to Rewire the World of FinanceBillionaire Perot Warns of Real Estate Recession as Loans Dry UpThe proposed listing sparked a remarkable, behind-the-scenes scrum involving heads of state, exchange officials and the billionaire founder of SoftBank Group Corp., and was furiously contested across three continents for months. Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman and her team ultimately triumphed with a proposal that included a stunning $50 million joint marketing package and guidance on inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index, according to people familiar with the matter.She and her Nasdaq colleagues had to step up to fend off stiff competition from British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and supporters of a dual listing with the London Stock Exchange, as well as a surprisingly aggressive, last-ditch effort from New York Stock Exchange President Lynn Martin, the people said.Such heated interest in the semiconductor companyâs debut is a sign of growing interest in the technology â especially amid a shortage of strong IPOs. SoftBank, which owns Arm, is testing investor appetite for raising as much as $10 billion in the IPO, Bloomberg has reported.âIt helps Nasdaqâs image,â said Owen Lau, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. âThe IPO market has been pretty dreadful since last year. And people were looking for a catalyst, for a high profile deal that could jump start the market.âWhile Nasdaq is often considered the premier destination for tech debuts, the NYSE attracts many of the bigger IPOs from established companies. Of the 10 largest tech IPOs in the US over the last decade, seven of them went to the NYSE, including Uber Technologies Inc. and Snap Inc.Story continuesSoftBank has not publicly confirmed its choice of exchange, although it did disclose that Arm filed confidentially for a New York offering. SoftBank declined further comment for this story.A successful listing is critical to the future financial health of SoftBank, after an ill-fated dive into startup investing that led to billions in losses. This week, S&amp;P Global Ratings cut the companyâs credit rating a notch further into junk territory, saying a publicly traded Arm would help SoftBankâs balance sheet but the timing and valuation are still uncertain.SoftBank shares rose 1.1% in Tokyo on Friday.The path to Armâs IPO began after SoftBank abandoned a deal to sell the business to Nvidia Corp. in February 2022. In a conference call at the time, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son explained his backup plan was to take Arm public, and he responded to a question about where the listing would take place.âThe US, thatâs the market that we are looking at when it comes to listing Arm,â Son replied at the time. âAnd most likely Nasdaq.âIn the months that followed however, the Japanese billionaire retreated from that initial idea under repeated appeals from the UK, first from Prime Minister Boris Johnson and later Sunak. The current leader and his advisers argued that Arm, originally founded in Cambridge and previously listed on the LSE, would get an enthusiastic homecoming. They advocated a dual listing in London and New York.Son asked Arm Chief Executive Officer Rene Haas and Chief Financial Officer Jason Child to negotiate the best listing deal they could. They, in turn, enlisted Pat Healy, a consultant at The Issuer Network who specializes in advising companies planning IPOs, for support in negotiations with the exchanges.In the heart of the negotiations, Sunak and his team peppered Haas and Child with calls, and the SoftBank team grew increasingly serious about the twin listing, the people said. Sunak welcomed Haas to 10 Downing Street to discuss the matter in December and Son joined by video conference. Son was impressed by the prime ministerâs passion and detailed understanding of Armâs business, the people said.Sunakâs office declined to comment on any specific company discussions. The prime ministerâs transparency report shows he met with Arm and SoftBank that month.Senior staffers at SoftBank largely opposed the dual listing because of the additional costs and complexity, but they worried Son was susceptible to the charm and personal appeal of the British prime minister.Beyond money and support, SoftBank wanted multiple exemptions to list in London, including one involving related-party transactions. The LSE requires companies to get shareholder approval for any related-party transactions, but SoftBank sought an exception so it could simply disclose such transactions without explicit approval, the US standard. One concern was that SoftBank has investments in hundreds of tech companies and it didnât want to have to seek investor approval every time Arm wanted to do business with one of them.Rahm Emanuel, the US Ambassador to Japan, took the unusual step of getting involved to make the case for the US, as a counterbalance to the Sunak effort. The former mayor of Chicago, who also worked in the White House and in investment banking, met with Son and his lieutenants more than a dozen times, according to the people. Emanuel repeatedly relayed the view that Arm would be âpenalized, not rewardedâ for a joint listing on LSE.He worked with Friedman and Nasdaq staff on research to show that dual-listed stocks tend to underperform their peers over time. The report analyzed a group of more than 550 companies with valuations between $10 billion and $50 billion, drawing comparisons between stocks listed solely in the US, US ADRs with a foreign listing and US ADRs with a London listing. It concluded that stocks listed only in the US had 2.5 times greater trading volumes, about three times more liquidity and two times higher median price-to-equity valuation.âUS-listed peers have tighter spreads, higher valuation and greater liquidity than US American Depository Receipts with a foreign listing,â read the report produced for SoftBank, which was reviewed by Bloomberg. Plus, âthere are additional costs to consider,â such as producing financial statements under US and UK standards, stated the document.In February, Friedman flew to Tokyo and met with the SoftBank founder face to face to advocate for the exclusive Nasdaq listing.By March, SoftBank and Arm were leaning toward that outcome, in part because they couldnât get the related-party transaction exemption they sought. But they leveraged the competition from the UK to press for concessions from Friedman and her team, including lieutenants Nelson Griggs and Jeff Thomas. They were quick to secure the ARM ticker, which the NYSE had originally reserved, the people said.More complicated were the $50 million marketing budget and Nasdaq 100 issue, according to the people. SoftBank wanted more discretion over allocating the money to events it favored, and it wanted Nasdaqâs backing on certain criteria so the chip designer would have the best chance to be included in the index. A Nasdaq 100 listing is desirable because it draws support from many of the largest institutional investors.It was in early April, while Nasdaq and Arm were trying to resolve these last issues, that the New York Stock Exchange made its last-minute surprise appeal. The rival bourse came on strong with money and support, which âmade Arm hit pause,â according to one of the people. The NYSE declined to comment for this story.After more negotiations on detailed conditions, Friedman and her team agreed to the key terms raised by Haasâ team, the people said. Arm got more influence over how the $50 million marketing budget, which includes money and credits for certain events, would be applied, the people said. It also got reassurances the exchange would support Armâs efforts for Nasdaq 100 inclusion based on certain criteria. Nasdaq declined to comment.Friedman and the Nasdaq exchange made no promises about including Arm in the 100 index and any such decision would be made only on the merits, said another person close to the situation.The index, considered a global barometer for tech standouts like Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp., is reshuffled annually in December, with many companies seeking inclusion. The smallest companies in the index now are Sirius XM Holdings Inc., Lucid Group Inc. and Rivian Automotive Inc. Itâs unlikely Arm would be included in the Nasdaq 100 this December, but next year looks more likely based on the eventual timing of the listing, the people said.Andrew Bond of Rosenblatt Securities said the criteria for the Nasdaq 100 are defined in substantial detail so thereâs little room for concessions. Any firm would have to fall into one of the indexâs industry buckets, reach certain trading metrics, and its business would have to be a certain size. Arm âclearly fits the bill,â Bond said.In any case, snagging the Arm IPO is a significant victory for the exchange, he added.âIn an environment where we arenât seeing many IPOâs, this one matters,â he said. âHistorically, Nasdaq was looked at purely as a tech exchange for listings, and NYSE was the behemoth in the room with everything else of meaningful size.â--With assistance from Ellen Milligan and Dinesh Nair.(Updates with S&amp;P rating in eighth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Summer Camp Became Such a Hot Mess for ParentsHarvard MBA Grads Enter a Tepid Job Market Hoping for the BestGoldman CEO Loves Summer Camp So Much Heâs Expanded His PortfolioAssault Allegations Plague a $1.4 Billion Home Eldercare StartupCan Workplace Ketamine Retreats Improve Vibes in the Office?Â©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Shares have lost about 2.7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Juniper due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Juniper's Q1 Earnings Top Estimates on Solid RevenuesJuniper reported impressive first-quarter 2023 results, with the bottom and the top line beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Despite market uncertainties, the company witnessed a healthy revenue growth year over year. The upside can be attributed to significant growth in AI-Driven Enterprise solutions, Service Provider and Enterprise verticals. Easing of supply chain and elevated logistic and component costs also cushioned the top line to some extent.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, net income in the first quarter rose to $85.4 million or 26 cents per share from $55.7 million or 17 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. The 53% year-over-year improvement, despite higher operating expenses, was primarily propelled by top-line expansion.Non-GAAP net income was $156.6 million or 48 cents per share compared with respective figures of $101.6 million or 31 cents per share in the prior-year period. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents.RevenuesQuarterly revenues stood at $1,371.8 million, up from $1,168.2 million. Solid growth in Enterprise and Service Provider vertical boosted the top line. However, declining net sales in Cloud vertical partially reversed this positive trend. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,345 million.Product revenues were $912.6 million compared with $744.3 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Service revenues totaled $459.2 million, up 8% year over year owing to high sales of SaaS and software subscriptions.By vertical, Cloud revenues declined to $264.9 million from $307 million in the year-ago quarter. Many customers rescheduled the project timeline, which affected Cloud revenues in the quarter. Net sales from Service Provider climbed to $549.9 million from $428 million reported in the prior-year period. Improvement in Automated WAN Solutions and AI-Driven Enterprise supported the year-over-year gain from this vertical. Revenues from Enterprise were $557 million, up 29% year over year owing to net sales growth in all customer solutions. Rising demand for Juniperâs cloud-native AI-driven architecture supported the top line.By customer solution, Automated WAN solutions revenues amounted to $474.5 million, up 21% year over year. Net sales from AI-Driven Enterprise were $317 million, up 48% year over year. Revenues from Cloud-Ready data centers stood at $193.6 million, up 3% year over year.By region, revenues from Americas rose to $798.5 million from $655 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) increased to $369.9 million from $333.9 million in the prior-year quarter. In the Asia Pacific, net sales were up 13% year over year to $203.4 million. The improvement in Service Provider and Enterprise verticals propelled net sales growth in all the regions. However, a decline in Cloud partially hindered this trend.Story continuesOther DetailsGross profit totaled at $771.2 million compared with $649.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin were 57.8%, higher than midpoint of the guided range owing to net sales growth, favorable customer mix and an improvement in logistics and supply chain costs. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 14.8% from 11.8% reported in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses rose 10% year over year, primarily due to headcount related costs.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityIn first-quarter 2023, Juniper generated $191.5 million of cash from operating activities compared with $193.1 million in the prior-year period.As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had $923.5 million in cash and cash equivalents with $1,616.7 million of long-term debt.OutlookDespite some improvement, Juniper is still experiencing supply chain challenges and elevated logistics and component costs. The company is planning to work closely with suppliers to minimize the effects of these disruptions. Against the backdrop of macroeconomic challenges, management expects these issues will continue to affect a portion of JNPRâs portfolio through 2023.For the second quarter, the company approximates revenues of $1,410 million (+/- $50 million). Non-GAAP gross margin is estimated at 58% (+/- 1%). Management expects non-GAAP operating expenses to be $590 million (+/- $5 million). It anticipates the non-GAAP operating margin to be 16.2% at the mid-point of the revenue guidance. The non-GAAP tax rate is approximated at 19%. Assuming a share count of close to 328 million, non-GAAP net income is anticipated to be 54 cents per share (plus or minus 5 cents).For 2023, management expects sequential revenue growth with normal seasonal patterns. It expects to deliver 9% revenue growth for the full year. Non-GAAP gross margin is approximated at 58% in 2023.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended upward during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, Juniper has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a B. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

Disney currently owns two-thirds of Hulu with Comcastâs Universal controlling the rest. Under the terms of the joint ownership agreement, Comcast could require Disney to buy out its stake in the streamer as early as January 2024.Executives at both companies have voiced expectations that Comcast will sell to Disney â echoing similar reporting from The Journal, which said Comcast has stopped funding Hulu in anticipation of the sale.

Another major player in streaming is Hulu. According to the Wall Street Journal, the battle between Disney and Comcast for ownership is heating up. Hmm.This was a very interesting report from the Journal. And it really dove into the drama surrounding both Comcast and Disney that dates all the way back to the Fox acquisition. But what stood out to me in this piece in particular is the discrepancy over the valuation of Hulu. In 2021, according to this report, NBC Universal said that Hulu was worth roughly $70 billion, but that Disney had a valuation that was tens of billions of dollars less than that. So under the current agreement--Because it wants to buy the rest, so it's trying to get a bargain.Exactly. So to me, there's that intense of a discrepancy. That's going to be a problem down the line. Now in 2024, that's the deadline, January 2024, that's when will really determine. These estimates are from 2021. They're going to reassess in 2024. And if they can't reach some sort of an agreement, they're going to enlist a third party entity to come in and try and determine the true value of Hulu. Now under the current agreement, Hulu would be priced at a guaranteed minimum equity value of $27.5 billion. So that's the minimum.Comcast CEO, Brian Roberts, says, it's more than likely, it's going to sell for more than that. But again, both sides have to reach that agreement. So that was the most interesting part to me. So the battle for Hulu-- not quite over yet.No. It sounds like it's going to go on for quite a while. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.]"

(PRU): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-prudential-financial-130007758.html,1685019607,STORY,['PRU'],"[Prudential (PRU) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this financial services company have returned -5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, which Prudential falls in, has lost 2.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Prudential is expected to post earnings of $3.15 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +81%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.98 points to a change of +26.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.7%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.87 indicates a change of +7.4% from what Prudential is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Prudential.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PRU _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Prudential, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.53 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -9.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $54.22 billion and $54.08 billion estimates indicate -12.1% and -0.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPrudential reported revenues of $15.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.6%. EPS of $2.66 for the same period compares with $3.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.29 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +13.65%. The EPS surprise was -11.92%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Prudential is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Prudential. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The firm expects low to high single-digit losses to its total sales as a result of the ban, which prohibits critical information infrastructure operators in China from buying its products.Inspur, which is under US trade sanctions, and Lenovo are among the biggest buyers of Micron products, according to Bloomberg data.The ban also affects memory module makers and third-party suppliers.A Lenovo logo seen in Beijing.

The chip giant soaring on earnings and revenue guidance that blew past Wall Street expectations. At the core of the optimism is AI. Right now, Nvidia is the leader in the market for chips that power artificial intelligence. You're looking at the stock. They're up 25% right now on track for its best day since November of 2016.And Seana, for those who are sort of now looking at the same way, why all about Nvidia? We're talking about the GPUs. They're highly specialized chips that are really the building blocks for this latest advancement we have seen in AI over the last six months. I've been looking at some of these analysts calls on the stock, incredibly bullish. HSBC and Rosenblatt Securities most bullish for $600 a share.And there's a number of things that we've heard from analysts today that really point to this exuberance. Some would argue maybe a little irrational, but Truist upping its price target to $470 a share, calling the stock's upside ""stunning."" Susquehanna calling this a gold rush in AI, with NVIDIA selling the picks and shovels. And that's all contributing to this huge rally we're seeing today.SEANA SMITH: It certainly is, and we're talking about a stock that was already up over 100% ahead of the results, since the start of the year, ahead of the results that we got last night. So talk about some of the excitement that's playing out in the market. We're not only seeing this in Nvidia, yes, a massive gain there, but a number of stocks that do have exposure to AI are also riding this wave and this excitement here to the upside. We have AMD, Micron both having exposure to AI. They're in the green today. Google and Microsoft, when we talk about that ChatGPT or the generative AI exposure there, those two stocks moving to the upside. And Palantir and Arista Networks are also among the gainers today.Story continuesAkiko, you were talking about some of the analyst commentary that we're getting. A lot of this comes back to what we heard from NVIDIA when it comes to their guidance. And Bank of America was out with a note today, talking about the significance of that guidance raised. The company now expecting $11 billion in sales for the second quarter. But Bank of America in their note saying that they've never seen in their coverage anything like this, and that its market cap is on the path to 1 trillion, not too far from that today, and beyond.So certainly, a lot of hype here about what we've just heard from NVIDIA, but not just that-- really about what the company could potentially look like because of the developments in AI a few years down the road.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, and Seana, we can trace all the excitement around AI back to November of last year when we saw this release of ChatGPT. Investors, for months now, trying to figure out how to position themselves for what they see as transformational technology. There's an interesting study I want to point to here from NBER that talks about where the upside could be in AI. They specifically looked at the exposure a company's workforce has to AI and said, when you calculate that, the excess returns are 0.4% higher on a daily basis. You see IBM there at the top of the list, Nvidia rounding out the top five, but certainly, investors going to continue to seek for any kind of return on AI, as we see this hype grow more and more.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, look at those price targets. Certainly, a lot of excitement about what we heard last night about what we could potentially see here going forward.]"

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.It would be Wang's first face-to-face meeting with Raimondo since the latter took office in 2021. Wang last met Tai in Thailand in November at another Apec meeting.The meetings will be another attempt by the world's top two economies to re-engage after repeated stalemates as bilateral ties soured in recent years.The talks are expected to focus on trade issues after presidents Xi Jinping and Joe Biden agreed in Bali last November to improve communications on a wide range of issues including trade, according to Lu Xiang, an expert on US-China relations at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.""So, this time exchanges are likely to take place in pragmatic areas,"" he said. ""Such as reducing tariffs, which would be beneficial to the US itself foremost.""Since the bilateral relationship began to deteriorate in 2018 as the US-China trade war began, any improvement in ties would likely start in economic and trade areas, he added.In January, then Chinese vice-premier and head of China-US Comprehensive Economic Dialogue Liu He met US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in an icebreaking move in Davos, Switzerland.Story continuesBut the momentum was halted when an alleged Chinese spy balloon floated into US airspace in February. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken cancelled a planned visit to China as a result. Raimondo's trip to China in March was also postponed.""[Wang's meetings with Tai and Raimondo] are good first steps, but they will not change the downward trajectory of bilateral relations,"" said David M. Lampton, former president of the National Committee on US-China Relations and professor emeritus at Johns Hopkins SAIS, now at the SAIS Foreign Policy Institute.""What must change is the situation in which the two countries have mutually unacceptable national strategies,"" Lampton said.The tension between China and the US has extended beyond the trade war, but escalated into an all-around strategic competition especially in the area of hi-tech.The latest volley came as Beijing banned Micron Technology, the largest US memory chip maker, from selling its products to critical information infrastructure operators in China, citing ""severe national security risk"".""The relevant cybersecurity review is a necessary measure to safeguard China's national security,"" Shu said of the ban at a press conference on Thursday.""Enterprises from all countries and all kinds of products and services are welcomed to the Chinese market as long as they comply with the requirements of Chinese laws and regulations.""Lampton said the sanction on Micron was incompatible with improving investment and commercial relations, and fed the Western impulse to ""de-risk"" from China.""Similarly, a strategy of dislodging China from global supply chains breeds strategic distrust and encourages self-reliance thinking in China,"" he said.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. That's why when we briefly looked at United Parcel Service's (NYSE:UPS) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for United Parcel Service, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) Ã· (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = US$13b Ã· (US$72b - US$16b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, United Parcel Service has an ROCE of 23%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Logistics industry average of 15%. Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service roceIn the above chart we have measured United Parcel Service's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering United Parcel Service here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?In terms of United Parcel Service's history of ROCE, it's quite impressive. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 23% and the business has deployed 68% more capital into its operations. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIn short, we'd argue United Parcel Service has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 72% return if they held over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing United Parcel Service that you might find interesting.United Parcel Service is not the only stock earning high returns.

(NYSE: FDX). FedEx was ahead of UPS in part to try to attract shippers concerned about a possible work stoppage.âUPS is a lot more willing to roll out aggressive pricing,â Dunham said in an interview.UPSâ stance is a far cry from a couple of years ago, when with demand soaring the carrier had little incentive to work with its shippers on pricing. Carrier reps would balk at any contract changes and in some cases push contracts on customers with a take-it-or-leave-it posture, Dunham said.The current five-year national UPS-Teamsters contract expires July 31, and union leaders have warned that the 340,000 or so UPS members will walk off their jobs on Aug. 1 without an agreement. Talks are underway in Washington to hammer out a new agreement.âThereâs obviously a lot of fear out there,â said Dunham, referring in part to Reveelâs 700 shipper customers. âThey are hoping a deal gets reached by the end of June.âStill, there isnât a wholesale rush to find contingency services, said Dunham, who pointed out some traffic has migrated to FedEx, while the U.S. Postal Service has been identified as a possible source.âThe answer is no as far as whether the response contains direct action,â Dunham said. âIt is more about what is going on at the planning stage,â he said.UPS and the Teamsters, meanwhile, need to be concerned about the state of the economy that brackets their negotiations. In a Reveel analysis of package count from the first quarter of 2022 throughthe first quarter of 2023, volumes had dropped 10.1% year on year. That is far higher than Dunham had expected. Reveelâs clients represent a variety of parcel spend levels.Story continuesAnother factor is the increasing comfort that shippers have with using multicarrier platforms, with which alternatives are available at the click of a mouse. âBefore the pandemic, you had two choices: FedEx and UPS. Thatâs changed,â Dunham said.Today, shippers view these platforms almost as necessities, he added.The post Good time to rework UPS contracts, consultant says appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Capital expenditures came in at $609 million. Free cash flow was $1,770 million.Segmental DetailsU.S. Domestic Package revenues decreased 0.9% year over year to $14,987 million in the first quarter, driven by a 5.4% decrease in average daily volume, nearly offset by a 4.8% increase in revenue per piece. Segmental operating profit (adjusted) fell 12.7% year over year to $1,488 million in the quarter. The adjusted operating margin for the segment was 9.9% in the first quarter.Revenues at the International Package division summed $4,543 million, down 6.8% year over year. The downfall was due to a 6.2% reduction in average daily volume due to lower domestic volume and softness in Chinaâs trade lanes. Segmental operating profit (adjusted) totaled $806 million in the reported quarter, down 28% year over year. The adjusted operating margin for the segment was 17.7% in the first quarter.Supply Chain and Freight revenues of $3,395 million fell 22.5% year over year due to market rate and volume declines in forwarding, partially offset by growth in UPSâ healthcare business. Operating profit (on an adjusted basis) fell 46.4% to $258 million in the first quarter. The adjusted operating margin for the segment was 7.6% in the first quarter.Story continues2023 OutlookUPS now anticipates revenues to be around $97 billion (prior view: $97-$99.4 billion).

We'll take a look at small business. Small business confidence dropped in April to 89, the lowest level in more than 10 years, according to the NFIB. Owner pessimism driven by a looming recession and worker shortages. Now, American Express took a deeper dive with its first ever small business financial confidence report. For better understanding that broader influences weighing on smaller shops, I'm joined now by Anna Marrs, Group President of Global Commercial Services and Credit Fraud Risk at American Express alongside Yahoo Finance's own Diane King Hall in a Yahoo Finance exclusive interview. Thank you so much for joining us this morning.ANNA MARRS: It's great to be here.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Congratulations on this report. Of course, thank you. So talk about this deeper dive that we get from Amex's new report versus what we would get from the NFIB.ANNA MARRS: OK, absolutely. Well, we all small businesses are important, right? They provide about half of all the jobs in the US economy. And we see small businesses today as navigating kind of twin peaks. On the one hand, they're recovering from a pandemic, from supply chain issues. And on the other hand, they're preparing for a more uncertain macro environment. And so what we found in the first American Express small business financial confidence report is a lack of financial confidence in small businesses. So we found that around 50% of small businesses feel truly confident when taking financial decisions. And that number falls even lower to the smallest of small businesses. Only 29% feel financially confident.And this has a real impact. In fact, 40% of the businesses in the study said that they didn't take growth opportunities on the back of a lack of financial confidence.Story continuesDIANE KING HALL: So one of the things that may not have been pulled out in this, but it's top of mind right now, does it come up when you're talking to small businesses about the debt ceiling? Are they worried about the debt ceiling?ANNA MARRS: Well, it's certainly in the news. We all see it in the news. You know, American Express, we don't employ economists, but we all look at these reports and this-- the news that's underway. There's no doubt that a shutdown of the US government would be another shock on the US economy, and it's yet another thing for small businesses to have to navigate. And so absolutely, it would play into something like the optimism report that Rochelle talked about at the start of the segment.DIANE KING HALL: Right.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And, Anna, obviously, we're in an environment you have high inflation, but you also have tighter lending conditions that stem from some of the banking fallout. How are some of these smaller businesses managing cash flow?ANNA MARRS: It's directly related. You know, small businesses, cash flow is the perennial problem. It's actually through the world over. Understanding the money that's coming in, the money that's going out contributes to their lack of confidence. And when credit gets tight, clearly cash flow gets tight. And so at American Express, that's been a big focus of us. How do we get small businesses to have more transparency into their cash flow? We actually created a whole digital hub called the Business Blueprint. Small business, any small business can go on, get a login, link in their bank accounts, and see their cash flow.So what's coming in, what's going out. They can access an easy to access line of credit if they want to augment their financial position and really make sure they do have that confidence to take those growth opportunities, which will help grow our economy, as well as their business and give them what they need to thrive.DIANE KING HALL: And I want to ask you about jobs in particular, because as you mentioned, small businesses account for a great chunk of the job market, and the job market has been very resilient in recent months, especially as we see these-- the jobs reports. What are small businesses saying about staffing, and what their needs are, and how they're able to even meet those needs?ANNA MARRS: They absolutely say it's still a pain point. In fact, half of the small businesses in this report say they're struggling to get the staff that they need. They say they're hiring and they struggle to get the staff that they need. And about a quarter of small businesses say it's a major issue for them. And absolutely, it's another area of uncertainty. When you think about taking on those big projects, am I going to have the staff that I need to capture those growth opportunities? So it's absolutely a pain point.DIANE KING HALL: OK.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And, Anna, building on that because we know that AI is the buzzword that, you know, we're seeing it on the markets everywhere. If you're a small business and you're looking at this-- as we look at how they're planning to deploy it, you saw in the study, saving time, data security, customer service. What sort of support though do they need to actually bring that to fruition, and as we mentioned, to have the skilled workforce to be able to provide these services?ANNA MARRS: Yeah. We would describe these findings in this report as small businesses are at least AI curious. I'd say that's how we'd describe it. 40% say they're already using AI in some way in their business. And I have to say that really surprised me. But then when we dug into it and what they're using AI for and what they're excited about, it's actually a very typical with an entrepreneur's profile. So the number one use case they want to deploy is finding more customers. That's always the first thing a small business wants to do. So think marketing, thinking ad optimization. Then they want to use AI to better service their customers. So make it easier for customers to find what they need and do more business with them.And what I found was really interesting is many small businesses saw AI as possibly leveling the playing field. They see many of these tools as being much more widely available. So they say, hey, maybe AI is going to help me compete better with the big guys.DIANE KING HALL: Let's-- speaking of that, let's go back to like staffing. Do-- did any of the small businesses talk about-- because we've had conversations-- many conversations about AI and robots, do they expect to employ more automation in that respect and using literal robots to do some of the work that they need?ANNA MARRS: You know, there was a really funny comment from a small business owner who talked about the next generation. So he has a kids who are in the business. He's hoping that AI helps make his kids smarter and maybe make up for the fact that they don't work as hard as he does. But he hadn't gotten fully to robots yet. He was looking for a way to enhance his staff base, which included his family members. I think the fact that small businesses are hiring, are struggling to hire what they need, they're no way in robot yet. They start with the customer always, and that's where they're focused on deploying AI.DIANE KING HALL: All right.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, apart from you sort of banking on our kids to be the next generation to fix all of this for us, I do want to ask you, when you talk to some of these small business owners, what do they see as the top barriers to really growing their businesses right now?ANNA MARRS: Well, small businesses are always focused on getting more customers. You know, I was looking back at this thing we have at American Express called small Shop Small or Small business Saturday. Hopefully, you'll see the ads over the summer. You'll get out there and shop in the small businesses around the corner. That's a program that we launched in 2010. So really in the middle of that recession that you are showing earlier, because small businesses always have this long-term need to grow their customer base. Then we talk about cash flow in an uncertain environment, that pain point clearly gets, you know, more acute and really making sure that small businesses have those tools. Even in a tighter credit environment, it's really critical, flexible, easy to access, line of credit products.Of course, we also have a series of small business cards that many business owners use to run their business. And that's where we're going to stay focused to navigate whatever's ahead.RACHELLE AKUFFO: We do thank you for joining us this morning. Anna Marrs there, American Express Group President of Global Commercial Services and Credit Fraud Risk and Yahoo Finance's Diane King Hall. Great conversation. Thank you for joining us.ANNA MARRS: Thank you.]"

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.54 billion, suggesting a decline of 8.1% year over year.NTAP beat estimates in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9%, on average.NetApp, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNetApp, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNetApp, Inc. price-eps-surprise | NetApp, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteWeakness in global macroeconomic conditions, softening IT spending environment and cloud cost optimization efforts by clients are likely to have affected NetAppâs performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Increased budget scrutiny by clients, leading to smaller deal sizes and extended selling cycles, is likely to have acted as a dampener.Also, unfavorable forex movements, lingering supply-chain troubles, increases in freight and logistical expenses, and higher component costs are expected to have acted as headwinds.Nonetheless, NTAPâs extensive cost control measures, and lowering investment policy in products with relatively lesser revenue potential like SolidFire and Astra Data Store are likely to help it navigate the current challenges.The company is also focusing on its Hybrid Cloud business. The launch of the new cost effective AFF C-Series, which is QLC-based all-flash arrays that cover a wide array of workloads, bodes well. This solution is expected to aid customers navigate a highly cost-sensitive environment.NetAppâs strengthening go-to-market activities, various cloud collaborations and continued product innovation amid an accelerating digital transformation remain major positives. Healthy adoption of new product launches like NetApp BlueXP augurs well. NetApp BlueXP is a unified control plane that provides hybrid multi-cloud experience for data and storage services.Renewed momentum in Spot by NetApp portfolio might have aided the Public Cloud Services business. Strong demand for other cloud solutions like Azure NetApp files, Cloud Volumes and Cloud Insights services is likely to have benefited the company in the quarter under review. Spot by NetApp enables enterprises to make multi-cloud management easier and lower expenses at the same time.Synergies from the buyouts of CloudCheckr and Data Mechanics bode well. NetAppâs other buyouts include Fylamynt and Instaclustr.For fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hybrid Cloud segmentâs revenues is pegged at $1.4 billion.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Public Cloud Services revenues is pegged at $152 million.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NetApp this time around.

She firmly mentioned that a default would invariably push the U.S. economy into a recession.The government wonât be able to fund defense operations and medical requirements if the debt-ceiling crisis drags on. The cost of borrowing would go up, and consumersâ propensity to spend would get impacted.Americans may lose their jobs, leading to credit agencies downgrading the economy. Investors, eventually, would be compelled to sell the U.S. treasury bonds leading to a weaker dollar and a lot of volatility in the stock market.Talking about markets, Wall Streetâs major bourses finished lower on May 24, with most of the S&amp;P 500 sectors ending in the red. In reality, Wall Streetâs fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, continues to hover around a three-week high as the debt-ceiling impasse dents investorsâ sentiment.However, from an investment standpoint, thereâs no reason to panic! Investors should now buy low-beta, dividend-paying stocks like Kraft Heinz Company KHC, Conagra Brands CAG, and NiSource NI that remain unperturbed by gyrations in the market, thanks to their solid business models. Low beta, by the way, ranges from 0 to 1.Story continuesIn unison, these stocks do well during economic downturns. These are defensive stocks belonging to the consumer staples and utilities sectors.

296,f212dfb3-fae0-3856-a1db-5ff12183f5d5,ZBH,2023-05-26,Here's Why You Should Retain Bruker (BRKR) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-bruker-brkr-152100213.html,1685028060,STORY,"['BRKR', 'HOLX', 'ZBH']","[Bruker Corporation BRKR is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by the strength of its BioSpin Group and CALID businesses. The companyâs recently released 2023 first-quarter results along with raised guidance for the full year, are also encouraging. However, Bruker is not well capitalized in terms of solvency, which is concerning.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has risen 21.2% compared with 4.9% upside of the industry and a 3.3% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $10.73 billion. Bruker projects a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 18.2% compared with 13% of the industry. BRKRâs earnings surpassed estimates in allÂ  the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an average surprise of 10.9%.Letâs delve deeper.UpsidesImpressive Q1 Results: Bruker ended the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The top line reflects a robust performance across all its operating segments and geographies, backed by continued demand for the companyâs differentiated scientific instruments and life-science solutions. The expansion of the gross margin is an upside. The companyâs adjusted operating margin benefited from Project Accelerate 2.0âs high-growth and high-margin initiatives, particularly in proteomics and spatial biology.Meanwhile, the company raised its outlook for 2023 revenues and adjusted EPS. This factors into the quarterâs performance and strength in bookings and backlog, generating investorsâ optimism.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStrong Prospects for BioSpin: It is encouraging to see robust growth in revenues across Brukerâs BioSpin Group portfolio in the first quarter, including NMR and MRI preclinical imaging. Notably, the company received two orders from the United Kingdom for 1.2 gigahertz NMRs. Both will be used for structural and functional biology and life-science research and GreenTech and materials research as well.Story continuesCALID Group Holds Potential: Brukerâs CALID Group revenues increased 16.5% year over year in the first quarter. Organic revenues were supported by strong life science mass spectrometry and vibrational spectroscopy businesses.The timsTOF platform continued its adoption in 4D proteomics, epiproteomics and multiomics. The company had excellent year-over-year growth in bookings and announced further key enhancements to advance capabilities.DownsidesWeak Solvency: Bruker exited the first quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $598 million compared with $646 million at the end of 2022. Â However, the reported quarterâs total debt of $1.23 billion was much higher than the corresponding cash and cash equivalents level. This indicates a tough solvency position.Exposure to Currency Movements: Bruker conducts 80% of its business in international markets. As a result, currency fluctuations continue to result in foreign currency transaction losses at the company. In addition, currency fluctuations could cause the price of Brukerâs products to be less competitive than its principal competitors' offerings.Estimate TrendBruker has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023.

NearlyÂ 18% of the U.S. GDPÂ went toward healthcare in 2021, which will only continue growing as the populationÂ gets older and sicker. This structural trend should be a rising tide that lifts all boats and will likely play out globally.But which are the best healthcare stocks to buy? There are plenty to choose from. The sector has various players, including insurers, device makers, and pharmaceutical giants. Thereâs also a new and growing market for virtual doctors. Artificial Intelligence also has an iron in the fireâ from training new surgeons to removing human error from the diagnosis process.There are some important considerations for long-term investors looking to ride the healthcare wave for the next decade or so. The first is stability. Sure, the prospect of AI in the operating room sounds coolâ but weâre still pretty far off from becoming a true profit driver. Companies with large, diversified businesses within the healthcare arena make for good picks. Many of these companies also pay dividends and have a solid track record of rewarding investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDividends arenât bad, but itâs important to watch how much money these companies are investing in growth. If a company sends all of its excess cash back to investors, that tells you that investing in new growth for the business isnât expected to generate great returns. So itâs important to find companies that can strike a healthy balance.Healthcare Stocks: Zimmer Biomet (ZBH)stethoscope on a stock chart representing healthcare stocks to buySource: ShutterstockZimmer BiometâsÂ (NYSE:ZBH) bread and butter is a large-joint reconstruction. Itâs a top player in the hip and knee replacement market, and its strategy is to expand its suite of offerings toÂ capitalize on that position. This should offer a host of cost savings and synergies to boost margins. The groupâs been working to streamline its operations as it gobbles up smaller competitors through strategic acquisitions.Â First quarter resultsÂ suggested the strategy is a winning one, with revenue growth across all categories underpinning improved guidance.Story continuesZimmer does have some challenges ahead. The industry is shifting from a model where surgeons were primary decision makers to one where purchasing is made at the hospital level. Healthcare reform means hospitals will be looking to trim their costs, and that could impact Zimmerâs ability to muscle into new markets. Safety will be a key differentiator, so the groupâs quality control must be flawless moving forward.For now, Zimmer looks to be in a strong position to maneuver as the industry develops, and its growth strategy looks promising.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comUnitedHealth GroupÂ (NYSE:UNH) has a stronghold on the US health insurance market, and its sprawling size makes it an excellent pick for long-term investors in healthcare stocks. While history doesnât necessarily tell us anything about the future, itâs promising to know that the group has aÂ long track recordÂ ofÂ delivering revenue growth.UNH has two segments. UnitedHealthcare is its largest, providing healthcare benefits to individuals and employers. Senior benefit offerings have been bolstering revenue here lately, and itâs been able to win new Medicaid contracts in new markets, which will continue fuelling growth.But itâs Optimum, UNHâs other sector, where the most exciting growth prospects lie. This part of the business manages benefits and uses IT to streamline healthcare plans. This part of the business recently took the LHC group under its umbrella, a business geared toward chronically ill patients.UNH has plenty of room to grow, and managementâs been allocating a fair amount of spend to those prospects. But the group also pays a dividend, albeit a modest one yielding under 2%.Pfizer (PFE)blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stockSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comPfizerÂ (NYSE:PFE) was one of the healthcare stocks that skyrocketed after the Covid pandemic thanks to its involvement in creating a vaccination. But now that the population isnât storming in to get vaccinated, the stock has fallen somewhat out of favor. That offers a buying opportunity for long-term investors.While some of its peers look to buy back stock now that their valuations have returned to earth, Pfizerâs investedÂ in its pipeline, and pipelines are the be-all-end-all for pharmaceutical stocks. Drugmakers must constantly come out with new treatments or new uses for existing treatments to protect their margins. Once their treatments have passed a certain period, generic medicines can enter the market, making a once-strong revenue stream a lot less so.On top of that, Pfizer hopes to squeeze a little more out of its Covid vaccine, with a combined covid and flu vaccine expected to hit the market in 2026. While the same volume of people may not be getting the jab, Pfizer will beÂ able to charge moreÂ since government intervention will no longer keep a lid on prices.On the date of publication, Marie Brodbeck did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

In addition, a late-breaking abstract showed treating central sleep apnea (CSA) caused a âsignificant and clinically relevant improvementâ in their symptoms and quality of life. The studies were among 24 supported by ResMed (NYSE: RMD, ASX: RMD).Treating OSA with PAP lowered all-cause mortality in France, GermanyTwo headline studies presented at ATS showed an association between PAP treatment for OSA and lower all-cause mortality. One is an analysis of over 22,000 anonymized German patients diagnosed with OSA â roughly half using PAP, the other not. The study, led and presented by German sleep researcher Holger Woehrle, concluded PAP treatment for OSA is associated with a 13% lower mortality in the first four years of treatment.The other is an analysis of over 100,000 deidentified French patients who previously stopped but restarted PAP to treat OSA â roughly two-thirds were still using PAP one year later, the other one-third stopped a second time. The study, led and presented by French sleep researcher Jean-Louis PÃ©pin and part of ResMedâs broader landmark ALASKA study, found âthe risk of all-cause death was 38% lower in individuals who continued using CPAP after therapy resumption.âThese studies build on a 2022 ResMed ALASKA study published in CHEST that found people with OSA who continued PAP over a three-year period were 39% more likely to survive than those who didnât.Story continuesTreating CSA with ASV improved quality of life, symptoms over 1 yearA third major finding came out of READ-ASV, the largest prospective registry investigating the clinical use and effects of adaptive-servo ventilation (ASV) in a real-world cohort with central sleep apnea. Led and presented by German sleep researcher Michael Arzt, this prospective, multicenter, and multinational study of 847 patients concluded that first-time ASV users with central sleep apnea âexperienced a significant and clinically relevant improvement in disease-specific quality of life, daytime sleepiness, and quality of sleep.â*âCombined, these studies by globally renowned researchers emphasize not only the effectiveness of PAP and specifically ASV therapy for patients who need them, but how better sleep and breathing is vitally connected to our overall health,â said Carlos M. Nunez, M.D., ResMed Chief Medical Officer.An estimated 936 million people worldwide have obstructive sleep apnea,1 a chronic disease in which throat muscles relax during sleep, constricting airflow. As a result, the body jolts to awaken and take a breath, causing dozens to hundreds of sleep interruptions per night. An estimated 5â10% of all people with sleep-disordered breathing have central sleep apnea,2 wherein the brain stops sending signals to the bodyâs breathing muscles during sleep, resulting in similar symptoms. All sleep apnea sufferers often arenât aware of these waking episodes, and 80% remain undiagnosed.3About ResMed At ResMed (NYSE: RMD, ASX: RMD) we pioneer innovative solutions that treat and keep people out of the hospital, empowering them to live healthier, higher-quality lives.

ATR is well-poised to gain from demand in its end markets and efforts to expand its business through acquisitions and investment in capacity expansion. Backed by efforts to bring new and innovative products into the market, it remains the preferred choice for renowned brands worldwide which will continue to aid growth.Letâs delve deeper and analyze the factors that make this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock a compelling investment option at the moment.Better-Than-Expected Q1 Results: ATRâs first-quarter 2023 total revenues rose 1.8% year over year to $860 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $844 million. Core sales, excluding currency and acquisition effects, improved 4% year over year aided by the Pharma and Beauty segments. Adjusted earnings per share were 95 cents, beating the consensus estimate of 90 cents and increasing 2% year over year.Positive Earnings Surprise History: AptarGroup has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.4%.Upbeat Growth Projections: An uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the companyâs earnings echoes a positive sentiment. The estimate for 2023 earnings has moved 8% upward over the past 30 days and is pegged at $4.15 per share. It suggests growth of 9.5% from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for fiscal 2024 earnings has also gone up 5% over the past 30 days and stands at $4.57 per share. It indicates a year-over-year improvement of 10%.ATR has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 7%.Segments Well-Poised for GrowthThe Beauty segment is seeing higher sales in both prestige and mass fragrance, along with sales growth of skin care and color cosmetic solutions. The company is investing in building a new state-of-the-art Prestige Custom beauty plant in Oyo, France, which will be operational in the ongoing quarter.The Pharma segment is witnessing healthy demand for its proprietary dispensing devices used for nasal decongestants, eye care, cough and cold and saline rinses, as well as allergic rhinitis, emergency medicines and depression therapies. Demand for elastomeric components remains strong, including for biologics. To capitalize on this momentum, AptarGroup is expanding its capacity to produce elastomer components for injected medicines and active material science solutions. Also, the FDA approved Narcan for over-the-counter usage recently which is expected to boost the segmentâs growth.Story continuesStrong Balance Sheet Enables Investment in BusinessATR maintains a strong balance sheet, which enables it to continue to invest in a business and pursue strategic opportunities while continuing to return value to shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases. In the first quarter of 2023, the company spent $78 million on capital expenditures, the majority of which were in the Pharma segment, including expansions in the United States, France and China. For 2023, the company intends to spend $280-$300 million in capital expenditures. This reflects the additional accelerated investments that AptarGroup will make to increase production capacity for proprietary pharma dispensing devices to meet the rapidly growing demand.Acquisitions: A Key Growth StrategyAptarGroup continues to expand its business through acquisitions to expand the scope of technologies, geographic presence and product offerings. In 2022, it acquired Metaphase Design Group Inc., an expert in the ergonomic and industrial design of handheld devices, including medical devices, which is now a part of the Pharma segment.In March 2023, AptarGroup completed the acquisition of France-based iD SCENT, which is considered an expert in paper fragrance sampling solutions. The company also completed the acquisition of 80% of the equity interest of Bahrain-based Gulf Closures W.L.L., which manufactures closures for beverage products.Customers Favor ATRâs Innovative SolutionsAptarGroup continues to introduce innovative products and has thus been the packaging solution partner for renowned brands in pharma, beauty, personal care and home care markets. Its nasal spray pumps have been featured on a growing number of allergy medications, with notable new launches recently in Latin America and Europe. The proprietary ophthalmic squeeze dispenser continues to drive growth and has been featured in several launches in Europe, including Ocutears Hydro+ by Santen and in Brazil, Viofta by EMS.In the Beauty segment, AptarGroupâs spray pumps continue to be chosen as the dispensing solution for several new fragrances by renowned brands. The dispensing pump is now part of the Revlon Illuminance foundation in North America. Star Drop, which ensures precise dispensing, is being used for a new skincare product in China. The companyâs mono-material fully recyclable pump continues to be featured on new products. In the Closures segment, the custom inverted closure with a self-sealing flow control valve has been chosen as the dispensing solution for the launch of another inverted dish soap brand.Price PerformanceShares of AptarGroup have gained 8.1% in the past year against the industryâs 9.1% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the Industrial Products sector are Worthington Industries, Inc.

TSCO, DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. DKS, Five Below, Inc. FIVE and Arhaus, Inc. ARHS.Industry: Retail - MiscellaneousLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2099664/4-retail-miscellaneous-stocks-with-potential-to-beat-industry-bluesA slowing economy and recessionary fears have hit consumer sentiment. As a result, U.S. consumer confidence dropped in April. Inflation and recession-wary shoppers have curtailed spending. Underlying price pressure, a slowing labor market and a higher interest rate environment have cooled demand. Of late, players in the Zacks Retail â Miscellaneous industry have been encountering these headwinds.That said, industry participants have been focusing on superior product strategy, advancement of omni-channel capabilities and prudent capital investments to strike the right chord with consumers. Tractor Supply Co., DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc., Five Below, Inc. and Arhaus, Inc. look well poised, courtesy of their business operating model and opportunities ahead.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail â Miscellaneous industry covers retailers of sporting goods, office supplies, and specialty products as well as sellers of a wide range of domestic merchandise. It also includes retailers of beauty products providing cosmetics, fragrances, skincare and haircare products, and salon styling tools.Some of the industry participants operate rural lifestyle retail stores, and arts and crafts specialty outlets, and sell their products to farmers, ranchers, and others as well as tradesmen and small businesses. The industry also comprises recreational boat and yacht retailers as well as specialty value retailers offering a broad range of trend-right, high-quality merchandise targeted at tween and teen customers. The players' profitability depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain, and an effective merchandising strategy.Story continues4 Key Industry TrendsPressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. They have been accelerating investments to strengthen the digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, any deleverage in SG&amp;A rate, higher labor and occupancy costs, and increased marketing and other store-related expenses might build pressure on margins.Nonetheless, companies have been focused on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks as well as adopting effective pricing policies.Consumer Confidence Slid: Concerns related to a slowing economy and a possible recession have hit consumersâ sentiments that slid to a nine-month low in April. Per Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index nudged down to 101.3 in April from 104 in March. A slump in consumers' confidence may have a direct impact on consumer spending, which accounts for over two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Also, the Fedâs aggressive rate hikes to tame inflation made things tough for consumers by squeezing disposable income. Consequently, demand has softened.Focus on Boosting Portfolio &amp; Market Reach: Most companies in the space are working on providing a wide assortment of products, enhancing the online experience and adopting a favorable pricing strategy to boost sales. Initiatives such as building omni-channel operations, coming up with reward programs, and developing innovative products and services are worth mentioning. There has been an increase in demand for office supplies, personal care items, domestic merchandise products and fitness-related products. Companies are looking to fuel sales via targeted marketing.Digitization Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns and behavior, industry participants have been playing dual in-store and online roles. In this respect, the industry players have been directing resources toward digital platforms, accelerating fleet optimization and augmenting the supply chain. In fact, companiesâ initiatives to expand delivery options â curbside pickup or ship-to-home orders â and contactless payment solutions have been a boon.Additionally, retailers are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumersâ product preferences and inclination toward online shopping, retailers are replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Retail â Miscellaneous industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail â Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #203, which places it in the bottom 19% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The groupâs Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates drab near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industryâs positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this groupâs earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of January 2023, the industryâs earnings estimate has declined 5.5%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, letâs take a look at the industryâs recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Vs.

302,5feddcfa-a6eb-3417-aa56-16447182fcf9,TSCO,2023-05-26,"Keep Your Eyes on These 2 Stocks, Says Truistâs Top Analyst",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/keep-eyes-2-stocks-says-154846476.html,1685029726.0,STORY,"['EWCZ', 'TSCO']","[For the average retail investor, the biggest question regarding the stock market today is how do I cut through the noise?The surest way to do that is to get expert advice. Find the best analysts out there, and watch the stocks they recommend. Wall Streetâs top analysts have built their success and reputations on the quality of their calls. And fortunately for us, all of those calls are in the public domain â meaning we can parse that data to find the analyst who stands out from the crowd.TipRanksÂ has answered that call, compiling a comprehensive database of more than 8,400 analysts. These stock pros are rated and ranked based on the success of their stock reviews and the average return an investor would receive by following those reviews for one year.On those criteria, analystÂ Scot CiccarelliÂ stands head-and-shoulders above most of his peers. Boltonâs success rate is 73%, and his stock picks have generated 20.1% average return. Ciccarelli is a Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst at Truist Securities, which is also the #3-rated investment research firm by TipRanks.Now that we know who to trust, letâs take a look at two of Ciccarelliâs recent stock picks. These are all Buy-rated equities with double-digit upside potential in the offing.Tractor Supply (TSCO)The first stock weâll look at is Tractor Supply, a retailer in the outdoor supply sector. Tractor Supply is well-known as a supplier of tools and equipment for home, lawn, and garden, as well as equipment and gear aimed at farmers, ranchers, and professional landscapers. The companyâs product lines include tools and hardware, hunting gear, outdoor apparel and footwear, outdoor power tools and mowers, and pet and livestock supplies â the list is expansive.The long list of products and services is complemented by an extensive retail footprint. The company employs over 52,000 people in more than 2,100 stores across 49 states and has a history of expansion through mergers. In fact, Tractor Supply currently operates 2,164 stores, including 81 stores acquired last year from Orscheln Farm and Home. Tractor Supplyâs customer loyalty program boasts over 20 million members, and the chain ranks as one of the largest farm and ranch retailers in the US.Story continuesUnsurprisingly, Tractor Supplyâs earnings follow a predictable seasonal pattern, with the strongest results occurring in Q2 during the spring when retail customers and professionals restock their outdoor gear. The companyâs latest financial report, from 1Q23, showed a top line of $3.3 billion and a bottom line of $1.65 per share. Year-over-year, the revenue total increased by 9.1%, while the EPS remained flat.We should note that the Q1 revenue and earnings both missed analyst expectations, revenue by $11 million and EPS by 6 cents. The miss was attributed to slow sales due to the late arrival of spring weather â the longer-lasting winter conditions depressed demand.However, despite the earnings miss in Q1, investors have reasons to stay bullish, according to Ciccarelli.âWhile 1Q comps came in modestly below expectations (2.1% vs. our in-line ~5%E), it was largely driven by the late start to Spring/soft seasonal sales rather than broader consumer weakness. Supporting this view, the company experienced consistent sales in its âeveryday itemsâ (CUE outperformed the chain average), a wide divergence in sales performance by geographies and comps have accelerated to +MSD in April as weather headwinds have eased in some markets. Further, the late start to Spring could fuel incremental upside in 2Q and, potentially, even 3Q,â Ciccarelli explained.âWe believe TSCO remains one of the most compelling defensive growth equities in the market and remain aggressive buyers,â the top analyst summed up.Ciccarelli goes on to give this stock a Buy rating with a $280 price target that implies a 30% upside in the next 12 months.So, thatâs Ciccarelliâs view, letâs take a look now at what the rest of the Street has in mind for TSCO. Based on 12 Buys and 6 Holds, the analyst consensus rates the stock a Moderate Buy. With an average price target of $258.24, the analysts expect shares to appreciate 20% over the next 12 months. (See TSCO stock forecast)European Wax Center (EWCZ)The second stock weâll look at here is European Wax Center, a chain of retail hair-removal and skincare salons. Despite its name, European Wax Center was founded in Florida and is currently headquartered in Texas. The company operates 978 locations across the continental US and Hawaii, spanning a total of 45 states. Their services include body hair removal, with specialties such as eyebrow shaping, as well as skincare treatments offered both before and after waxing. These services are available for both women and men.Body waxing is a growing niche in the US, and European Wax Center is capitalizing on this trend. The company offers customers services provided by professional staff in the comfort of individual waxing suites. Their salons operate on a franchise basis, and in March of this year, the trade magazine Entrepreneur ranked European Wax Center as the 30th fastest-growing franchise in the US out of over 1,300 franchises ranked.Earlier this month, EWCZ reported its results for Q1 of fiscal year 2023. TheÂ  quarter, which ended on April 1 of this calendar year, showed a top line total revenue of $49.9 million. That revenue, while up 9.8% from the prior-year period, missed the forecast by ~$573,000. The company reported a GAAP net loss of $1.1 million, and an adjusted EBITDA figure of $16.3 million.During the quarter, EWCZ also showed some sound growth numbers. The company opened a net of 34 new centers, for a 12% year-over-year increase, and its system-wide sales were up 5.5% to $218.4 million. The chainâs same-store sales grew y/y by 4.5%.Checking in again with Ciccarelli, we find him taking an upbeat stance on EWCZ, writing of the stock: âOverall demand trends are very solid (and likely to look even better following other EPS reports), EWCZ is highly profitable, has a massive expansion opportunity (3x) and generates huge returns for their franchisees (estimated ~60% cash on cash returns by year 5).âIn-line with those comments, Ciccarelli gives EWCZ shares a Buy rating, and his price target, set at $21, indicates his confidence in a 23% one-year upside potential.Overall, the five recent analyst reviews on this stock break down to 2 Buys and 3 Holds, making a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares have a current trading price of $16.93 and the $19.60 average price target suggests ~16% upside from that level.

303,0af3b423-4ef6-31ee-9589-40b667fcedc5,TSCO,2023-05-26,4 Retail-Miscellaneous Stocks With Potential to Beat Industry Blues,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-retail-miscellaneous-stocks-potential-154500684.html,1685029500.0,STORY,"['TSCO', '^GSPC', 'ARHS', 'DKS']","[A slowing economy and recessionary fears have hit consumer sentiment. As a result, U.S. consumer confidence dropped in April. Inflation and recession-wary shoppers have curtailed spending. Underlying price pressure, a slowing labor market and a higher interest rate environment have cooled demand. Of late, players in the Zacks Retail â Miscellaneous industry have been encountering these headwinds.That said, industry participants have been focusing on superior product strategy, advancement of omni-channel capabilities and prudent capital investments to strike the right chord with consumers. Tractor Supply Company TSCO, DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. DKS, Five Below, Inc. FIVE and Arhaus, Inc. ARHS look well poised, courtesy of their business operating model and opportunities ahead.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail â Miscellaneous industry covers retailers of sporting goods, office supplies, and specialty products as well as sellers of a wide range of domestic merchandise. It also includes retailers of beauty products providing cosmetics, fragrances, skincare and haircare products, and salon styling tools. Some of the industry participants operate rural lifestyle retail stores, and arts and crafts specialty outlets, and sell their products to farmers, ranchers, and others as well as tradesmen and small businesses. The industry also comprises recreational boat and yacht retailers as well as specialty value retailers offering a broad range of trend-right, high-quality merchandise targeted at tween and teen customers. The players' profitability depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain, and an effective merchandising strategy.4 Key Industry TrendsPressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. They have been accelerating investments to strengthen the digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, any deleverage in SG&amp;A rate, higher labor and occupancy costs, and increased marketing and other store-related expenses might build pressure on margins. Nonetheless, companies have been focused on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks as well as adopting effective pricing policies.Story continuesConsumer Confidence Slid: Concerns related to a slowing economy and a possible recession have hit consumersâ sentiments that slid to a nine-month low in April. Per Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index nudged down to 101.3 in April from 104 in March. A slump in consumers' confidence may have a direct impact on consumer spending, which accounts for over two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Also, the Fedâs aggressive rate hikes to tame inflation made things tough for consumers by squeezing disposable income. Consequently, demand has softened.Focus on Boosting Portfolio &amp; Market Reach: Most companies in the space are working on providing a wide assortment of products, enhancing the online experience and adopting a favorable pricing strategy to boost sales. Initiatives such as building omni-channel operations, coming up with reward programs, and developing innovative products and services are worth mentioning. There has been an increase in demand for office supplies, personal care items, domestic merchandise products and fitness-related products. Companies are looking to fuel sales via targeted marketing.Digitization Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns and behavior, industry participants have been playing dual in-store and online roles. In this respect, the industry players have been directing resources toward digital platforms, accelerating fleet optimization and augmenting the supply chain. In fact, companiesâ initiatives to expand delivery options â curbside pickup or ship-to-home orders â and contactless payment solutions have been a boon. Additionally, retailers are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumersâ product preferences and inclination toward online shopping, retailers are replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Retail â Miscellaneous industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail â Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #203, which places it in the bottom 19% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The groupâs Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates drab near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industryâs positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this groupâs earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of January 2023, the industryâs earnings estimate has declined 5.5%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, letâs take a look at the industryâs recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Vs.

The figure moved up 3.3% and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.6%.Without certain one-time adjustments â including restructuring and associated costs, amortization, acquisition-related costs and the new European Union medical device regulation charges, among othersâ GAAP EPS was 88 cents, down 20% from the year-ago quarterâs reported figure.For the full year, adjusted earnings were $5.29 per share, reflecting a 4.7% fall from the year-ago period. However, it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.2%.Total RevenuesWorldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed $8.54 billion, up 5.6% year over year on both organic basis (excluding the impacts of currency and contribution from the company's fiscal first-quarter acquisition of Intersect ENT) and on a reported basis. The top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.6%.Fourth-quarter organic revenues, according to the company, reflect strong performances in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience business, outside the United States.Total revenues for 2023 were $31.23 billion, down 1.4% on a reported basis and up 2.1% on an organic basis. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1%.Segment DetailsThe company generates revenues from four major segments, namely Cardiovascular Portfolio, Medical Surgical Portfolio, Neuroscience Portfolio and Diabetes.In the fiscal fourth quarter, Cardiovascular revenues increased 12% at CER to $3.32 billion, with all three divisions reporting organic growth this quarter.Cardiac Rhythm &amp; Heart Failure sales totaled $1.58 billion, up 1.8% year over year at CER.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yearâs adjusted earnings is $5.18.Our TakeMedtronic recorded earnings and revenue beat in the fiscal fourth quarter. The company's Q4 organic revenue results reflect strong performances in the Cardiovascular, Medical Surgical, and Neuroscience portfolios, and in Diabetes markets outside the United States. During the quarter, the company received the FDA approval for the MiniMed 780G system with the Guardian 4 sensor.However, a substantial decline in Medical Surgical revenues is a concern. The contraction of both margins raises apprehension too. Macroeconomic headwinds related to persistent inflation and unfavorable foreign currency movements continue to challenge the companyâs earnings performance.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced their quarterly results are Hologic, Inc.

The expansion enables an always-on connection to the Masimo Health secure cloud for 4 million devices, thus empowering consumers with an enhanced health-tracking experience.The software upgrade allows Masimoâs devices and secure cloud solution to seamlessly integrate with HEOS-enabled sound bars and wireless speakers, among others, from Denon, Marantz and Definitive Technology worldwide. This includes the United States, Canada, the UK, Japan and Australia, with more countries going live later in 2023.The latest expansion is a major stepping stone for Masimoâs real-time patient monitoring business and is likely to solidify its position in the niche space on a global scale.Significance of the ExpansionMasimoâs HEOS ecosystem platform, combined with Masimo's wearable health and wellness devices (including the Masimo W1 advanced health tracking watch and, soon, the Stork baby monitor), will likely allow users to keep track of their health and wellness.

Today, she's the VP of Global Digital Marketing and Customer Experience at Boston Scientific, advancing the company's commercial and digital capabilities to ensure they meet the needs of customers, patients and consumers.For Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month, Lee talks to us about how her culture has influenced her career - and how Boston Scientific has supported her along the way.Q: Tell us a bit about your childhood.I grew up in Tallahassee, FL, as a first-generation American, the youngest of three girls. My parents came from Korea to get their PhDs.When I looked around at my friend group, there weren't a lot of people that looked like me. But I didn't realize that I was different for a very long time.Q: When did that difference start to become clear to you?One day, on the bus, a student came up to me and in a very negative tone said, ""How come you don't have any eyelashes?"" It didn't make sense to me, because I didn't know my eyes were different. I went home and I started to talk with my parents about it. My being different became very clear, and also the impact that it had on the people around me.Q: Asian Americans are underrepresented at the highest levels of their fields, due to a mix of organizational and cultural factors author Jane Hyun calls the ""bamboo ceiling"". Is this a concept you can relate to?I do think it's real. The ability to see yourself in those above you is important. When I look at CEOs of other companies and even leadership within my own company there just aren't a lot of people who look like me.Story continuesThat said, I feel like my ""bamboo ceiling"" is a bit self-imposed. Cultural values can be so engrained, and my upbringing and familial values around discipline, achievement, deference to authority, self-effacement and harmony are sometimes in discord with business needs and priorities.For instance, when people give me kudos, my first instinct is to push it away. My mentors tell me to own my successes. But that is still very difficult for me.The second thing is speaking up in meetings. In the back of my head, I ask myself so many questions: am I not giving someone else the space to speak? Is someone else going to say this anyway?There is a point as a leader when you wonder, ""Am I good enough? Or am I getting these roles because I am diverse?"" To be honest, I still struggle with it.Q: Do you feel you have been treated differently in the corporate world because you're a minority?As I get more senior in my career, and especially at Boston Scientific, the subtle, day-to-day microaggressions have been minimized. I identify as LGBTQ, and I feel more microaggressions because of that piece of my identity than from being Asian American.Every company has their values. But we lean into the caring value so hard at Boston Scientific. At all levels of the organization, I feel like people are open to what you have to say, and because of that culture, your ability to make an impact is enormous. I truly feel that I'm able to be who I am and deliver as best as I can at Boston Scientific.Q: How were you able to break through your own ""bamboo ceiling""?Being aware of the discord between my cultural values and workplace values has been essential. Knowing that I'm in an environment where I feel safe to speak up and that I don't always have to defer to someone more senior or have 100% alignment from every stakeholder to move the needle forward has been critical. As I have more experience, I gain more confidence in this area - but it's a muscle I am constantly building.Finding mentorship is critical to anyone's success. I make a point of being proactive about networking, whether it's through employee resource groups or keeping in touch with former managers.I also try to keep a learning mindset, staying open to growth and betterment.And I see it as my responsibility to help pull others up. I hope that I am leading by example and paving a path that in the future becomes easier for others.Q: What would you say to people want to support their AAPI colleagues in the ways you've felt supported?Attending employee resource group events, reading books and simply talking with your AAPI colleagues are great ways to learn more about what they're going through and the whys behind their values. It can be helpful to give them grace and space to push their cultural boundaries.I am so grateful for my allies-people who support me and all my intersectionalities and take time to appreciate and understand my background. So for all of the allies out there, thank you for trying. It may not always go perfectly but leaning into that is where we all grow and come closer together.Boston Scientific is committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace where all of our employees can bring their authentic selves to work and thrive personally and professionally.

Robust demand for consumer loans and higher interest rates are likely to aid top-line growth.However, mounting expenses and deteriorating asset quality make us apprehensive about the companyâs growth prospects.Analysts are also not very optimistic regarding the companyâs earnings growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has been revised 12.8% lower over the past 30 days. Capital One currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past year, shares of COF have lost 20.1% compared with the industryâs decline of 15.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLooking at its fundamentals, while the companyâs revenues declined marginally in 2020, the same witnessed a five-year (2017-2022) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.7%. The uptrend continued in the first quarter of 2023. Opportunistic buyouts over the years have been driving revenues.In 2021, COF acquired TripleTree, LLC, which will further enhance its investment banking capabilities. In 2019, it acquired KippsDeSanto and thus, forayed into the merger and acquisitions market. Also, the acquisitions of Beech Street Capital and GE's healthcare unit reflect Capital Oneâs revenue diversifying efforts.Revenue prospects look encouraging on the back of the companyâs solid credit card and online banking businesses as well as decent loan demand. We expect total revenues to grow 3.1%, 2.5% and 7.3% in 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively.After slashing rates thrice in 2019, the central bank cut interest rates to near zero in March 2020 (to cushion the U.S. economy from the coronavirus-induced mayhem), which hurt COFâs net interest income (NII) and net interest margin (NIM). Nevertheless, with the Federal Reserve expected to keep interest rates high in the near term (although the pace of the rate hikes will slow down), NII and NIM are likely to witness continued improvements. Our estimates for NII reflect a CAGR of 4.2% by 2025.COFâs capital-deployment initiatives look encouraging. After slashing the quarterly dividend by 75% in 2020 based on the Federal Reserveâs requirements, Capital One restored the same to 40 cents per share in 2021. In July 2021, it hiked the same by 50% to 60 cents per share.The company also has a share repurchase plan in place. Based on its earnings strength and solid liquidity position, Capital Oneâs enhanced capital deployment plans look sustainable.However, the companyâs asset quality has been deteriorating. Provision for credit losses and net charge-offs (NCOs) have been steadily rising. Though provisions fell in 2018 and were a benefit in 2021, these increased in the rest of the years till 2022. Similarly, NCOs declined in 2018, 2020 and 2021, while witnessing a jump in 2019 and 2022.Both provisions and NCOs increased in the first quarter of 2023. The companyâs credit quality is likely to remain under pressure in the near term, given the rising loan balance and deteriorating macroeconomic outlook.Capital Oneâs expenses witnessed a CAGR of 6.2% for the last five years (ended 2022). The increase was mainly due to a rise in marketing costs and inflationary pressure. The upward trend in costs continued in the first quarter of 2023.Expense levels are expected to remain elevated, given the companyâs continued investments in technology and infrastructure as well as inorganic expansion efforts. Our estimates for total non-interest expenses suggest a CAGR of 7.8% by 2025.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are Pathward Financial, Inc. CASH and First Citizens BancShares FCNCA.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Pathward Financialâs current fiscal yearâs earnings has been revised 1.8% upward over the past 60 days.

For a deeper dive into how we make our Pro Picks, read more here.Signet JewelersSignet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG) was snapped up by The Big Shortâs Michael Burry last quarter for a $9.7 million investment, or 9.1% of his Scion Capital portfolio. And itâs no wonder: The jewelry retailer boasts 375% growth in cumulative diluted earnings per share over the past three years, as well as exceptional free cash flow yield, both of which contribute to its excellent 3.38 InvestingPro financial health score. And Signet has been diligently returning cash to shareholders, bumping up its share-buyback program yet again in March to an authorization of $775 million. It also hiked its dividend for the second year running, now paying out a 1.3% annual yield to investors.Shares are up more than 7% for the year, and look to have plenty of runway left: both analysts and InvestingProâs fair value algorithm puts share upside at roughly 34% above current levels.Capital One FinancialMichael Burry also disclosed a $7.2 million stake in Capital One (NYSE:COF), or 6.7% of his portfolio. InvestingPro gives the credit card company a burly health score of 3.29 out of 5, supported by its sky-high earnings yield and free cash flow yield. Capital One has also been buying back shares and pays a hearty 2.4% dividend. The company reported under-consensus earnings last month, but Credit Suisse reiterated its Outperform rating on the stock, citing strong card loan growth and purchase volume in the report. Shares are up about 7% for the year, and InvestingProâs fair value calculations give the stock plenty more upside ahead.Story continuesTenet HealthcareOver at David Einhornâs Greenlight Capital - which was up some 37% last year - the investor has doubled his stake in Tenet Healthcare (NYSE:THC) to $84.8 million, or 4.6% of his portfolio. Tenetâs profitability health is top-notch thanks to the hospital operatorâs cushy margins and returns, and it just recently crushed Q1 earnings and revenue estimates while also ratcheting up guidance for the full year. All of this supports Tenetâs solid 3.12 InvestingPro health score, and the company is also aggressively buying back shares. Brokerages overwhelmingly rate the stock a buy, looking for a more-than-20% share climb. And InvestingPro fair value gives the stock more than 30% upside, even after its 40% surge since the start of the year.Hilton HotelsMeanwhile, activist investor Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Management still maintains his longtime Hilton (NYSE:HLT) stake, having picked up a few more shares for a $1.31 billion investment, or 12.8% of his portfolio. The hotel operator sports a lofty 3.09 InvestingPro financial health score, in large part thanks to its strong showing in profitability and earnings growth. Analyst targets give plenty of room for upside, and Barclays (LON:BARC) just upgraded it to Overweight, calling it a âbest-in-class lodging C-corpâ with âoutstandingâ expansion of its hotel portfolio, or net unit growth. Shares are up nearly 10% year to date.Chipotle Mexican GrillChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is another long-running Bill Ackman investment, and as of Q1 amounted to $1.76 billion, or a whopping 17.2% of his portfolio. The fast-casual restaurateur commands an outstanding 3.37 InvestingPro financial health score, undergirded by fantastic profitability and growth vs. its peers. It also flew past Q1 earnings estimates last month, in response to which Credit Suisse said it continues âto have high conviction in this rare compounding growth story,â while TD Cowen said the stock remains a top 3 pick at the research firm. Shares are up some 50% for the year.Related ArticlesInvestingPro exclusive: Invest like Wall Street Titans With These 5 SparklersProcter &amp; Gamble earns second upgrade this week, JPMorgan raises on EPS upsideUBS upgrades First Solar to Buy on 2023 credit boost]"

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Ulta: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

Seana, what are we watching right now?SEANA SMITH: Akiko, we have a couple of other names for you, a mix of gainers and losers here in after-hours trading. Let's kick it off with Gap because we're looking at a gain of just about 16%, following their most recent earnings report here. Upbeat results from the company-- better than expected earnings, margin improvement. Cost-cutting efforts really starting to pay off. Also inventory improvement, certainly a theme that we have heard about this earnings season. Inventory falling 27% on a year over year basis.Now, all of this overshadowing the losses that we did see in comp sales across all of the brands here, that fell just about 3%, mostly driven by the large drops that we saw in Banana Republic and Athleta. The company also saying that it's still searching for a permanent CEO. We know that has been an issue for shareholders for analysts lately.Year to date, we're looking at losses of just about 34%. Moving on to RH, another retail play here. That stock off about 3% in extended trading. They cut their full-year margin forecast, saying that a likely have to offer more markdowns as a result of the need to clear some of that inventory that it cannot clear.That also week ago, we heard from the 13 up filing from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's company there, that they did sell their stake in RH. So another problem here for the company here going forward. Year to date, we're looking at losses of just about 5%.Ulta Beauty, the cosmetic play here, down just about 9% in extended trading. They did temper their margin expectations. That is weighing on the stock in extended trading. Now, in this release, the company did note some of the challenges that they face due to thefts, something that we have also heard from other retailers this earnings season. The company saying that organized retail crime increasingly a challenge here. Year to date, shares are essentially flat.And rounding out with Workday. That's a big gainer after hours, up just about 8%, a beat on both the top and bottom line. Subscription revenue up 20% on a year over year basis. The company also announcing a new CFO Zane Rowe, formerly the CFO at VMware. This company also was one of these names to mention AI in this earnings release, writing, quote, ""We remain committed to innovation and infusing AI across our entire product portfolio."" Year to date, we're looking at gains of just about 17%.AKIKO FUJITA: Got to sprinkle in AI in those calls. Thanks so much for that, Seana.]"

However, low cash balance is worrisome.Factors Favoring NSCIn first-quarter 2023, railway operating revenues increased 7.5% year over year to $3,132 million. Key segments like Merchandise and Coal, registered improvements in revenues. Total revenue per unit rose 8% year over year, driven by higher fuel surcharges and pricing. Income from railway operations climbed 1% year over year to $1,098 million. Such impressive top-line performance, despite the challenging backdrop, is indeed commendable.Despite COVID-19-related woes, Norfolk Southern is committed to rewarding its shareholders.Â  In 2020, the company returned $2,399 million to shareholders through a combination of dividends ($960 million) and share buybacks ($1,439 million).Â  In 2021, shareholders were rewarded to the tune of $4,418 million, through dividends ($1,028 million) and share buybacks (3,390 million).In January 2023, management announced a 9% increase in its quarterly dividend payout. This was the fourth dividend hike announced by the company in a yearâs time. During 2022, Norfolk Southern paid dividends worth $1,167 million, up 13.5% year over year.NSC repurchased and retired common stock worth $3,110 million in 2022. Norfolk Southernâs strong free cash flow generating ability supports its pro-investor activities.Key RisksNSC exited 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $456 million compared with $839 million at the end of 2021. It had a long-term debt of $14,479 million at the end of 2022 compared with $13,287 million at 2021 end. Norfolk Southern exited first-quarter 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $552 million and long-term debt of $14,585 million.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, NSC carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector are Copa Holdings, S.A. CPA and Allegiant Travel Company ALGT.Story continuesCopa Holdings, which presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is aided by improved air-travel demand. We are encouraged by Copa Holdings' initiatives to modernize its fleet. CPA's focus on its cargo segment is also impressive. You can see the complete list of todayâs Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.For second-quarter and full-year 2023, CPAâs earnings are expected to register 669% and 65% growth, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Allegiant, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), also benefits from buoyant air-travel demand.

330,f17ecc2d-3aa4-3ad2-8f21-bac8272d8f80,WM,2023-05-26,"Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 83% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waste-management-inc-nyse-wm-140031365.html,1685023231,STORY,['WM'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Waste Management's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions51% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholdersUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyIf you want to know who really controls Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 83% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Waste Management, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Waste Management ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Waste Management?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Waste Management. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Waste Management's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Waste Management is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.2% of shares outstanding. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Asset Trust is the second largest shareholder owning 8.7% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.4% of the company stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 25 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Waste ManagementThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Waste Management, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$130m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 17% stake in Waste Management. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Waste Management better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Waste Management  you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

The acquisition of Oak Street Health is expected to advance CVS Healthâs care delivery strategy for consumers. Yet, poor macroeconomic conditions and stiff competition remain concerns.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 25.6% compared with the industryâs 26.8% fall and the S&amp;P 500âs 8.4% decline.The pharmacy innovation company, with integrated offerings across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care, has a market capitalization of $88.23 billion. The company projects 6.4% growth for the next five years. It surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 4.7%.Riding on current business growth and bullish near-term prospects, the company is worth holding on to for now.Key Growth CatalystsQ1 Upsides: CVS Healthâs first-quarter 2023 earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Robust sales growth across all three operating segments drove the top-line results. Within the Health Care Benefits arm, the continued growth across the entire range of insured and self-insured medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health products and services instils optimism. It completed the colossal $10.6-billion acquisition of Oak Street Health. Oak Street Health is a network of value-based primary care centres for adults on Medicare. The acquisition is expected to further advance CVS Healthâs care delivery strategy for consumers.Health Care Benefit Shows Potential: Following the colossal acquisition of health insurance giant Aetna for a colossal sum of $70 billion, CVS Health has introduced its Health Care Benefits business arm. This segment has been exhibiting continued strong momentum for the past few quarters. In the first quarter, the segment revenues grew more than 12%. Overall medical costs were well controlled and in line with expectations. Membership in the first quarter increased by 1 million members versus the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by the significant increase in the individual exchange business.Story continuesUpbeat Guidance: CVS Health reduced its adjusted EPS guidance for full-year 2023 to the band of $8.50 to $8.70 from $8.70 to $8.90. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings is pegged at $8.76.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company has reiterated its full-year operating cash flow projection in the range of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion.DownsidesCompetitive Landscape: Despite significant new client wins in the course of a strong selling season, intense competition and tough industry conditions act as major impediments. Major competitors such as Walgreens, Target and Wal-Mart are expanding their pharmacy businesses. Competition is especially tough in the pharmacy segment, as other retail businesses continue to add pharmacy departments and low-cost pharmacy options become available. Discount retailers, in particular, have made substantial inroads in gaining market share.Poor Macroeconomic Condition: Although prescriptions and related health care service providers like CVS stay out of general macro-economic turmoil, the recent debt crisis and sluggish economic conditions in U.S. could impact consumer purchasing power. This may also influence preferences and spending patterns and result in low prescription utilization.Estimate TrendsIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2023 earnings has been down 2.4% of $8.65.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $346.7 billion, suggesting a 7.5% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Addus Homecare Corporation ADUS, Merit Medical Systems, Inc.

And that is going to affect things. And I think we're probably somewhat too arrogant in our ability to raise pricing in an easy-demand environment,"" Friedman acknowledged. ""And as the easy demand environment has waned, and it's required us to kind of really challenge, is our value equation going to create the level of demand that we believe is right for the business?""Judging by the latest results from RH, formerly known as Restoration Hardware, consumers don't see the value in putting a $2,300 wood dining room table on a charge card with a much higher interest rate attached to it. That's especially as the housing market continues to be under pressure.The California-based furnishings retailer's first quarter sales tanked 23% year over year to $739.2 million, it reported Thursday. Gross profit margins dropped to 47% from 52.1% a year earlier.Friedman said RH will now move aggressively to pare down excess inventory this year by offering discounts, which will take a bite out of margins.Full-year adjusted operating margins are pegged in a range of 14.5% to 15.5%, down from 15% to 17%. Sales for the year were guided to $3 billion to $3.1 billion, up from $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion as Friedman bets consumers will bite at his promotions.""$1.5 billion in cash and $1.5 billion remaining in share repurchases create a floor for the stock, though we see limited upside given our view that 20% operating margins may not be on the table until 2025. We believe new product launches under the RH Contemporary line at more amenable price points will spur demand in the second half, but not enough to push above the midpoint of guidance,"" warned Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski in a research note.Story continuesRH's struggles in part reflect poor execution by Friedman, but also the realities of the changing housing markets. The dynamics have tripped up everyone from a high-end furniture seller in RH in the past year to appliance maker Whirlpool to home improvement sellers Home Depot and Lowe's.Existing home sales in April fell 3.4% from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. Home prices declined for the third consecutive month.A new Redfin report this week revealed that nationwide home prices in April notched their steepest decline in more than a decade, declining by $18,000. Median home prices fell in 45 out of more than 90 metro markets, the report found.""We're launching it [our new product line] into maybe the worst home environment at the high end that I've ever seen in my career. I've never seen luxury housing down at the levels we've seen from recent reports and we're at 20-year high interest rates,"" Friedman added on the call.The stage is set for a similar tone from Friedman three months from now.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

This inaugural award recognizes U.S.-based companies with the most significant year-over-year reductions in scope 1 and scope 2 emissions relative to revenue.""We are proud to be named one of America's top climate leaders of 2023 in recognition of our ongoing commitment to reduce our climate impact and achieve our Net Zero goals,"" said Pam Klyn, Whirlpool Corporation's executive vice president of corporate relations and sustainability.""This progress has been made possible through the prioritization of energy retrofits, the use of offsite and onsite renewable energy, and continuous process improvements, which have all underpinned our environmental sustainability strategy that is focused on improving life at home and on the planet.""In 2003, Whirlpool Corporation was the first appliance manufacturer to set an emissions reduction target and has continued to make progress through ongoing investments. In 2022, the company achieved an approximately 25 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1 and scope 2) in its global plants and operations. Whirlpool Corporation activated two virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) that are expected to yield renewable energy to match 100 percent of Whirlpool Corp.'s electricity consumption by its U.S. manufacturing plants.This past year, as part of the company's longstanding commitment to sustainable operations, Whirlpool Corporation achieved Zero Waste to Landfill Gold or Platinum status (a greater than 95 percent diversion rate) at all 29 of its large manufacturing sites worldwide and has continued to invest in plant efficiency and waste reduction by working closely with recyclers and sustainability vendors to find new, innovative ways to eliminate waste and contribute to the circular economy.Story continuesOver the past several months, Whirlpool Corporation received several awards for its ongoing commitment to environmental and social sustainability, including being named to Forbes 2023 Best Brands for Social Impact list as well being recognized as one of America's Most JUST Companies for 2023.To create the inaugural list, USA Today partnered with Statista Inc, the world-leading statistics portal and industry ranking provider, to calculate the year-over-year reduction in emissions intensity (compound annual reduction rate). Companies headquartered in the United States that achieved the greatest reduction in their core emissions intensity - that is, their scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions relative to revenue - between 2019 and 2021 were included in the list.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Whirlpool Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Whirlpool CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/whirlpool-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Whirlpool CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/757308/Whirlpool-Corporation-Recognized-as-One-of-Americas-Climate-Leaders-for-2023-by-USA-Today]"

One oil seep has so far been identified in the basin giving an indication of a petroleum system in the area,"" it added.A new hydrocarbon-rich area would help add to country's petroleum resources and potentially boost the viability of the refinery and a crude export pipeline under development.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2023 and 2024 is pegged at $22.35 and $14.58 per share, respectively.Whatâs Favoring the Stock?Valero, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is a best-in-class oil refiner involved in producing fuels and products that can meet the demand of modern life. Its refineries are located across the United States, Canada and the U.K. A total of 15 petroleum refineries where Valero has ownership interests have a combined throughput capacity of approximately 3.2 million barrels per day.The Renewable Diesel business segment of VLO comprises the Diamond Green Diesel (DGD) joint venture. DGD, a joint venture between Darling Ingredients Inc. and Valero, is a leading renewable fuel producer in North America.

344,993b2bf4-98d0-399a-a865-fea88f1e4592,UNH,2023-05-26,Allison Transmission and Alico have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/allison-transmission-alico-highlighted-zacks-125400734.html,1685019240,STORY,"['ALSN', 'ALCO', 'HCA', 'PFE', 'UNH']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL â May 25, 2023 â Zacks Equity Research shares Allison Transmission Holdings ALSN as the Bull of the Day and Alico ALCO as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on UnitedHealth Group UNH, HCA Healthcare HCA and Pfizer PFE.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Allison Transmission Holdings, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is witnessing bullish tailwinds including a set of strategic buyouts and new product launches that bode well for the automotive parts company. The stock is breaking out to the upside and hit an all-time high earlier this year. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to make new highs amid an uncertain economic environment. Shares continue to display relative strength as buying pressure accumulates in this market leader.ALSN sports the highest Zacks Value Style Score of âA,â indicating further upside based on favorable valuation metrics. The company is part of the Zacks Automotive â Original Equipment industry group, which ranks in the top 45% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries.Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stockâs price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Itâs no secret that investing in stocks that are part of leading industry groups can give us a leg up relative to the market. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.Company DescriptionAllison Transmission Holdings designs, manufactures, and sells commercial and defense automatic transmissions for medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles. The company offers transmissions for various applications including distribution, construction, fire, and emergency on-highway trucks; school and transit buses; energy and mining off-highway vehicles; and wheeled and tracked defense vehicles.Story continuesALSN provides transmissions and electric propulsion solutions under the Allison Transmission brand name, as well as remanufactured transmissions under the ReTran brand name. In addition, the company sells branded replacement parts, support equipment, engineering services, and defense kits. ALSN markets its products to original equipment manufacturers, distributors, and the U.S. government through approximately 1,600 independent distributor and dealer locations.Strategic buyouts such as Walker Die Casting, C&amp;R Tool &amp; Engineering, and Vantage Power are set to boost company prospects. New product launches in China such as the FracTran â a next-generation hydraulic fracturing transmission product â will help buoy sales in the coming quarters.Earnings Trends and Future EstimatesALSN has built up an impressive earnings history, surpassing earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters. Back in April, the company reported first-quarter earnings of $1.85/share, a 21.71% surprise over the $1.52 consensus estimate. ALSN has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 12.84%.The ALSN growth engine is expected to remain hot this year, as analysts covering the automotive parts company have increased their EPS estimates across the board. Full-year estimates have been raised by +9.8% in the past 60 days. The 2023 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $6.61/share, reflecting potential growth of 19.53% relative to the same quarter in the prior year.Letâs Get TechnicalALSN shares have advanced nearly 30% in the past year. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio â one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.Notice how both the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are sloping up. The stock has been making a series of higher highs. With both strong fundamentals and technicals, ALSN is poised to continue its outperformance.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, Allison Transmission Holdings has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and ALSN continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run this year. Despite the impressive performance, ALSN currently trades relatively undervalued at just a 7.31 forward P/E.Bottom LineSolid institutional buying should continue to provide a tailwind for the stock price. ALSN is ranked favorably by our Zacks Style Score Categories, with an âAâ for Value and âBâ for Growth, paving the way for an overall âAâ VGM score. Increasing volume at recent breakout levels is another bullish sign.Robust fundamentals combined with a strong technical trend certainly justify adding shares to the mix. Backed by a leading industry group and robust history of earnings beats, itâs not difficult to see why this company is a compelling investment. Investors would be wise to consider ALSN as a portfolio candidate if they havenât already done so.Bear of the Day:Alico operates as an agribusiness and land management company in the United States. Alico cultivates citrus trees to produce citrus for delivery to the processed and fresh citrus markets. In addition, ALCO is involved in cattle ranching, sugarcane and sod production, and forestry. The company also owns and manages land for leasing, grazing, conservation, and mining activities. Based out of Fort Myers, ALCO owns over 74,000 acres of land in Florida.The Zacks RundownALCO, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a component of the Zacks Agriculture â Operations industry group, which ranks in the bottom 13% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.Candidates in the bottom tiers of industries can often be solid potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in a poor-performing industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.Along with many other agricultural stocks, ALCO experienced a climax top in April of last year and has been in a price downtrend ever since. The share price is hitting a series of lower lows and represents a compelling short opportunity as the market remains volatile.Recent Earnings Misses &amp; Deteriorating OutlookALCO has fallen short of earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters. Earlier in May, the company reported a fiscal Q2 loss of -$1.62/share, missing the $0.13/share consensus EPS estimate by -1,346.15%. Poor performance can be partially explained by decreased revenues due to lessened fruit production, as the company was still dealing with the fallout from Hurricane Ian.Still, over the past four quarters, ALCO has delivered an average earnings miss of -449.78%. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and Alico is no exception.ALCO has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. For the current fiscal year, analysts have decreased estimates by -186.17% in the past 60 days. The 2023 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate is now -$2.69/share, reflecting a -1,180.95% regression relative to fiscal 2022.Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.Technical OutlookALCO is in a sustained downtrend. The stock is making a series of lower lows, with no respite from the selling in sight.While not the most accurate indicator, ALCO has also experienced what is known as a âdeath cross,â wherein the stockâs 50-day moving average (blue line) crosses below its 200-day moving average. ALCO would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. The stock has fallen nearly 40% in the past year alone.Final ThoughtsA deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to produce fresh highs anytime soon. The fact that ALCO is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stockâs downtrend.Our Zacks Style Scores depict a weakening outlook for this stock, as ALCO is rated a worst-possible âFâ in our Value category and âFâ for our overall VGM score. Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of ALCO until the situation shows major signs of improvement.Additional content:Debt Ceiling Crisis Looms: How Will It Impact Medical Stocks?The United States is facing a looming debt-ceiling crisis that could have disastrous consequences for the global economy. The debt ceiling, or debt limit, is the total amount the U.S. government is allowed to borrow to finance its expenditure, such as paying salaries and welfare allowances.On Jan 19, the United States hit its debt ceiling limit of $31.4 trillion, leading to a standoff between the White House and Congress over how to raise or suspend the limit, per a Reuters article. A continued impasse related to the debt-ceiling crisis will impact all sectors. The medical companies may face challenges as government healthcare spending may get reduced or halted without a resolution.Probable Impact of the CrisisU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the country could default on its debt as early as Jun 1, 2023 if the impasse is not resolved. A default would mean that the United States would fail to pay its creditors, such as foreign governments and investors, who hold U.S. Treasury bonds. This could trigger a financial crisis that would have a ripple effect across the world, impacting markets, trade and currencies.A potential default will also have significant implications for the healthcare industry, with the government focusing more on repaying its debt than healthcare-related spending. The default may also impact Social Security and unemployment insurance benefits, leading to lower or delayed medical expenses by patients.Factors Causing High DebtThe debt-ceiling crisis is part of an ongoing political debate within Congress about federal government spending and the national debt that the U.S. government accrues. The United States has had large budget deficits for years, meaning that it spends more than it collects in taxes. In fiscal year 2022, the federal government brought in $4.90 trillion but spent $6.27 trillion, with a net budget deficit of $1.38 trillion (the fourth highest of the 21st century).The main drivers of federal spending are mandatory programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Other expenses of the government comprise discretionary spending, which also includes defense. A portion of the budget is also spent on paying interest on the debt, which is expected to rise further as debt grows.Here we discuss three medical stocks that may be potentially impacted by the crisis going forward:UnitedHealth Group is the largest health insurer in the United States, serving more than 150 million customers through its various plans, including Medicare and Medicaid. A default may result in a potential disruption in UNHâs revenue stream and cash flow. Shares of UnitedHealth Group have declined 9.6% so far this year.HCA Healthcare, the largest for-profit hospital operator in the United States, owns and operates 186 hospitals and 121 freestanding surgery centers across 20 states and the United Kingdom. HCA could get delayed payments from Medicare and Medicaid, which account for about 40% of its net revenues in case of a default. Shares of HCA Healthcare have gained 11.6% so far this year.Pfizer, one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies, produces and sells a wide range of drugs and vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccine. A default may affect PFEâs ability to collect payments from government agencies and programs, such as the Department of Defense and the Veterans Health Administration. Shares of Pfizer have lost 22.6% so far this year.UnitedHealth Group, HCA Healthcare and Pfizer all carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of todayâs Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Debt Ceiling HistoryPer a Reuters article, the United States has raised its debt ceiling 78 times since 1960, usually without much controversy. However, in recent years, some lawmakers have used the debt ceiling as a leverage point to demand spending cuts or policy changes from the opposing party. This resulted in several near-default situations and government shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2019.Current ScenarioIn the current impasse, Republicans have proposed cutting spending back to 2022 levels as a precondition to raising the debt ceiling, while Democrats have insisted on a ""clean bill"" without preconditions, as had been the case in raising the ceiling three times during the Trump administration.President Joe Biden has urged Congress to act swiftly and responsibly to avoid a default that would harm millions of Americans and damage the country's reputation and creditworthiness. He has also ruled out invoking the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which some legal scholars argue gives him the authority to bypass Congress and raise the debt limit unilaterally. Biden has said he does not want to create a constitutional crisis over a fiscal one.As the deadline approaches, both sides are under pressure to reach a compromise or face the consequences of a historic default that could plunge the world into a new recession.Why Havenât You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

The pursuit of buyouts and a solid financial position are other tailwinds.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceUnitedHealth Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has lost 0.5% in the past month compared with theÂ industryâs 0.4% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFavorable Style ScoreUNH currently carries an impressiveÂ Value ScoreÂ of A.Robust Growth ProspectsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealth Groupâs 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.98 per share, which indicates an improvement of 12.6% from the year-ago reported figure. The same for revenues stands at $363.6 billion, implying 12.2% growth from the prior-year reported number.Impressive Earnings Surprise HistoryUNH boasts an impressive surprise record. Its earnings outpaced estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 4%.Solid Return on EquityUnitedHealth Groupâs efficiency in utilizing shareholdersâ funds can be substantiated by its trailing 12-month return on equity of 27.1%, which remains higher than the industryâs average of 24.8%.Robust 2023 OutlookUnitedHealth Group anticipates revenues between $357 billion and $360 billion, the mid-point of which indicates an improvement of 10.6% from the 2022 reported figure.Adjusted net earnings per share are estimated between $24.50 and $25 for the year. The mid-point of the updated guidance suggests 18.3% growth from the 2022 figure.Business TailwindsRevenues of UnitedHealth Group continue to benefit from solid contributions from its UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses. Premiums contributed 79.2% to the companyâs total revenues in the first quarter. It is expected to rise further as UnitedHealth continues to serve more people through Medicare and Medicaid Advantage plans.Through the UnitedHealthcare unit, UNH devises effective Medicare and Medicaid businesses, as well as integrates lucrative features within them from time to time. The top line of UnitedHealthcare segment is expected to benefit as the company grows its existing Medicaid markets and serves more people through fee-based and risk-based commercial offerings.Story continuesThe company expects to add more than 900,000 members to its Medicare Advantage plan this year, expanding its membership base and fetching higher premiums. The Medicaid business is set to grow from recent contract wins in Indiana and Texas and the expansion of existing service in North Carolina.Optum Health segment will continue to gain from more people served under value-based care arrangements and consistent strengthening of care delivery services. Optum Insight is expected to benefit from the addition of Change Healthcare and the performance of Optum Rx, which benefits from broadening pharmacy care services. Excellent customer retention should also favor Optum Rx results.UnitedHealth Group has been pursuing collaborations with renowned healthcare providers to bolster its capabilities and solidify its nationwide presence. Its acquisition of LHC Group should enhance and expand its in-home capabilities and fuel growth in the Optum Health segment. The companyâs launch of Price Edge and zero-cost life-saving drugs should help retain more customers in the future.The company also earns through investment income. The metric increased more than one-fold in the first quarter. A high-interest rate environment should boost this metric in the future.A solid financial position is a dire need for companies that keep an eye on continued business investments. Apart from growth-related initiatives, a sound financial stand instills confidence in UNH in the tactical deployment of capital through share buybacks and dividend payments. The company returned $3.5 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through share repurchases and dividends. Its dividend yield of 1.4% remains higher than the industryâs figure of 1.2%.Key ConcernsThe health insurer has been experiencing an increase in operating expenses due to higher medical and operating costs and the cost of goods sold. Such expenses continue to weigh on the margin expansion. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive growth in the long term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in theÂ MedicalÂ space areÂ Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Â AMPH, ICU Medical, Inc. ICUI andÂ ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ANIP. Each of these companies currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Here in the U.S., 1 in 5 girls have missed school due to the lack of access to period products1 â that is more than 3.5 million girls2.Since the launch of Alwaysâ #EndPeriodPoverty program in 2018, Always has donated more than 235 million period products to those in need around the world, including more than 75 million in the U.S. in partnership with Feeding America and other organizations. However, donations alone cannot resolve the systemic issue of period poverty. The stigma surrounding periods can prevent those affected from voicing their needs and prevents potential solutions from being widely discussed and implemented. To date, only 22 states have passed a law to provide free period products in some capacity. There is a need for national change to solve the issue of period poverty and if passed, Congresswoman Grace Mengâs Menstrual Equity for All Act would help do just that across the U.S.Story continues""People are often unaware the impact period poverty is having on so many individuals in their own communities and across the nation. Millions of people in the United States and around the world lack access to period products and are forced to forego educational or employment opportunities because of it,"" said Congresswoman Grace Meng. ""We cannot thrive as a society or economy without the full participation and education of women, girls, and people with periods in society. That is why I am proud to reintroduce my Menstrual Equity for All Act, a whole-of-government approach that will help ensure affordable access to menstrual products so that we can end period poverty.""To help address the ongoing need for period products, Always and International Paper â alongside congressional staff and Feeding America â hosted an event in Washington D.C. on May 24 to drive awareness around the issue of period poverty and the need for legislative policy, while packing 600 kits with period products to be given to Greater DC Diaper Bank and Maryâs Center. As part of the event, Always recognized and honored the incredible work of Always Period Heroes. Period Heroes represent people and organizations across the U.S. who have already made significant efforts to address period poverty in their local area.

348,409888b5-e249-3518-a92f-458e37a60628,PG,2023-05-26,Top 10 Billionaire Stocks From 10 Billionaires,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-10-billionaire-stocks-10-152146197.html,1685028106,STORY,"['MSFT', 'AAPL', 'BHC', 'PG', 'HZNP']","[In this article, we will take a look at the top 10 billionaire stocks from 10 billionaires. To see more such companies, go directly to Top 5 Billionaire Stocks From 5 Billionaires.If you want to become a billionaire, do what billionaires do. This is perhaps the most truthful clichÃ© statements that hold true irrespective of the global macro environment.Why should we pay attention to billionairesâ stock picks? The answer has always been hidden in plain sight. If you are looking at a group of billionaires who amassed their wealth and became billionaires solely by investing in the equity markets, it means they have been doing something right. And the compounding effect keeps giving them an edge in the markets which makes them stronger and better at the stock-picking game. For example, last year, when the stock market went through a bloodbath, HFRI Asset Weighted Composite Index, which gives more weighting to the larger funds, rose 0.97%. An important thing to note here is that smaller hedge funds didnât perform well in the same period when compared to their large counter parts. The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index, which gives equal weight to funds of all sizes, was down 4.25% in the year. A Wall Street Journal report analyzed this performance and pointed out the reasons behind this trend. It all comes to the benefits that come with size. Top hedge funds â which are often overseen or managed by billionaires â have a lot of resources, top talent, huge funds and technologies at their disposal. This arsenal often makes them immune to the losses and market shocks that crush smaller players in the market. This is the strategy Insider Money has been talking about for years since it has proved its mettle over the past several decades.When top money managers and billionaires share their opinion about the markets and their future, the world listens. According to a Bloomberg survey done last year, top investors predicted that stocks will post double-digit gains in 2023. The survey included 134 funds including BlackRock Inc., Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Amundi SA. But not everyone questioned in the survey had this opinion. Close to 50% of the respondents believed inflation and deep recession to be the serious threats to any market rally in 2023. However, overall, money managers were hopeful that the second half of 2023 would see solid gains.Story continuesThe Bloomberg report on this survey quoted Fabiana Fedeli, the chief investment officer for equities, multi-asset and sustainability at M&amp;G, who said:âThe outlook from here onward will be influenced by the probability, depth and longevity of recession. There are still pockets of opportunity where companies with strong fundamentals that are able to weather the storm get sold off in times of market panic.âEarlier this year, Bloomberg reported that researchers at Goldman Sachs had predicted that 2023 will be a strong year for hedge funds because they believed the market was shifting to become micro-driven instead of macro-driven. Goldman Sachs researchers had said that hedge funds were âwell-timed to take advantageâ of improving conditions for stock. They based their thoughts after analyzing the data of 758 hedge funds with $2.3 trillion of gross equity positions at the start of 2023.Lessons from the Sage BillionaireWarren Buffett sits at the top of the billionaires list in the world of investing. Luckily, we have tons of investor letters written by the Oracle of Omaha every year addressed to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. These letters provide a sneak peek into the legendary billionaireâs thought process and how he approaches wealth creation. In his 2009 letter, Buffett said the following which shows his humility, his commitment to solid investing principles and his readiness to see his mistakes and correct them:âLong ago, Charlie laid out his strongest ambition: âAll I want to know is where Iâm going to die, so Iâll never go there.â That bit of wisdom was inspired by Jacobi, the great Prussian mathematician, who counseled âInvert, always invertâ as an aid to solving difficult problems. (I can report as well that this inversion approach works on a less lofty level: Sing a country song in reverse, and you will quickly recover your car, house and wife.) Here are a few examples of how we apply Charlieâs thinking at Berkshire:Charlie and I avoid businesses whose futures we canât evaluate, no matter how exciting their products may be. In the past, it required no brilliance for people to foresee the fabulous growth that awaited such industries as autos (in 1910), aircraft (in 1930) and television sets (in 1950). But the future then also included competitive dynamics that would decimate almost all of the companies entering those industries. Even the survivors tended to come away bleeding.Just because Charlie and I can clearly see dramatic growth ahead for an industry does not mean we can judge what its profit margins and returns on capital will be as a host of competitors battle for supremacy. At Berkshire we will stick with businesses whose profit picture for decades to come seems reasonably predictable. Even then, we will make plenty of mistakes.We will never become dependent on the kindness of strangers. Too-big-to-fail is not a fallback position at Berkshire. Instead, we will always arrange our affairs so that any requirements for cash we may conceivably have will be dwarfed by our own liquidity. Moreover, that liquidity will be constantly refreshed by a gusher of earnings from our many and diverse businesses.âTop Billionaire Stocks From 10 BillionairesOur MethodologyFor this article, we used Insider Monkeyâs database of billionaire hedge fund managers and first chose 10 billionaires who founded, are running/overseeing top hedge funds in the US. We then looked at each fundâs stock holdings data for the first quarter of 2023 and picked each fundâs top stock pick. The list is ranked in ascending order of the total worth of billionaires discussed in the article. Some notable stocks in the list include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).Top 10 Billionaire Stocks From 10 Billionaires10. Bausch Health Companies (NYSE:BHC)Billionaire: John Paulson (Worth $3 billion)Billionaire John Paulson rose to fame after he successfully bet against the US subprime mortgage lending market and made $4 billion amid the financial crisis that started in 2007. He founded Paulson &amp; Co 1994. As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, his hedge fundâs top holding is Canadian-based Bausch Health Companies (NYSE:BHC). Bausch Health Companies (NYSE:BHC) is up about 32% year to date through May 20.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 41 hedge funds had stakes in Bausch Health Companies (NYSE:BHC). The total value of these stakes was $885 million. Paulson has a $214 million stake in Bausch Health Companies (NYSE:BHC).9. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Billionaire: Ken Fisher (Worth $6.2 billion)Billionaire Ken Fisher is one of those billionaires who are generous enough to share their wisdom with the public. These days he regularly shares his thoughts on his YouTube channel. He recently reiterated his âpessimism of disbeliefâ theory in a video and painted a positive and hopeful picture of the markets.While Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the top holding of Fisher, we picked Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Fisherâs second most favorite stock pick, for this article since Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also the favorite stock pick of another billionaire (Warren Buffett) and we donât want to have duplicates.Fisherâs hedge fund has a $7 billion stake in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) as of the end of March.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also the most popular stock among the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of the first quarter. Other famous stocks in our hedge fund database include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).Alger Spectra Fund made the following comment about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:âMicrosoft CorporationÂ (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate Americaâs transformative digitization. Microsoftâs CEO expects technology spending as a percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to jump from about 5% now to 10% in 10 years and that Microsoft will continue to capture market share within the technology sector. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office. LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services. Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows Devices, Gaming, and Search). While the company reported decent fiscal second quarter results, their investment in OpenAlâs ChatGPT captured the attention of investors. contributing to positive performance. Throughout the quarter. Microsoft surprised investors with continual rollouts of new Al capabilities across the companyâs portfolio (e.g., Bing, GitHub. Teams, Office 365). Furthermore, the company announced Microsoft 365 Copilot, which leverages GPT-4, a large language model, combined with the Microsoft Graph of data to provide Al virtual assistance. We believe Microsoftâs investment in OpenAl provides a first-mover advantage in the Al transformer model space. Despite challenges in the early days of Al-powered applications, the pace of Al innovation is faster than any other enterprise technology previously observed, in our view.â8. Coupang, Inc. (NYSE:CPNG)Billionaire: Stanley Druckenmiller (Worth $6.4 billion)Stanley Druckenmiller is one of the most respected billionaires out there and when he talks the world listens. Druckenmiller recently said at the 2023 Sohn Investment Conference that heâs looking at the âbiggest and probably the broadest asset bubble â forget that Iâve ever seen, but that Iâve ever studied.âHowever, Druckenmiller said there would be âunbelievable opportunitiesâ in the near future even if we see a hard landing.âAnd I donât want to miss those opportunities by blowing my money now and having some 20% or 30% loss where my head is all screwed up when those opportunities present themselves.âDruckenmillerâs hedge fund Duquesne Capitalâs top stock holding is South Korean e-commerce company Coupang, Inc. (NYSE:CPNG), in which the fund owns a $302 million stake.7. Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:HZNP)Billionaire: George Soros (Worth $6.7 billion)Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, who is also known as the man who âbroke the Bank of England,â restructured his hedge fund as family office in 2011 and retired from the world of investing in 2015 to focus more on political philanthropy. But his firm Soros Fund Management still discloses its holdings and taking a look at the fundâs data shows that Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:HZNP)Â  was its top stock pick as of the end of March 2023. The fund owns a $359 million stake in Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:HZNP).Aristotle Atlantic Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:HZNP) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:âHorizon Therapeutics Public Limited CompanyÂ (NASDAQ:HZNP) was a relative contributor, as its stock price was up on news that Amgen was acquiring the company for $116.50 per share, a roughly 36% premium to the pre-deal speculation price.6. CVR Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CVI)Billionaire: Carl Icahn (Worth $10 billion)Carl Icahn is one of the most famous activists hedge fund managers and billionaires in the world. The billionaireâs hedge fund Icahn Capitalâs portfolio shows that Icahn Enterprises was its biggest stock holding. But since Icahn is the owner of the conglomerate, itâs better to take a look at the next biggest holding of the fund. Itâs Texas-based petroleum refining company CVR Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CVI). Icahnâs hedge fund owns a $2.3 billion stake in CVR Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CVI).Like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) and Meta Platforms, Inc.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned -5.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, which P&amp;G falls in, has lost 5.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, P&amp;G is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share, indicating a change of +9.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.86 points to a change of +0.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.34 indicates a change of +8.2% from what P&amp;G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, P&amp;G is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PG _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of P&amp;G, the consensus sales estimate of $19.93 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.1%. The $81.38 billion and $85.02 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.5% and +4.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryP&amp;G reported revenues of $20.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $1.37 for the same period compares with $1.33 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.01%. The EPS surprise was +3.79%.Over the last four quarters, P&amp;G surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.P&amp;G is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&amp;G. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Through global grantmaking, it supports diverse, small, and mid-sized businesses; community development programs; microfinance initiatives; food and nutrition security; and expanded access to social and cultural institutions, disaster relief, and educational STEM opportunities.""Every day, people around the world face impossible financial decisions.

Grantees supported by Principal Foundation include:World Central Kitchen (WCK) - Principal Foundation issued a $1 million grant that helped fund a program developed by WCK to leverage technology, local restaurants, and local community organizations to provide restaurant-prepared meals for families experiencing food and nutrition security.

Aflac, Unum Group, Employers Holdings and AMERISAFE should continue benefiting from prudent underwriting standards. However, a rise in claims frequency could weigh on the positives.The industry has been witnessing soft pricing over the past several quarters, which is not expected to change any time soon. Nonetheless, a rise in claims, with business activities returning to normal levels, is likely to increase pricing for this industry. Also, the increasing adoption of technology in operations will help in the smooth functioning of the industry amid coronavirus-induced challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Accident and Health Insurance industry comprises companies providing workersâ compensation insurance, mainly to employers operating in hazardous industries. These companies offer group, individual or voluntary supplemental insurance products. Workers' compensation is a form of accident insurance paid by employers without affecting employeesâ pay.Claims are generally met by insurers or state-run workersâ compensation funds, benefiting both employers and employees. While it boosts employeesâ morale, and, in turn, productivity, employers stand to benefit from lower claims costs.As awareness about the benefits of having such coverage rises, the future of these insurers seems bright. Per reports published in IBISWorld, the U.S. workers' compensation insurance industry is estimated to grow 0.9% to $55 billion in 2023 based on revenues.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Accident &amp; Health Insurance IndustryPricing Pressure to Continue: The worker compensation industry has been witnessing pricing pressure over the past several quarters. Given this soft pricing, efforts to retain market share will increase pricing pressure, which might curb top-line growth. With commercial and industrial activities back on track, the demand for insurance coverage is likely to be on the rise. SpendEdge estimates workers compensation insurance pricing to increase at a five-year (2022-2026) CAGR of 5.25%. Per a report published in Business Insurance, this line of business should continue to remain profitable in 2023 while rates continue to trend downward.Story continuesClaims Frequency Might Rise: The accident and health insurance space has witnessed growth over the years, primarily driven by an increase in benefits offered by employers. The right kind of workersâ compensation policy translates into personal care for injured workers, increased productivity, higher employee morale, lower turnover, reduced claims costs and less financial worry amid rising medical costs.Increasing underwriting exposure, sustained decrease in claims frequency rates attributable to a better working environment and conservative reserve levels have been boosting the industryâs performance. Per U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data in an AmTrust Financial report, workers over the age of 55 will increase to about 25% in 2024 from 21.7% in 2014. Thus, claims could rise based on the magnitude of severity, the report states. Also, with business activities getting normal, claims may rise.Increasing Adoption of Technology: The industry is witnessing accelerated adoption of technology in operations. Telemedicine has gained pace amid the pandemic. Carriers started selling policies online that appealed to the tech-savvy population. Given the current pandemic, several organizations are working remotely to comply with social distancing norms. Electronic applications, e-signatures, electronic policy delivery, cloud computing and blockchain should help insurers gain a competitive edge. Nonetheless, higher spending on technological advancements will result in escalated expense ratios.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Rosy ProspectsThe groupâs Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects.

Shares have lost about 0.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Sherwin-Williams due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Sherwin-Williamsâ Q1 Earnings and Revenues Beat EstimatesSherwin-Williams recorded first-quarter 2023 earnings of $1.84 per share, reflecting a rise of 30.5% from the year-ago quarter's $1.41.The company posted adjusted earnings of $2.04 per share, up 26.7% from the year-ago quarter figure of $1.61. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84.The companyâs net sales in the first quarter were $5,442.4 million, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,147.6 million. Net sales increased 8.9% from $4,998.7 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The upside was driven by higher selling prices in all segments and increased architectural sales volumes in the Paint Stores Group segment, partly mitigated by lower sales volumes in the companyâs Consumer Brands Group and Performance Coatings Group units.Segment HighlightsPaint Stores Group: Net sales from this segment were $2,859.1 million in the first quarter, up 14.8% from the year-ago quarter. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher selling prices and a rise in sales volume in all end markets. Profit increased as higher prices and a rise in paint sales volumes were partly offset by continued investments in long-term growth strategies and increased employee-related costs in the quarter.Consumer Brands Group: Net sales from this segment were $872.7 million in the first quarter, up 2.4% from the year-ago quarter. The increase in sales is primarily due to selling price rise and strong growth within Latin America, partly offset by reduced sales volumes in all other regions.Performance Coatings Group: Net sales from this segment were $1,709.8 million in the first quarter, up 3.4% from the year-ago quarter. The upside was mainly supported by higher selling prices in all end markets and incremental sales from acquisitions but was partly offset by lower sales volume in Asia and Europe. Higher selling prices offset by increased costs related to employees led to a rise in segment profits.Story continuesFinancialsAt the end of the first quarter, Sherwin-Williams had cash and cash equivalents of $151.4 million, down around 62% year over year.

Shares have lost about 10.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Universal Health Services due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Universal Health Q1 Earnings Beat on Higher AdmissionsUniversal Health Services reported first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.34, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.8% and our estimate of $2.14. Additionally, the bottom line grew 8.8% year over year.Net revenues of Universal Health advanced 5.3% year over year to $3,468 million in the quarter under review. The top line beat the consensus mark by 1.3% and our estimate of $3,415.5 million.The strong quarterly results of UHS were supported by improved patient admissions at its acute care and behavioral healthcare facilities as well as rising patient days. However, the upside was partly offset by an elevated expense level.Quarterly Operational UpdateAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation &amp; amortization (EBITDA), net of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (NCI), amounted to $421.1 million. The metric does not consider the impact of the provision for asset impairment and other (income) expenses, net. The figure improved 11% year over year and outpaced our estimate of $387.6 million.Total operating costs escalated 4.2% year over year to $3,188.8 million in the first quarter. This was mainly due to increased salaries, wages and benefits, other operating expenses, supplies, lease and rental expenses. The continued shortage of nurses and other medical personnel throughout the United States kept the company under pressure.Story continuesSegmental UpdateAcute Care Hospital ServicesAdjusted admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) grew 10.5% year over year on a same-facility basis in the quarter under review, while adjusted patient days increased 3.7% year over year. Net revenues derived from Universal Healthâs acute care services witnessed a 3.5% year-over-year uptick on a same-facility basis.Behavioral Health Care ServicesIn the first quarter, adjusted admissions increased 7.5% year over year on a same-facility basis. Adjusted patient days advanced 4.7% year over year. Net revenues stemming from the behavioral healthcare services of UHS rose 9.7% year over year.Financial Update (as of Mar 31, 2023)Universal Health exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $110 million, which increased from $102.8 million at 2022-end.As part of the $1.2-billion revolving credit facility of UHS, net of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, there remains an aggregate available borrowing capacity of $875 million at the first-quarter end.Total assets of $13,556 million increased from $13,494.2 million at 2022-end.Long-term debt amounted to $4,707.3 million, down from $4,726.5 million at 2022-end. Short-term debt was at $96.2 million.Total equity of $6,052.4 million rose 1.5% from the figure at 2022-end.In the first quarter of 2023, net cash provided by operating activities declined 34.7% from the 2022-end level to $290.8 million. The plunge in this metric was caused by unfavorable other working capital accounts.Share Repurchase UpdateUniversal Health bought back shares worth roughly $78.7 million in the first quarter. It had leftover funds of around $869 million under its repurchase authorization as of Mar 31, 2023.2023 GuidanceEarlier management provided guidance for net revenues between $14,044 million and $14,314 million. This indicates an improvement of around 4.8%-6.8% from the 2022 figure of $13,399.4 million.Adjusted EBITDA, net of NCI, was earlier anticipated in the band of $1,662-$1,753 million, the midpoint of which suggests 2.7% growth from the 2022 figure of $1,662 million.UHS projected adjusted EPS in the range of $9.50-$10.50 for 2023, the midpoint of which implies 1.2% growth from the 2022 figure of $9.88.Depreciation and amortization were estimated at $594.4 million. Interest expenses were projected at around $198 million. Capital expenditures were expected within $725 and $875 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresCurrently, Universal Health Services has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a B.

The necessary upgrade and maintenance of the water tanks will assist the company to protect water quality and increase the effective service life of the storage tanks.The Pennsylvanian unit has been upgrading and maintaining its water and wastewater infrastructure by replacing old water mains methodically and has invested nearly $490 million in 2022 for infrastructure upgrades. Proper infrastructure maintenance allows the company to serve its 2.3 million customers more efficiently.Upgrades Essential for Water IndustryA substantial portion of water and wastewater infrastructure in the U.S. has aged and is nearing the end of its effective service life. Miles of aging pipelines essentially require repairs and upgrades to maintain quality water service. A delay in repair could cause frequent disruptions in the 24x7 supply of potable water and sewer services.Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, investments of $473 billion and $271 billion are necessary to maintain and expand drinking water and wastewater pipelines, respectively, to meet demand over the next 20 years. Water infrastructures, like storage tanks and purifying units, need maintenance at proper intervals.Utilities Making Systematic InvestmentGiven the above-mentioned scenario, it is evident that systematic investments to upgrade and maintain the old infrastructure, as well as making provisions for adding new infrastructure, will assist the operators in meeting the rising customer demand. Water utilities are making systematic investments to replace and upgrade their aging infrastructure. The U.S. government is also providing funds to upgrade and maintain the same.American Water Works aims to invest in the range of $14-$15 billion in the 2023-2027 period and $30-$34 billion for the 10-year period of 2023-2032.

Last month, the cost of food overall was up 7.7%. Groceries, in particular, were up 7.1%.Examples: Hot dogs and poultry cost more year-over-year, up 2.2% and up 5.0% respectively. Meanwhile, uncooked ground beef saw a decline of 2.1% compared to last year. Still, it's higher compared to the month prior, up 0.6%. On average, ground beef costs $4.65 per pound last month. That's only slightly lower than last year, which was approximately $4.70 per pound, but higher than the $3.96 figure back in 2020.Beef inflation was brought higher after a drought impacted cattle supply, said Michael Swanson, Wells Fargo's chief agricultural economist, and it will take a few years to fully recover. However, it is unclear what is driving inflation for hot dogs and poultry.Spices, seasonings, condiments, sauces? They'll cost more too, up 10.3% year-over-year, as consumer product goods companies like Kraft Heinz (KHC) lap price increases. In Q4, Kraft Heinz's prices were 15.2 percentage points higher than the same time period a year prior. The price of hot dog and hamburger buns are higher too. On a yearly basis, prices for bakery products are up 12.9% with white bread driving the cost higher, up 14.3%. For a pound of white bread, it will cost $1.96. That's the highest price ever recorded, per BLS records, which date back to 1980. If you're looking to bring dessert, there's bad news on that price front too. Cakes, cupcakes, and cookies were up 14.1%. Cookies alone were up a whopping 15.9%.There's also bad news for side dishes. ""Sweet corn... that's really a very seasonal market.

Shares have lost about 1.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PepsiCo due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.PepsiCo Q1 Earnings &amp; Revenues Beat EstimatesPepsiCo has reported robust first-quarter 2023 results, wherein revenues and earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate. The top and bottom lines also improved year over year. The companyâs strong results reflect gains from strength and resilience in its diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems, and robust consumer demand trends.The company also gained from the resilience and strength in the global beverage and convenient food businesses. The company has raised its view for 2023.PepsiCoâs first-quarter core EPS of $1.50 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37 and our estimate of $1.36. Core EPS also increased 16.3% year over year. In constant currency, core earnings were up 18% from the year-ago period, backed by the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives. The companyâs reported EPS of $1.40 declined 54% year over year in the quarter. Adverse currency rates impacted EPS by 2% in the quarter.Net revenues of $17,846 million improved 10.2% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17,199 million and our estimate of $16,929 million. Revenues benefited from robust price/mix in the reported quarter. Unit volume declined 3% year over year for the convenient food business and was up 1% year over year for the beverage business. Foreign currency impacted revenues by 2.5%.On an organic basis, revenues grew 14.3% year over year, driven by broad-based growth across categories and geographies. This marked the sixth straight quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth for the company. The consolidated organic volume was down 2%, while effective net pricing improved 16% in the first quarter. Pricing gains were driven by strong realized prices across all segments.Improvements across categories resulted from accelerated growth in the global beverage and convenient food businesses, reflecting strength in its diversified portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, organic revenues grew 12% for the beverage business and 16% for the convenient food business. Region-wise, organic revenues improved 14% and 15%, respectively, in North America and International businesses.On a consolidated basis, the reported gross profit increased 12.4% year over year to $9,858 million. The core gross profit rose 11.2% year over year to $9,871 million. The reported gross margin expanded 112 basis points (bps), while the core gross margin expanded 51 bps.The reported operating income of $2,629 million declined 50% year over year. The core operating income rose 17.1% year over year to $2,802 million and the core constant-currency operating income improved 19%. The reported operating margin declined 1,778 bps to 14.7% from 32.5% in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, the core operating margin expanded 93 bps due to ongoing productivity initiatives, offset by a double-digit increase in advertising and marketing expenses.Story continuesSegmental DetailsThe company witnessed revenue growth across all segments, except for APAC. Organic revenues improved for all segments.Revenues, on a reported basis, improved 15% in FLNA, 9% in QFNA, 8% in PBNA, 21% in Latin America, 5% in Europe and 2% in AMESA. However, revenues declined 1% in APAC in the first quarter. Organic revenues increased 16% each for FLNA and Latin America, 10% for QFNA, 12% for PBNA, 14% for Europe, 29% for AMESA and 4% for APAC.Â Operating profit (on a reported basis) increased 23% for FLNA, 18% for QFNA, 13% for Latin America and 5.5% for APAC. However, it declined 86% for PBNA and 6% for AMESA.FinancialsThe company ended first-quarter 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $4,770 million, long-term debt of $37,486 million, and shareholdersâ equity (excluding non-controlling interest) of $17,042 million. Net cash used in operating activities was $392 million as of Mar 25, 2023, compared with $174 million used as of Mar 19, 2023.OutlookPepsiCo raised its revenue and earnings guidance for 2023. The company expects organic revenue growth of 8% for 2023 compared with the 6% rise mentioned earlier. It anticipates core constant-currency earnings per share to increase 9% from the year-ago periodâs reported figure versus 8% growth stated earlier. PEP expects currency headwinds to hurt revenues and core earnings per share by 2 percentage points in 2023, based on the current rates. The company expects a core effective tax rate of 20% for 2023.Based on the above assumption, PepsiCo expects its core earnings per share to be $7.27 for 2023 compared with $7.20 per share mentioned earlier. This suggests a 7% increase from the core EPS of $6.79 reported in 2022 compared with 6% growth expected earlier.PepsiCo has been committed to rewarding shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. It expects to return value worth $7.7 billion in 2023, including $6.7 billion of dividends. Additionally, the company plans to repurchase shares worth $1.0 billion in 2023.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresAt this time, PepsiCo has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced updated data from two Phase 2 expansion dose cohorts evaluating investigational linvoseltamab (formerly REGN5458) in patients with heavily pre-treated, relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma. The results will be shared in an oral session at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and the LINKER-MM1 trial will form the basis of planned submissions to regulatory authorities, including to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later this year. Linvoseltamab is an investigational BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody designed to bridge B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) on multiple myeloma cells with CD3-expressing T cells to facilitate T-cell activation and cancer-cell killing.âDespite advances, new treatments are needed that drive meaningful and durable responses to help patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma,â said Hans Lee, M.D., Associate Professor and Director, Multiple Myeloma Clinical Research at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. âTreatment with linvoseltamab at the recommended 200 mg dose in the LINKER-MM1 trial demonstrated impressive efficacy, with rapid, deep and durable responses in patients with multiple myeloma thatâs highly refractory to standard therapies. Moreover, less than half of patients experienced any grade cytokine release syndrome, which was mostly Grade 1, with some Grade 2 and a single Grade 3 case. This reinforces the potential of linvoseltamab as a promising treatment option.âStory continuesThe new data to be presented at ASCO 2023 are from patients treated in the 50 mg (n=104) and 200 mg (n=117) cohorts of the Phase 1/2 trial. Initial results were presented at the 64th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2022. Among the 200 mg cohort, the median soluble BCMA (sBCMA) was 377 ng/mL, 22% had bone marrow plasma cells â¥50% and 36% had high-risk cytogenetics, representing a patient population with a high disease burden and poor prognosis. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) assessed by independent review committee, which will be available when the data are more mature. The secondary endpoints included ORR and other efficacy measures assessed by local investigator. With a median follow-up of 6 months, patients receiving the recommended 200 mg dose showed:71% ORR, per local investigator.59% achieved a very good partial response (VGPR) or better, with 30% achieving a complete response (CR) or stringent complete response (sCR), per local investigator. Based on earlier results, responses may deepen with longer follow-up.Median time to onset of response was less than 1 month.84% and 79% probability of maintaining a response at 6 and 12 months, respectively, per Kaplan-Meier estimates.Median progression-free survival was not reached.Strong efficacy per ORR was consistently observed in the 200 mg cohort across multiple subgroups, even in high risk patients such as adults â¥75 years of age (n=31; 68%), patients with International Staging System (ISS) stage II and III disease (n=44 and 22; 73% and 59% respectively), patients with extramedullary plasmacytomas (defined as disease without bone association, n=16; 56%) as well as patients with baseline sBCMA â¥400 ng/mL (n=51; 55%). Additionally, among patients treated with 50 mg and 200 mg that achieved CR or sCR with available minimal residual disease (MRD) data, 54% were MRD negative at 10-5.No new safety signals were identified with longer follow-up in the Phase 1 or Phase 2 portions of the trial. Among all patients in the 200 mg cohort, 79% experienced Grade â¥3 adverse events (AE). Most commonly occurring AEs (in â¥20% of patients) were cytokine release syndrome (CRS; 45%), neutropenia, cough, fatigue and diarrhea (33% each), anemia (27%), arthralgia (26%), and headache (23%). Discontinuations due to an AE occurred in 16% of patients. Deaths due to treatment-emergent AEs, on-treatment or within 30 days post last dose, in the 200 mg cohort were reported in 6 patients. None of the deaths were considered related to treatment per the treating physician. Among the 200 mg cohort, the majority of CRS cases were mild or moderate, there was a single case of Grade 3 CRS, and no cases of â¥Grade 4 CRS. The median time to first CRS onset was 15 hours (range: 0-177 hours), with the median time to resolution within 1 day (17 hours; range: 1-144 hours). Among the 50 mg and 200 mg dose cohorts (n=221), there were 14 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome events (ICANS, 6% all Grades; 2% Grades 3-4).âWith these latest pivotal results, linvoseltamab demonstrated notable response rates, providing encouraging evidence for this bispecific antibody,â said L. Andres Sirulnik, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational and Clinical Sciences, Hematology at Regeneron. âWe designed linvoseltamab with patient needs at the center and are proud that it has provided benefit across the spectrum of relapsed refractory multiple myeloma patients, even those with hard-to-treat disease. We look forward to sharing these data with regulatory authorities with the goal of bringing this medicine to patients with heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma as soon as possible.âBased on these data, the Phase 3 development program investigating linvoseltamab in earlier stages of the disease has been initiated. In the U.S., linvoseltamab has been granted Fast Track Designation for multiple myeloma by the FDA. Linvoseltamab is currently under clinical development, and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Phase 1/2 TrialThe ongoing, open-label, multicenter Phase 1/2 dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial is investigating linvoseltamab in patients with R/R multiple myeloma. Among the 282 patients enrolled, all have received at least three prior lines of therapy or are triple refractory. Patients were administered linvoseltamab utilizing a step-up dosing regimen that was designed to help mitigate CRS.The Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the trial, which is now complete, primarily assessed safety, tolerability and dose-limiting toxicities across 9 dose levels of linvoseltamab exploring different administration regimens. The fully-enrolled Phase 2 dose expansion portion of the trial is further assessing the safety and anti-tumor activity of linvoseltamab, with a primary objective of ORR. Key secondary objectives include duration of response, progression free survival, rate of minimal residual disease negative status and overall survival.About Multiple MyelomaMultiple myeloma is the second most common blood cancer. Globally, there were 176,404 new diagnoses in 2020 and 35,730 new diagnoses estimated for 2023 in the U.S. It is characterized by the proliferation of cancerous plasma cells (multiple myeloma cells) that crowd out healthy blood cells in the bone marrow, infiltrate other tissues and cause potentially life-threatening organ injury. Multiple myeloma is not curable despite treatment advances, and while current treatments are able to slow the progression of the cancer, most patients will ultimately experience cancer progression and require additional therapies. In addition, patients are at increased risk of frequent infections, bone fracture and pain, reduced kidney function, and anemia.About Regeneron in HematologyAt Regeneron, weâre applying more than three decades of biology expertise with our proprietary VelociSuiteÂ® technologies to develop medicines for patients with diverse blood cancers and rare blood disorders.Our blood cancer research is focused on bispecific antibodies that are being investigated both as monotherapies and in combination with each other and emerging therapeutic modalities.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced positive data from three independent cohorts evaluating an investigational combination of LAG-3 inhibitor fianlimab and PD-1 inhibitor LibtayoÂ®Â (cemiplimab) in adults with advanced melanoma. The early clinical trial results, which demonstrated the combination led to clinically meaningful and durable results across multiple clinical settings, will be shared in an oral session at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago on Monday, June 5 at 3:00 PM CT.âLAG-3 inhibitors are known to complement PD-1 inhibitors in the treatment of advanced melanoma. There exists an unmet need to further improve the benefit to patients, including those with liver metastases and other high-risk prognostic markers,â saidÂ Omid Hamid, M.D., Director, Clinical Research and Immunotherapy at The Angeles Clinic and Research Institute, and principal investigator of the trial. âThese updated and independent expansion cohort results reinforce the potential of the fianlimab and cemiplimab (Libtayo) combination to deliver clinically meaningful and durable responses in diverse clinical settings and patient populations, with an acceptable safety profile. Particularly encouraging is that the clinical activity was observed in post hoc analyses of patient subgroups, including in patients with a poor prognosis or those who had been previously treated with an anti-PD-1 therapy in the adjuvant setting.âStory continuesThe data to be presented at ASCO 2023 include findings from three independent expansion cohorts of adults with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who were all naÃ¯ve to anti-PD-1 therapy for advanced disease (n=98). Additional follow up will be reported on an initial cohort of first- or second-line patients (n=40) and a confirmatory cohort of first-line patients (n=40), previously reported at ESMO 2022. New for this presentation is a cohort of patients who had received prior systemic treatment for melanoma in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting (n=18), including adjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy (n=13 of 18).Tumor responses were based on RECIST 1.1 criteria and per investigator assessment. The median duration of response (DOR) was not reached in any cohort, and the objective response rate (ORR) by cohort was as follows:Initial cohort: 63% (25 of 40 patients), including 6 complete responses (CR) and 19 partial responses (PR).Confirmatory cohort: 63% (25 of 40 patients), including 5 CRs and 20 PRs.Prior neo/adjuvant systemic therapy cohort: 56% (10 of 18 patients). Among the 13 patients in this latest cohort who had prior anti-PD-1 adjuvant treatment, the ORR was 62% (8 of 13 patients), including 1 CR and 7 PRs.In a post hoc analysis of the three combined cohorts, the ORR was 61% (60 of 98 patients), the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 15 months per Kaplan-Meier estimate (95% CI: 9âNE), and the median follow-up was 13 months (interquartile range 9-19). Additional post hoc analyses found clinically meaningful activity in multiple subgroups of interest, with ORRs in each as follows:Poor prognosis: 53% (17 of 32 patients) in cases with high baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 43% (9 of 21 patients) in cases of liver metastasis, and 35% (6 of 17 patients) in cases of M1c stage (visceral metastatic) disease and high baseline LDH.Varying tumor PD-L1 expression levels: 73% (19 of 26 patients) in cases of â¥1% PD-L1 expression and 56% (23 of 41 patients) in cases of &lt;1% PD-L1 expression.The safety profile of the fianlimab and Libtayo combination in these expansion cohorts appeared to be generally consistent with the safety profile of Libtayo monotherapy and other anti-PD-(L)1 agents, except for higher rates of adrenal insufficiency, which were â¤Grade 2 in the majority of cases (64%) and all cases were successfully managed with steroid replacement. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 94% of patients, with 44% being â¥Grade 3 and 30% considered serious. AEs occurring in â¥10% of patients included rash (20%), pruritis (16%), diarrhea (15%), arthralgia (13%), hypothyroidism (12%), adrenal insufficiency (11%) and myalgia (10%). The treatment discontinuation rate due to AEs was 16%.âFianlimab in combination with Libtayo has now demonstrated robust response rates in three independent advanced melanoma cohorts â each with unique patient populations,â said Israel Lowy, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational and Clinical Sciences, Oncology at Regeneron. âThese positive results support the clinical potential of fianlimab in combination with Libtayo. We look forward to partnering with the oncology community to further investigate this combination in a broad pivotal clinical development program that includes Phase 3 trials in the advanced and adjuvant melanoma settings, alongside ongoing Phase 2/3 trials in non-small cell lung cancer and research in other solid tumors.âAdditional presentations on the fianlimab and Libtayo combination will be shared at ASCO during a poster session on Saturday, June 3 from 1:15 to 4:15 PM CT, including:A Phase 1 study of fianlimab (anti-LAG-3) in combination with cemiplimab (anti-PD-1) in patients with advanced melanoma: poor prognosis subgroup analysis (#9548)A Phase 3 trial of fianlimab (anti-LAG-3) plus cemiplimab (anti-PD-1) versus pembrolizumab in patients with previously untreated unresectable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma (#TPS9602)A Phase 3 trial comparing fianlimab (anti-LAG-3) plus cemiplimab (anti-PD-1) to pembrolizumab in patients with completely resected high-risk melanoma (#TPS9598)The potential use of fianlimab and Libtayo described above is investigational, and safety and efficacy of this combination have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Regeneronâs Approach to Cancer Research At Regeneron, weâre applying more than three decades of scientific innovation with the goal of developing paradigm-changing therapies for patients with cancer.Our portfolio is built around two foundational approaches â our approved PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo and investigational bispecific antibodies â which are being evaluated both as monotherapies and in combination with emerging therapeutic modalities. Together, they provide us with unique combinatorial flexibility to develop potentially synergistic treatments for a wide range of solid tumors and blood cancers.If you are interested in learning more about our clinical trials, please contact us (clinicaltrials@regeneron.comÂ or 844-734-6643) or visit our clinical trialsÂ website.About the Phase 1 Trial The Phase 1 trial is a first-in-human, multi-cohort study investigating fianlimab in combination with Libtayo in patients with advanced melanoma. The primary endpoint is ORR per RECIST 1.1 criteria; secondary endpoints include PFS, DOR, disease control rate (DCR), safety and pharmacokinetics (PK).In these three expansion cohorts, 98 patients were enrolled and received fianlimab 1600 mg and Libtayo 350 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 51 weeks, with a median follow up of 12.6 months and median treatment duration of 32.9 weeks. Additional analyses from the Phase 1 trial are ongoing.About fianlimabFianlimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor LAG-3 on T cells and was invented using Regeneronâs proprietary VelocImmuneÂ®Â technology. In melanoma, LAG-3 expression on cancer cells is associated with therapeutic resistance to PD-1 inhibitors. Fianlimab is being investigated in combination with Regeneron's PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo to determine whether concurrent blockade of LAG-3 and PD-1 can help overcome this resistance and release the brakes on T cell activation.About LibtayoLibtayo is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T cells and was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmuneÂ® technology. By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation. In theÂ U.S.Â and other countries Libtayo is indicated in certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC), advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and advanced NSCLC, as well as in advanced cervical cancer inÂ theÂ European Union, Canada andÂ Brazil. As ofÂ July 1, 2022, Libtayo is developed and marketed globally by Regeneron.In theÂ U.S., the generic name for Libtayo in its approvedÂ indications is cemiplimab-rwlc, with rwlc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by theÂ U.S. Food and Drug AdministrationÂ (FDA). Outside of theÂ U.S., the generic name of Libtayo in its approved indication is cemiplimab.The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. Libtayo is currently being investigated in trials as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with either conventional or novel therapeutic approaches for other solid tumors and blood cancers.Â These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S.Â FDA-approved IndicationsÂ Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat:People with a type of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) that has spread or cannot be cured by surgery or radiation.People with a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma (BCC) when your BCC cannot be removed by surgery (locally advanced BCC) or when it has spread (metastatic BCC) and have received treatment with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI), or cannot receive treatment with a HHI.Adults with a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).LIBTAYO may be used in combination with chemotherapy that contains a platinum medicine as your first treatment when your lung cancer has not spread outside your chest (locally advanced lung cancer) and you cannot have surgery or chemotherapy with radiation, or your lung cancer has spread to other areas of your body (metastatic lung cancer), and your tumor does not have an abnormal âEGFR,â âALK,â or âROS1â gene.LIBTAYO may be used alone as your first treatment when your lung cancer has not spread outside your chest (locally advanced lung cancer) and you cannot have surgery or chemotherapy with radiation, or your lung cancer has spread to other areas of your body (metastatic lung cancer), and your tumor tests positive for high âPD-L1,â and your tumor does not have an abnormal âEGFR,â âALK,â or âROS1â gene.It is not known if Libtayo is safe and effective in children.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FORÂ U.S.Â PATIENTSWhat is the most important information I should know about LIBTAYO?LIBTAYO is a medicine that may treat certain cancers by working with your immune system.

MartinThank you, Cammeron, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Consistent with what you've heard from us over the last few quarters, we continue to take the necessary actions to drive critical change at Gap Inc. to further improve the trajectory of our business and to get us back on a path toward delivering consistent results. We are improving near-term execution and requiring a much deeper and integrated focus on the customer to unleash each brand's potential, also simplifying our operating structure and model, reducing costs, improving speed of decision-making and unlocking our creative muscle and modernizing our core capabilities that have been on Gap Inc.'s road map for far too long. I understand that we have surfaced these issues before, and what I would say is simply this work has been derailed for far too long, and it is imperative that we get after it in earnest. The need for change is permeating the organization, and I am very pleased that our teams are embracing the work and behaviors needed to get us there. The leadership team is committed to getting the work done and have put structure, process and leadership accountability in place to ensure that we do.Now let me give you a little more specific insight to the actions that we have been taking. First, we took immediate action to improve our near-term execution and brand performance. We have moved quickly and effectively at clearing excess inventory, improving assortment, particularly at Old Navy and Gap, resulting in share gains in both women's and baby in Q1. The company delivered over 600 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion compared to last year, driven by significantly improved gross margin from the reduction of excessive air freight expense and improved promotional activity as well as adjusted SG&amp;A leverage. And our balance sheet is stronger.We ended the first quarter with nearly 40% more cash than last year, almost 30% less inventory than last year, and we paid off $100 million of our outstanding ABL balance just last week while also continuing to deliver an attractive quarterly dividend to our shareholders.Now let me speak to each of our brands. Starting with Old Navy, comparable sales were down 1%. Old Navy's momentum continued into the first quarter with market share gains driven by strength in women's as well as a reversal of trend in the baby business that was offset by softness in active and kids. The Old Navy team under Haio Barbeito's leadership remain focused on stabilizing the core and elevating execution, which contributed to improved margins resulting from its leaner inventory position and balanced assortments. Styles with a clear fashion point of view and diversified end use like woven tops and pants performed well, giving customers the option to go from casual to dressed up thanks to outfitting cues focused on versatility. The team also continues to lean into its responsive capabilities in order to place inventory buys more efficiently and remain flexible to chase into demand or pivot if the customer needs shift.On Gap Brand, comparable sales were up 1%, driven by continued strength in women's, a modest improvement in baby and offset by weakness in kids and active. Gap Brand's focus on amplifying its icons is truly resonating as the team focuses on reintroducing the most modern versions of its iconic styles. This shows up as updating styles like our women's silver faux leather jean and on-trend take on our classic cheeky straight denim offering. And I'm encouraged by product improvement in other categories as well, including denim, woven tops and dresses, which showed up with increased versatility. The team uses responsive levers to chase in the best-selling women's denim like the Baby Boot and high-rise stride as well as trending woven tops, further driving growth in these categories.Moving to Banana Republic. Comparable sales were down 8% on top of an outsized positive 27% comp last year. While still early on its journey, Banana Republic continues to make progress establishing itself as a premium lifestyle brand and is resonating with our customers. This March, it unveiled BR Home with a curated collection of rugs, bedding, decor and more, all capitalizing on the BR customers' appreciation for great style, design and quality. And leveraging the deep home lifestyle talent and expertise of the Banana Republic leadership team, we look forward to more expanded collection in the future. And finally, Athleta, which posted comparable sales of negative 13%, which were below plan for the quarter. As we discussed last quarter, Athleta's near-term performance was negatively impacted by continued product acceptance challenges, including color, print and pattern misses and from straying too far from its performance DNA. Delivering the best product for our customers is the highest priority, and while the team is focused on making improvements in the assortment, we know it will take time for those changes to fully take hold.While we continue our search for a new leader for Athleta, we are leveraging the great talent currently at the brand, including our new Chief Creative Officer, Julia Leach, as well as some of our best merchandising and product talent from across our portfolio of brands. Collectively, they are leaning in and making improvements where we can, including better presentation of the product that is working, and elevating our marketing and creative expression.And across Gap Inc., we are still watching the channel shifts closely. While online sales were down single digits in Q1, they are up close to 40% from pre-pandemic levels in Q1 of 2019. As the consumer continues to shift back to stores, we remain focused on delivering the optimal omni experience for our customers across all brands and all channels. Second, we've made significant change to our organizational structure and are actively improving our operating model to unlock period of muscle, heightened accountability and empower talent by removing bureaucracy, complexity and outdated processes while also reducing cost.These changes are pivotal in restoring our strengths and priority around design, innovation, style and trend. We flattened the organization by reducing layers from 12 to 8 and increasing the average span of control from 2 people to 4, still with the intent of getting to 5 or better, informed by best-in-class benchmarks, all of this to address execution inefficiency and improve decision-making quality and speed.Each of our brands now have consistent structures built around our product, our customer and our creative excellence with clear road maps and mandates. We believe this work will ultimately show up in improvements in our sales and margin performance over the long term and again, most importantly, in creative and product execution.Fundamental shifts included combining merchandising and inventory management under one leader to oversee the end-to-end process fueled by consumer insights; bringing channels together under the commerce and experience lead to drive omni-thinking in the end-to-end consumer experience and splitting marketing leadership into 2 roles, 1 focused on creative and brand identity, and 1 focused on execution and analytics. And we have also centralized G&amp;A functions that were previously embedded in the brands to create efficiencies and better leverage scale and expertise of our portfolio. These changes result in eliminating approximately 1,800 positions and when combined with our earlier actions last fall, reflect approximately 25% of our headquarter roles, a significant contributor to nearly $550 million in estimated annualized savings on a cumulative basis.I know we all can understand, these decisions are always very, very difficult to make, especially when saying goodbye to team members that we care about. Beyond these organizational changes, the bigger payback will come when we show up as a more informed, faster and more creative company, delivering brand and cultural relevance to our customers.We have organized not just to improve the cost structure of this company but with an eye toward best-in-class industry standards and setting ourselves up to deliver long-term results. To be clear, this is not a one-and-done cost-cutting exercise. We are after a mindset and cultural shift that will be part of our evolution as we go forward. The teams are now in place, and in consistent pursuit of efficiency, we will continue to look at additional opportunities to rationalize our technology and marketing investments and exploring ways to further optimize our cost structure longer term. More to come as the team gets in deeper into this work.Thirdly, we are modernizing our capabilities to build a healthier company at the core and ultimately change the trajectory of our business. Through these improved capabilities, we are focused on key product and market functions, including reestablishing core merchandising processes and pricing architectures, amplifying and leveraging customer insights and analytics and leaning in further to our vendor partners and our product development processes as we further elevate our responsive capabilities.Lastly, to bring leadership, structure and accountability to ensure we drive this work to completion, we have put a transformation office in place under the Gap Inc. leadership team, and we've engaged external consulting partners to even further drive rigor, processes and day-to-day discipline to support the team through this period of significant change. We have also aligned a significant portion of our incentive compensation this year to the achievement and completion of our cost transformation efforts. Our leaders and our teams are committed to this change, and I'm proud of the progress to date.And finally, before I turn the call to Katrina, I want to address our CEO search and the comments made by our Lead Independent Director, Mayo Shattuck, in our earnings press release today. When I took the role of interim CEO in July, I did not expect to still be speaking to you on our first quarter earnings call, but this only underscores how strongly the Board is committed to appointing the right person as our next CEO, one who has passion, strong vision and customer obsession that will take this company forward. We are deeply engaged toward the appointment, and look forward to the time we will introduce you to the new CEO of Gap Inc. Let me move us on, but I hope this provided a bit more clarity around our commitment to shoring up the foundation of this company for the long term by lowering our cost structure, building a culture of creativity and empowerment and reorienting our business toward the customer. These types of foundational changes pave the way for a future CEO to take over a business that is healthier, more productive and ready to compete and win.And with that, Katrina, I'll pass it over to you.Katrina O'ConnellThank you, Bobby, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. The actions we are taking to significantly reduce excess inventory, improve category and assortment balance, transform and optimize our operating structure and significantly reduce operating expenses while further fortifying our balance sheet have allowed us to enter fiscal 2023 better positioned.During the first quarter, we delivered net sales in line with our expectations driven by continued women's category strength at Gap and Old Navy despite the weaker sales at Athleta, over 600 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion as we drove down excessive airfreight expense and delivered significantly improved promotional activity, most notably at Old Navy, and leveraged adjusted SG&amp;A, reduced inventory down over 27% year-over-year, which was only up 3% versus first quarter 2019 and ended the quarter with cash and equivalents up 38% from last year to nearly $1.2 billion.While we believe we are making progress to better position our model to deliver for the long term, we continue to take a prudent approach in planning and managing our business in light of what continues to be an uncertain macro and consumer environment. We remain focused on the levers and opportunities in our control to deliver on behalf of our customers, employees and shareholders.Let me start now with our first quarter results. First quarter net sales of $3.3 billion decreased 6% versus last year and were consistent with our expectations for first quarter sales to be down mid-single digits. As a reminder, the sale of Gap China at the beginning of the first quarter had a 2 point negative impact to net sales growth, and there was also a 1 point foreign exchange headwind. Excluding Gap China sales of approximately $60 million from Q1 last year and the foreign exchange headwind, total company net sales would have been down 3%.Comparable sales were down 3% in the first quarter. Store sales decreased 4% from the prior year. Online sales decreased 9% versus last year and were up 39% compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. Online represented 37% of total sales in the first quarter.Turning to sales by brand, starting with Old Navy. Sales in the first quarter of $1.8 billion were down 1% from last year. Compared to 2019, Old Navy sales were up 2% in the quarter. Although we believe Old Navy continues to experience demand softness from its lower income consumers, we're pleased to deliver first quarter comparable sales down 1%, which was a continued improvement from fiscal 2022, driven by strength in women's and a modest improvement in baby, offset by continued softness in active and kids. Old Navy continued to gain share in the quarter, driven largely by market share gains in women's and the kids and baby category. We continue to believe that Old Navy remains well positioned given its value positioning in the marketplace.Gap Brand total sales were $692 million. Excluding the 8 point negative impact related to the sale of Gap China, the 3 point negative impact from foreign exchange headwinds and the 1 point negative impact due to the shutdown of Yeezy Gap, sales were down 1% versus last year, largely driven by store closures in North America. Gap Brand comparable sales were up 1%, driven by continued strength in women's, a modest improvement in baby, offset by continued weakness in active and kids. Gap Brand continued to gain market share in women's as reinvented icons are resonating with consumers. Banana Republic sales were $432 million in the first quarter with comparable sales down 8% on top of a positive 27% comp last year. While the transformation of BR into an elevated lifestyle brand continues to take hold and resonate, the brand is lapping outsized growth last year, driven by post-COVID shift in consumer preferences, which is impacting year-over-year growth.Athleta sales of $321 million were down 11% from the prior year or an increase of 45% compared to 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Comparable sales were down 13%. As we told you last quarter, Athleta has had product acceptance challenges, which we believe are impacting results. While we know it will take at least a few quarters to make meaningful changes to the assortment, the team has been at work to improve product presentation and creative with an emphasis on the performance DNA that Athleta is known for.Now to gross margin in the first quarter. Reported gross margin was 37.1%. Adjusted gross margin increased 570 basis points to 37.2%. Merchandise margin on an adjusted basis increased 610 basis points. This was driven by approximately 560 basis points of leverage as we lapped last year's elevated airfreight and drove our normalized air expense down, approximately 330 basis points of deleverage due to inflationary cost headwinds as we are now selling product locked in at last year's peak cotton prices. This was slightly better than the 360 basis point headwind we anticipated as we are beginning to benefit from better ocean freights and the remaining 380 basis points of leverage stemming primarily from improved promotional activity relative to last year, primarily at Old Navy. ROD, as a percentage of sales deleveraged 40 basis points versus last year. Now let me turn to SG&amp;A. Reported SG&amp;A in the quarter was $1.2 billion, including a $47 million gain related to the sale of our One Harrison office building, offset by $71 million in restructuring charges related to actions to optimize our operating structure, including the reduction of approximately 1,800 corporate and upper field roles. As we discussed last quarter, the actions we are taking to optimize our operating model and structure are expected to result in annualized savings of $300 million, of which half we estimate to benefit SG&amp;A in the second half of fiscal 2023 and the remainder in the first half of fiscal 2024.Adjusted SG&amp;A of $1.2 billion was down 7% from last year. As a percentage of total sales, adjusted SG&amp;A leveraged 60 basis points, driven by lower advertising expense and lower technology investments resulting from our cost saving actions late last year. Reported operating income was a loss of $10 million. Adjusted operating income, which excludes restructuring charges and the gain on sale, was $18 million in the first quarter. Adjusted operating margin improved 620 basis points from last year to 0.5% in the quarter, driven by the 570 basis point improvement in adjusted gross margin and 60 basis points of adjusted SG&amp;A leverage. Reported EPS was a loss of $0.05. Adjusted EPS, which excludes restructuring charges and the gain on sale, was $0.01. Share count ended at 368 million.Turning to balance sheet and cash flow. Starting with inventory. Ending inventories declined 27% in the first quarter versus last year. This includes a 17 percentage point benefit related to in-transit as we lapped the prior year supply chain challenges and 4 percentage points of decline related to pack and hold inventory. The remaining decline is primarily driven by a decrease in fashion and seasonal basic inventory. As you know, we made significant progress rightsizing inventories as we exited fiscal 2022. We remain focused in fiscal 2023 on moderating buys, leaning further into our responsive levers and continuing to integrate the inventory that was placed in pack and hold in fiscal 2022 into future assortments.As a result, we are planning for inventory to be down significantly more than sales as compared to fiscal 2022. Quarter-end cash and equivalents were nearly $1.2 billion, an increase of 38% from the prior year. Net cash from operating activities was $15 million in the quarter, driven primarily by improved inventory levels and leaner buys. Capital expenditures were $117 million. Consistent with typical first quarter seasonality, free cash flow was an outflow in the quarter of approximately $102 million. We remain confident that cash flow trends will continue to normalize throughout fiscal 2023. As we told you last quarter, we expect to be positioned to pay down the $350 million draw on our asset-backed line of credit this year. In fact, last week, we paid down $100 million and intend to pay down the remaining $250 million balance throughout the remainder of the year.We remain committed to delivering an attractive quarterly dividend as a core component of total shareholder returns. During the quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.15 per share, and on May 9, our Board approved maintaining that $0.15 dividend for the second quarter of fiscal 2023.Now turning to our outlook. We continue to take a prudent approach to planning in light of the continued uncertain consumer and macro environment. Starting with Q2, let me first provide an overview of factors impacting year-over-year sales comparisons in the second quarter. Gap China represented approximately $60 million in sales last year in Q2 and is expected to be an approximate 1 to 2 percentage point headwind to Gap Inc. for the quarter. We are assuming an estimated 1 point foreign exchange headwind in the second quarter. We are estimating total net sales in the second quarter to be down mid- to high single digits year-over-year, reflecting a range of outcomes based on what continues to be an uncertain macro and consumer environment.We expect gross margin improvement in the second quarter versus last year. Compared to the 36% adjusted gross margin in the second quarter last year, we anticipate an estimated 200 basis points of leverage as we lap last year's elevated airfreight and continue to drive lower normalized air expense; an estimated 200 basis points of deleverage due to inflationary cost headwinds, primarily cotton cost headwinds similar to Q1. We expect these inflationary headwinds to moderate and become a tailwind in the back half of the year as we benefit from lower commodity prices as well as improved ocean freight rates. This 200 basis point inflationary headwind is expected to be fully offset by improved promotional activity as a result of improved inventory positions relative to last year. And ROD is expected to delever by approximately 50 basis points compared to last year.We are planning for adjusted SG&amp;A of approximately $1.3 billion in the second quarter largely reflecting the continued benefit of last year's savings actions offset by higher incentive compensation. As discussed previously, we expect to begin to benefit in the back half of the year from $300 million in annualized savings related to the actions we are taking to optimize our operating model and structure that we began implementing last month.Now turning to full year 2023. As a reminder on the factors impacting year-over-year comparisons, Gap China represented approximately $300 million in net sales last year, representing an approximate 2 point headwind to Gap Inc. in fiscal 2023. Fiscal 2023 will have a 53rd week, estimated to add approximately $150 million to net sales or approximately 1 point of growth. As we look to the remainder of fiscal 2023, we continue to believe net sales could be down in the low to mid-single-digit range for the year.Turning to gross margin. Compared to the 35% adjusted gross margin in fiscal 2022, adjusted gross margin in fiscal 2023 is expected to be driven by an estimated 200 basis points of airfreight leverage as we lap last year's elevated airfreight and continue to drive down normalized air expense. Approximately 50 basis points of deleverage versus last year stemming from inflationary cost headwinds, this is an improvement from our prior expectations of a 100 basis point headwind as we are experiencing an improvement in ocean freight rates earlier than previously planned. We anticipate approximately 250 basis points of inflationary deleverage in the first half of the year, shifting to a tailwind of approximately 150 basis points of leverage in the back half as we benefit from improved commodity costs and ocean freight rates.We continue to expect more than 100 basis points of margin benefit in fiscal 2023 as a result of our better inventory position and expected improved promotional activity compared to last year. And ROD as a percentage of sales is planned to be roughly flat to down approximately 50 basis points compared to last year.We continue to target fiscal 2023 adjusted SG&amp;A to be down low to mid-single digits from the prior year or approximately $5.2 billion. As we communicated last quarter, the higher incentive compensation and wage inflation plan for fiscal 2023 is expected to be fully offset by approximately $250 million of the cost savings implemented in fiscal 2022. In addition, as discussed earlier, we expect to realize roughly half of the $300 million in annualized savings related to the optimization of our operating structure, including the elimination of approximately 1,800 corporate and upper field roles.We now expect capital expenditures in the range of $500 million to $525 million, down from our prior range of $500 million to $550 million, largely reflecting lower capital project investments as well as fewer store openings than previously planned. We now plan to open a net 25 to 30 Old Navy and Athleta stores in total, roughly 1/3 Old Navy stores and 2/3 Athleta stores. We continue to plan to close a net total of 50 to 55 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America, of which approximately more than half are Gap stores and the remaining, Banana Republic stores.We are entering fiscal 2023 better positioned as a result of the actions we are taking to change the trajectory of our business not only in the near term but even more importantly, setting the company up for the long term. We are confident in the actions we're taking and believe we are taking the right steps to position Gap Inc. back on its path towards sustainable profitable growth and delivering value for our shareholders over the long term.With that, we'll open up the line for questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Alex Straton from Morgan Stanley.Alexandra Ann StratonI have a couple that are probably best answered by Katrina, so both related to revenue. So on the quarter, is there any color you guys can give us on how it trended? Was it consistent? Did it strengthen or weaken as you got to the total results? And then on the 2Q guidance, it looks like you're assuming a worsening at the midpoint from the first quarter levels. Does that mean that you've seen a slowing in the business quarter-to-date? And is there any particular segment driving that?Katrina O'ConnellAlex, thanks for the question. So I think on your first question, I would say, we are obviously pleased that we were able to deliver on our expectations in the first quarter for revenue. And what we observed, I think, is largely in line with what we've heard others report, which is that February was quite strong and probably benefited from the fact that it was warm everywhere.And then in March, we definitely saw a similar weakening to what I think you've heard articulated largely as a result of the regional bank situation that was playing out and the impact that, that had to consumers as they tightened in March and then a little bit of a recovery in moderation in April, but we were navigating the lower tax return. So again, delivered the quarter but what we're observing is a much choppier environment for the way that the consumer is reacting to the news and how that's impacting the way they spend. As it relates to Q2 then, we have seen a little bit of that softness continue into May. But what I would say is that that's considered in the outlook we just provided. And the reason why we gave a range for Q2 is that we're trying to provide for whatever scenarios could potentially play out with some of the choppiness that we're seeing out there and if there are situations where the consumer contracts. So hopefully, that's helpful, but that's how we're thinking about it.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.Matthew Robert BossGreat. So Bob, you cited market share gains at the Old Navy brand. Maybe could you just expand on trends that you're seeing in that business and how you feel regarding the balance today in your assortments maybe relative to what you see driving the softer Athleta performance?Bobby L. MartinYes, I mean, we're certainly pleased to see the momentum carry in to drive the market share gains. And as you heard us point to a little bit in our last conversations, women's, in particular, were really strong. We cited some examples like pocket dresses and so forth, and that really has spilled over into several other categories. But as I think you were sort of referencing, it's really where our mind is as well. We still see the brand over-assorted from where we wanted to be. And again, that's just part of this transition that we're working through. But we've continued to see good gains in and around categories that we'll know or we believe that we'll continue to see greater strength in.The brand itself is in a period right now again of making a lot of those adjustments coming out of cleaning up its inventory, getting rid of the pack and hold and so forth. And I think the kind of performance that we'll see going forward will add a little bit more clarity around the categories in particular that we believe the brand will really thrive on long term. But right now, I'm happy with the progress and again, to see the kind of gains help us with some momentum.Look, on Athleta, it's just really clear that we walked away a little bit too far from our performance DNA. Definitely had some misses in and around product specifics, silhouettes, color and even just some of the styling, et cetera. And that really, again, gave us a big challenge relative to that customer, what she's coming in for. Although our bottoms continue to be really strong, we have to be able to capitalize on a lot more than that. And everything that, that brand stands for, for that customer, we're not backing down from at all. The Power of She, the emotion in the brand, performance, why we are moving aggressively to get in more aggressively in like running, yoga, some of those areas that we know have been real big misses for us.It's what that team right now is really focused on. And as we commented in our remarks, I'm really pleased right now how the current team is making the most, if you will, out of everything we have that the customer is really resonating with. And we look forward to seeing that brand find its stride again, no pun intended. But we know -- you know how important that brand is to the company, and we're optimistic that we're going to get back where we need to be.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach from Goldman Sachs.Brooke Siler RoachCan you talk to the composition of your inventory today and your current ability to chase into products that are resonating with the consumer, how much chaseability do you have? And do you think that could potentially improve your performance into the back half of the year? And then similarly, Katrina, can you provide some updated comments on your outlook for free cash flow?Bobby L. MartinYou go ahead and take the chase part, and I'll add to it.Katrina O'ConnellSure. I mean I think, Brooke, we're really pleased with the fact that we were able get our inventories down to where they are not only on a 1-year basis, but really back to 2019, being much more in line with what we consider to be healthy inventory levels. And I think you saw that show up in the gross margin performance for the quarter where we were able to still offer a lot of value to the consumer, but we didn't have all the markdown cleanup from last year that we had to deal with, and so we were able to really clean up that overall margin. So we feel good about that piece.As it relates to chase, I think we've talked about this. We are now back to being able to reinstate our responsive capabilities. And a lot of the organizational structural changes that we made in the business will also help us really have better line of sight to end-to-end inventory management and allows us to get back to really chasing into trends that are working. I think what's different is that Old Navy is back to pre-pandemic levels of chase, if not, slightly better. But now we have the capabilities across our brands, which is really nice to see. And so all of our brands should be able to be chasing inventory much closer to the consumer. I don't know if you wanted to add anything, Bobby?Bobby L. MartinNo, I think you covered it well. I think, Brooke, the one thing that I would just highlight again from my seat is, look, I mean, supply chain capabilities is something that we've really long had as a core strength, and I would say that a few things got away from us a bit. We're back really capitalizing now on our vendors who work with us very strong collaboratively, helping us with consumer insights, engaging, if you will, with innovation and all of that, that moves through the pipeline.So to your question about our expectations around the back half, I would say the answer is, yes, I mean, we believe that we're finding ourselves back where we've got great leverage points. We're seeing good success as we chase back in the product and again, really getting back to that discipline and rigor in a very effective way. So I'm actually proud of that progress, really quite proud.Katrina O'ConnellAnd then, Brooke, as you asked, obviously, our discipline around inventory and expenses combined with better operating performance is giving us more confidence in our free cash flow outlook. I think you heard on the call that free cash flow was down $102 million in the quarter, which is very in line with our seasonality and back to a much more normalized level. In fact, that's a lower level of outflow than we normally see in Q1 based on the fact that we have such tight inventory and expenses. And certainly, our aspiration is to get back to generating free cash flow in the company through better operating performance. So more to come as we see where the year comes out.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America Global Research.Lorraine Corrine Maikis HutchinsonI'm curious to hear more about the reduction in promotions at Old Navy. Can you talk about where margins are versus pre-COVID levels for that brand and also what the reaction has been to some of your recent price increases?Katrina O'ConnellYes, Lorraine, thanks for your question. Interestingly, when we look at the composition of the margin benefit that we got in the quarter across all of our banners, again, the reduction in inventory has really allowed us to clean up the markdown piece of the business, which doesn't add a lot of customer value, right? That's just inventory that last year wasn't responded too well by the consumer, and we had to sell through given excess inventory, the wrong inventory.So the margin benefits coming from cleaning up that markdown, what that's allowing us to do is still promote, which is a better way to be offering value to the consumer, which is still important at this time. And that's true at Old Navy. As it relates to price increases, I would say, overall, we are not seeing a lot of adverse reaction to price increases. The team was very surgical around taking up prices on categories or items that are known to be important in a consumer's wardrobe right now, like wovens or pants, or our outstanding fashion items that just are so wow that the customer has to have it. So I would say, as we look back, we feel very good about where the teams have priced up. And the promotions have remained rather competitive. As far as versus pre-pandemic, we're still better off than pre-pandemic.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jonna Kim from Cowen &amp; Company.Unidentified AnalystThis is [Neil Go] filling in for Jonna today. Just kind of touching on this from your point earlier. Can you just give some more color on how that promotional environment has been, perhaps different income cohorts and demographics since that was one of the brighter spots? And then what are you assuming from a timing perspective for the rest of the year as we eventually enter the back-to-school period?Katrina O'ConnellYes, [Neil], so I think what's interesting on our income cohort is that it continues to be similar to what we've seen in the back half into Q1, which is when you look at markets where we have a demographic of a low-income consumer, we are certainly seeing those consumers contract their spending and being much more price sensitive. In areas where we have the higher-income consumer, there's a lot less price sensitivity and they are still spending. So that dynamic has continued, and as of now, we'll see how that plays forward.But that's part of the reason why we have ranges of outcomes around our revenue performance, is because we don't know what will happen as we head into the back half of the year and decide whether we will need to compete more or less. I think, so far, what we've seen, and maybe you've heard this more in the industry, is that, as we just talked about, we've had to do less promotion to clear inventory because our inventories are so much more in line. And really, our promotions have been more focused on adding value to the consumer, which we hope will be more revenue driving actions and less about clearing inventory.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe from Jefferies.Corey TarloweFirst, I'm wondering, Katrina, if you could just assess for us the health of the Gap store fleet. I think over the last 2 years, you've closed something like 370 stores. The segment actually comped positively this past quarter, so it would be helpful to just get some color there.And then just on the Old Navy improvement that you're witnessing, recognizing that there's still more work to do. Maybe could you talk a little bit about what that work is and how far along or maybe what inning you think we're in, in terms of the Old Navy improvement?Katrina O'ConnellYes, Corey, as you say, the store fleet, we've worked aggressively on over the last 3 years during the COVID pandemic. And so as you say, overall, we have closed or will have closed by the end of this year about 350 Gap and Banana stores, so both of our specialty fleets, we've been working on. And do I think we're done? I don't know, but we are largely through the lion's share of the restructuring activity that had to be done. And I think as you say, that is showing up in the fact that the balance of the fleet that's remaining is relatively healthy. Now we need to continue to work on keeping that fleet healthy, but fundamentally right now, I think we feel pretty good with where we've positioned both our Gap and Banana Republic fleets.As it relates to Old Navy, I think you've heard us call out that we feel really good about the fact that we gained share in women's. I think we would say that we would like to keep seeing more momentum in men's and kids. And then within some of the categories, I think, active as an example, where we've gained a lot of share over a multiyear period, but we're seeing a little bit of reversion there, and there's probably some more work to do to get that assortment back to being current. But I don't know, Bobby, if you want to comment more on the Old Navy [piece].Bobby L. MartinNo. I mean, again, I think we're kind of indicating, again, we're seeing it travel along the journey here, again, getting the assortment, really rationalize and balance the right way. And look, you guys realize this as well as we do. This is across all brands. But I mean we design into the coolness, to the brand relevance, the creative, being right on fashion and getting inventory under control always.When we do that, we're always going to do a better job in driving brand relevance, maximizing marketing effectiveness. That certainly is true around the right promotional approach and balance for Old Navy and in turn, I think, continue to allow it to produce the kind of margin that we want to see and structure to run with and compete with and get back again to really the essence of that brand. That brand has always been known for fun, if you will, and the brand itself is -- or the team is working around what future of fun looks like around that brand and how it differentiates itself in the marketplace. Staying close to the customer, you guys touched on it, and I'll just acknowledge it back. That's a value proposition that we know we compete in very aggressively. I like the work that the team is doing, the rigor they're putting in around the right diagnostics at every level from -- whether it's online or in-store, this merchandising structure change, where we're moving ahead of commerce. So we're bringing together both the online and the in-store together around experience, and everything we're doing from a product and service is all a part of these improvements that, again, we're counting on and Old Navy, in particular, probably one of the bigger beneficiaries as we land all that work.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager from Baird.Mark R. AltschwagerI wanted to follow up on the promo topic as well and gross margin. It seems like the promo recapture was really the key driver to the upside to expectations in Q1, at least relative to our model and I think how many were looking at Q1 gross margin. Is that magnitude of recapture a good run rate to think about as we move through the next few quarters? And just given your comment about promo shifting more to being used to engage the customers versus clearing inventory, if we were to see some moderation in that Q1 result, I mean, would it be fair to think that we could maybe see some incremental top line benefit as we move through the year?Katrina O'ConnellYes, Mark, it's such a good question and one I'm really glad you asked. So the upside in Q1, as you say, we saw modest upside from freight, which we talked about, but really, the bigger upside, I think, came from less discounting. I would not use the 380 basis points of benefit from discounting as a run rate. We just said that, in Q2, about 200 -- at least 200 basis points of inflationary pressure will get offset in discount, so that already nods to a moderation.And then for the full year, we said at least 100 basis points in that discount. And you could ask why wouldn't we see more. I think right now what we're saying is that's the way we'd say maybe a floor of what we think that's worth. We'll see how hard we have to play in Q2 and beyond depending on where the consumer goes and whether that shows up in revenue or whether that shows up just in us having to play harder to be able to compete as we move through the year.So I'm glad you asked the question. Those do moderate as we get through the year. And again, depending on where the customer lands, we'll see whether there's upside there or not.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Paul Kearney from Barclays.Paul David KearneyCan you talk more about some of the efforts to reduce costs and simplify? How will the changes you've made improve responsiveness throughout the organization? And are there additional levers to drive sustainable savings as you rebase this year?Bobby L. MartinPaul, it's Bobby. I'll start and see if Katrina wants to add on to it. But look, I think it almost goes without saying, getting rid of layers from 12 to 8, the effect on span of control, it's really clear that where we found ourselves was really slowing down and impacting our ability to be quick on decision-making as well as certainly identifying where we've had productivity misses and the like. So that work, I don't think should be understated. It's difficult work that's gone on. But we found ourselves with an SG&amp;A, obviously, that was untenable, not one that we would look to continue to try and compete with. So pulling out the cost is relevant and it's meaningful, but again, I'd just go back and point to the big payback and unlock here is, again, as I made in my -- I mentioned in my comments, the big payback is when we're going to start showing up more informed, more in tune with the customer being driven by consumer insights, more responsive and the like.So we're not doing anything here other than I hope what you caught is we're in pursuit of a mindset change and a cultural shift that keeps us in this mode all the time of continuous improvement and looking at how we continue to not just cut the cost but again, get ourselves where we're far more responsible -- or responsive, agile and again, a lot more competitive.Just one more time, I'd say difficult work in the short time that I have been here, although didn't feel all that short. I'm really pleased with, again, the way the team has embraced this change. Any of us that have watched this level of change happen, we know it takes a lot. And right now, I think our quarter results indicate some good -- show some good indication of where we have reason to be pleased with part of it, but we have a lot farther to go and a lot more work to do.Katrina O'ConnellAnd Paul, I think to add on what I would say is regarding further savings, right now, we're really pleased with the cost savings that are coming from these organizational changes as well as some early savings we got last year in marketing through some contract negotiations and a little bit of tech. But marketing and technology, I think, are the 2 areas that we've identified we have further opportunity in. And now that we have our organizational structures in place and those teams get settled, we'll begin the work to really understand what the next opportunity will look like. So more to come when we get through the organizational change and are able to sort of move our focus to those next items of opportunity.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Janet Kloppenburg from JJK Research.Janet Joseph KloppenburgCongratulations on the improvement. Nice to see. Katrina, on the promotion and less recapture, that assumption for the second quarter, is that a trend that you're seeing right now? And do you feel, even with your inventories down as much as they are, that you've had to step up promotions?And I also wondered, in your guidance for the second quarter and for the year, what the assumption is on kids and men's. Do you expect those categories to improve? Or do you expect that pressure to be maintained as we move through the year?And lastly, I wondered if there was any news on denim and how that might be affecting your back-to-school outlook. And one last question, sorry, is just on where we should expect inventories to trend going forward. Sorry.Katrina O'ConnellNo worries. So on the gross margin and promotional trend, I mean, I'm not really going to comment. It's very early in the quarter, so we'll see. We've given you a sense for the year -- I mean, for the quarter and the year where we think those things will land. And so we'll see how it goes. Memorial Day is coming up. That's usually a big kickoff to summer, and so we'll see how that all goes.On the kids and men's thing, kids, in general, the marketplace has been down. So while our kids business has been modestly under pressure, we've been gaining share at Old Navy. And so we'll see how that goes. But there's sort of a range of possible outcomes for both kids and men's as we look to the second quarter and the second half, all of which are contemplated in the guidance we gave.And then on the denim front, we've been gaining share in denim all year, and we gained share again in Q1, so we're relatively pleased with what the teams have been doing around denim. And I guess we'll see how that plays out in back to school, but at least we've got some good momentum heading into back to school in that category. There was a fourth one I can't remember. What was it?Janet Joseph KloppenburgInventory, Katrina, inventory.Katrina O'ConnellInventories. Yes, so we said in my -- or I said in my speech that we do expect for inventories to be down meaningfully more than the sales guide. So we'll see, but we did end up down 27%, and that will be our goal, is to keep those inventories well under control.Operator(Operator Instructions) Your last question will come from Marni Shapiro from The Retail Tracker.Marni ShapiroCongratulations on some really nice improvements in the stores. I just wanted to focus a little bit on Athleta again because I know this is a growth vehicle for you and important as you're searching for leadership there. Could you give us an estimated time line of when you think the changes with color, print and the better balance start to really show up? Will it be there for back to school and the fall season and for winter gifting?And then if we could also just think forward, do you need new leadership in place to start innovating? Because even this is a part of the market that's heavy on innovation, the performance part of the market, and while I like a lot of the styles you have, some of them have become a little stale, while other brands are advancing in this moment. So I'm just curious if you could talk about those 2 parts of the business.Bobby L. MartinDo you want me to start?Katrina O'ConnellSure.Bobby L. MartinFirst of all, thanks for being so kind, Marni. I would say that -- to answer to your question kind of from the bottom back. Do we need to have new leadership to really start seeing the innovation? I would not take anything away from current team. Again, our focus has really, I think, enabled a lot of moves and changes there. We've already seen wonderful contributions from Julia Leach who we added as kind of fresh perspective on the creative side.You do understand obviously quite well because of the question that fabrications and other things really are a little bit longer pipe for this brand. That said, the brand is taking every opportunity we can, where if it was an opportunity for raw material to be adjusted a bit to land something for fall, perhaps holiday, there are opportunities being engineered into that. But to go much farther than that, I think that would be too aggressive.At the same time, [this seems] amazing me right now, everything that they're doing to come up to maximize opportunity. What's most important obviously here is, again, we know what this brand stands for. We know what she looks for every time she comes in. You just highlighted it again. And it'll take us a while to get back where we need to be, but hopefully, we will exceed your expectations and mine.Marni ShapiroI hope so. Can I just ask one follow-up? You've been promotional, obviously, to clear out the inventory, and it's going to take some time to fix this. Even within the store today, are there things that she's buying that don't need a promotion? And is there a risk that she gets used to 20% off, 30% off, 40% off there? So how careful do you have to be over the next couple of months in dealing with this?Bobby L. MartinGo ahead, Katrina.Katrina O'ConnellYes, Marni, I mean I think that's a great question. We certainly see that there are core performance bottoms and there are fashion styles that don't need a promotion, and the team is being very cognizant on trying not to train her for promotion by utilizing markdowns better to be more targeted. And there -- but there is a reality of sort of where we are today and where we need to go. The ultimate goal will be to get that brand back to not relying on promotions to be able to drive the business but drive the business through its fashion authority and its innovation and its positioning. And that is what the team is working towards long term. So it's a great question and one that the team is definitely focused on.OperatorThat does conclude our conference call. You may now disconnect.]"

This compares to loss of $0.44 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 105.88%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this clothing chain would post a loss of $0.59 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.75, delivering a surprise of -27.12%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Gap , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, posted revenues of $3.28 billion for the quarter ended April 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.37%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.48 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Gap shares have lost about 32.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.2%.What's Next for Gap?While Gap has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Gap: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.19 on $3.65 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.58 on $14.99 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Seana, what are we watching right now?SEANA SMITH: Akiko, we have a couple of other names for you, a mix of gainers and losers here in after-hours trading. Let's kick it off with Gap because we're looking at a gain of just about 16%, following their most recent earnings report here. Upbeat results from the company-- better than expected earnings, margin improvement. Cost-cutting efforts really starting to pay off. Also inventory improvement, certainly a theme that we have heard about this earnings season. Inventory falling 27% on a year over year basis.Now, all of this overshadowing the losses that we did see in comp sales across all of the brands here, that fell just about 3%, mostly driven by the large drops that we saw in Banana Republic and Athleta. The company also saying that it's still searching for a permanent CEO. We know that has been an issue for shareholders for analysts lately.Year to date, we're looking at losses of just about 34%. Moving on to RH, another retail play here. That stock off about 3% in extended trading. They cut their full-year margin forecast, saying that a likely have to offer more markdowns as a result of the need to clear some of that inventory that it cannot clear.That also week ago, we heard from the 13 up filing from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's company there, that they did sell their stake in RH. So another problem here for the company here going forward. Year to date, we're looking at losses of just about 5%.Ulta Beauty, the cosmetic play here, down just about 9% in extended trading. They did temper their margin expectations. That is weighing on the stock in extended trading. Now, in this release, the company did note some of the challenges that they face due to thefts, something that we have also heard from other retailers this earnings season. The company saying that organized retail crime increasingly a challenge here. Year to date, shares are essentially flat.And rounding out with Workday. That's a big gainer after hours, up just about 8%, a beat on both the top and bottom line. Subscription revenue up 20% on a year over year basis. The company also announcing a new CFO Zane Rowe, formerly the CFO at VMware. This company also was one of these names to mention AI in this earnings release, writing, quote, ""We remain committed to innovation and infusing AI across our entire product portfolio."" Year to date, we're looking at gains of just about 17%.AKIKO FUJITA: Got to sprinkle in AI in those calls. Thanks so much for that, Seana.]"

Inventory volumes declined 27% from a year earlier, according to Chief Financial Officer Katrina OâConnell.Gap, like many retailers, sped up its ordering as consumer demand surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, only to be left with piles of unsold inventory as spending normalized.""It was an okay quarter that was better than expected or feared,"" said CFRA Research analyst Zachary Warring.Since September, the retailer has eliminated about 2,300 corporate positions in two rounds of layoffs, joining a set of big U.S. companies that are downsizing in earnest as high inflation eats into consumer wallets.Interim CEO Bob Martin in a post earnings call said job cuts should contribute to nearly $550 million in estimated annualized savings on a cumulative basis.Executives pointed to lower spending on salaries and other operating costs in a bid to improve margins, along with efforts to reduce inventories.The company will have closed about 350 underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores by the end of the year and plans to open fewer stores this year than projected, OâConnell said.Still, sales for all Gap's four brands declined in the quarter as the retailer struggled to update inventory and match consumer trends.""I feel like they've picked a lot of the low-hanging fruit in terms of closing stores and cutting costs,"" said Mari Shor, a senior equity analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.Story continues""Now you really need Athleta and Old Navy, which are the growth drivers, to return to growth, but I have pretty little confidence in that happening in the near term.""Like major retailers, including Target and Best Buy, Gap is also witnessing weak demand as lower- and mid-income consumers curb spending on non-essential items such as apparel.""Sales and sales guidance is worse than peers, but it looks like they are focused on profitability,"" Warring said.Gap reported first-quarter adjusted profit of 1 cent, compared with estimates for a loss of 16 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data.The company's net sales fell 6% to $3.28 billion. Analysts were expecting $3.29 billion.Gap maintained its annual sales forecast and expects second-quarter sales to fall in the mid- to high-single digit range. Analysts on average expect second-quarter sales to decline 4.95%.(Reporting by Kate Masters in New York and Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath, Marguerita Choy and David Gregorio)]"

Investors have their eye on big retail earnings. The drama in D.C. over the debt ceiling. And the exuberance we have seen today around AI. Our next guest has some advice about the best ways to play in the market amid all of the volatility. Here with some stocks to add to your portfolio and some to avoid, let's bring in David Trainer. New Constructs, CEO.David good to talk to you today. Let's start with the one that really stood out to me, which is Ford, this is a stock you really like, along with GM. A legacy automaker who has really pivoted to EVs. I wonder how you're looking at that stock. Because, yes, they've made big bets there, and yet they are still, as recent results showed, a long way from profitability, at least on the EV side.DAVID TRAINER: Yeah. And honestly, so is Tesla. I mean, Tesla brags about cash flow, but their free cash flow burn has been huge, whereas GM have profitable legacy businesses that generate a ton of positive free cash flow. So they can actually subsidize the losses in EV in the way that Tesla cannot. Tesla sold enormous amount of stock, we all know about that, and they don't make real cash on the business.So we think the EVs are effectively inherently better positioned to enter a new market than even the incumbents. Even the first-mover advantage for Tesla is not over comfortable. I think it's already been overcome.- So David, when it comes to Ford's, I guess, potential to really recapture some of that market share that it has not been able to get here from Tesla. Yet what does that look like, and do you think they're going to be able to get the two million EV goal that Jim Farley has laid out a number of times?DAVID TRAINER: I think so. I mean, look, they've got a track record of actually mass-producing vehicles at scale and with quality. Tesla doesn't have that. They've done it before. I think they will. And we've seen Tesla's market share already see pretty drastic declines in Europe or more advanced EV markets. We think the same thing will happen here.Story continuesThe main difference, really-- one of the main differences between Ford and GM, though, in terms of risk-reward, which we think is most important. At the end of the day, unless you've got a crystal ball and can predict the future, you need to do the best you can with respect to risk-reward. The risk in GM and Ford is extremely low compared to Tesla.The stock prices of both GM and Ford imply large permanent profit declines. No profit growth, permanent profit decline. Tesla, on the other hand, its stock price implies that it's going to be nearly as profitable as Apple. So there's a ridiculous amount of expectations for future profitability in Tesla, and there's expectations for the opposite of in GM and Ford, so you just got a much better situation in terms of risk-reward.- Another stock you really like is CSCO. You could argue that's one of legacy tech names. And what do you like there, and how much upside do you see?DAVID TRAINER: Yeah, it's cheap also. And we're seeing not maybe as much upside in a Ford or GM, but there's a good 20% to 30% upside, which we think is very strong in a very kind of heady frothy market.And look, it's like the picks and shovels of the growth in the data business and the growth in the internet, right. I mean, the plumbing and the infrastructure that CSCO provides is going to see plenty of tailwinds for its demand as demand for data we all know is only getting bigger and faster, and we don't expect that to stop. And Cisco's priced at a discount to a lot of these other heavy tech names like NVIDIA, for example, which is priced for perfection. We think you get much better risk-reward in a stock like CSCO.- David, what does this stock like CSCO, though? Because we have heard some cautious comments from Chuck Robbins in the last earnings call, saying that he is seeing some caution when it comes to their clients. If we were to see a recession, what does that mean for a name like CSCO?DAVID TRAINER: I mean, it's a lot less resilient than more high-end ticket items like a Tesla or even in more cyclical area like an Nvidia. I mean, people are-- everybody's using more data. And think about again, CSCO more like picks and shovels for that area. And so we think they'll be better off in a recessionary environment.But the main thing is the stock price is so much cheaper, the valuation is so much less. You've got a lot less downside to deal with if the economy goes into the gutter.- David, one of the names that you're watching is CAVA. They recently just filed to go public. What do you think that setup looks like? Are you potentially interested in a name like that, given some of the underperformance that we've seen from the other names in that space recently?DAVID TRAINER: We think CAVA is the next WeWork. We don't think this IPO should actually ever happen. This is a ruse to trick unsuspecting retail investors into buying. What is a terrible business? It's burning cash flow. It's cash flow is only going to get worse.And we think the only reason this company is deciding to IPO in this environment because if they can't get an IPO done now, they never will because the cash flow burn is going to get even worse. We just published the report on our own website. We're one of the few firms is going to provide you any IPO research. We're one of the few firms that's going to provide you honest research, and CAVA is one to avoid for the ages.- David Trainer always with the brutal assessment there. Good to talk to you today. I appreciate the time.DAVID TRAINER: Thank you.]"
