1,d2237228-f21a-3343-bdb5-f781dbf7375e,SCHW,2022-11-21,Is Schwab Fundamental International Small Company Index ETF (FNDC) a Strong ETF Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-fundamental-international-small-company-112011884.html,1669029611,STORY,['SCHW'],"[The Schwab Fundamental International Small Company Index ETF (FNDC) was launched on 08/13/2013, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Broad Developed World ETFs category of the market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexThe fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $2.60 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs in the Broad Developed World ETFs. This particular fund, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI Developed ex-U.S. Small Co. Index (Net).The Russell RAFI Developed ex US Small Company Index (Net) measures the performance of the small company size segment by fundamental overall company scores, which are created using as the universe the developed ex U.S. companies in the FTSE Global Total Cap Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Story continuesWith on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.39%.FNDC's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 2.87%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.When you look at individual holdings, Vermilion Energy Inc (VET) accounts for about 0.40% of the fund's total assets, followed by Arc Resources Ltd (ARX) and Capitaland Investment Ltd (9CI).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 2.04% of FNDC's total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, FNDC has lost about -17.54%, and is down about -18.39% in the last one year (as of 11/21/2022). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $26.94 and $38.45.The ETF has a beta of 0.91 and standard deviation of 22.90% for the trailing three-year period, making it a low risk choice in the space. With about 1826 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental International Small Company Index ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Developed World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) tracks FTSE Global All Cap ex US Index and the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA) tracks FTSE Developed All Cap ex US Index. Vanguard Total International Stock ETF has $48.62 billion in assets, Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF has $98.66 billion. VXUS has an expense ratio of 0.07% and VEA charges 0.05%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Broad Developed World ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2,98fb07f1-5662-3840-be92-a97684ac84fa,TXN,2022-11-21,Should You Be Adding Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) To Your Watchlist Today?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adding-texas-instruments-nasdaq-txn-120202633.html,1669032122,STORY,['TXN'],"[It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments How Fast Is Texas Instruments Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Impressively, Texas Instruments has grown EPS by 21% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The music to the ears of Texas Instruments shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 47% to 53% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Texas Instruments' future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Texas Instruments Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Texas Instruments, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$173m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.1% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Should You Add Texas Instruments To Your Watchlist?For growth investors, Texas Instruments' raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Texas Instruments' continuing strength. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. Still, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Texas Instruments (including 2 which can't be ignored).Although Texas Instruments certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Microchip Companies in the World.The microchip, or semiconductor industry consists of companies engaged in the production of semiconductors and related devices which can include integrated circuits and transistors. It is one of the more recent industries out there, having come into existence in 1960. By 2018, the industry was making close to half a trillion dollars in annual revenue, recording total sales of $556 billion in 2021. 2021 saw more than 1.1 trillion semiconductor chips being shipped, setting a new record for the total number of semiconductor chips being issued in a single year. It is also one of the most important industries as it provides products for the tech and electronics industry. The tech industry reached sales of over $5 trillion in 2018, while e-commerce exceeded $29 trillion in sales in 2017. In 2027, the semiconductor industry is expected to be worth more than $726 billion.The semiconductor industry is mainly used for computers and related equipment, which makes up 32.3% of the total market share of microprocessors. This is followed by consumer electronics which makes up nearly a fifth of the total market share. Telecommunications equipment, industrial electronics, defense and aerospace industry, and the transportation industry account for the remaining major market share of the microdevices industry.15 biggest microchip companies in the worldIaroslav Neliubov/Shutterstock.comChina is the one of the biggest producers and markets of semiconductors and includes a variety of companies such as integrated device manufacturers to fabless semiconductor companies to pure-play foundries. While China has many major companies in each type of industry, all of its companies fail to make the list of the biggest microdevice companies in the world. The Chinese semiconductor industry is about to experience further setbacks as in October 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced that there would be changes to export control policies towards China, with the major focus of this revision impacting the semiconductor industry and the artificial intelligence industry. The impact of this on the Chinese industry, while uncertain, will be significant, especially for the companies working on technology nodes that are less than a decade long.Story continuesMost of the biggest microchip companies in the world are in the United States, with 10 of the biggest 15 being located in the country, with the others being in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. In 2022, the semiconductor industry will be worth $600 billion though most of this will be concentrated among a few companies in just a handful of countries. The semiconductor industry has been affected by major supply chain shortages over the past two years, and even though semiconductor chips can often cost less than a dollar, a delay in their delivery can result in the delay of the assembly of a device worth tens of thousands of dollars. In fact, assessments are that the supply delays of microchips resulted in the loss of more than $500 billion either directly or indirectly, with lost auto sales being worth $210 billion in 2021 alone. While these shortages are expected to continue in the first half of 2023, the industry is still expected to grow by 10% while companies within the industry will continue to innovate and digitize.

Some consumers plan on not only buying less, but also trading down to cheaper price points and quality levels.Another survey out of Citi found that all income brackets indicated they planned to spend less, with the greatest percent of respondents indicating the decision was due to having less money to spend and because of high fuel and food prices.Makes sense based on what retail execs are telling me.“I think we're going to be operating in a very uncertain environment,"" Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell told me. ""A consumer that's clearly facing the challenges of managing a budget, and they're going to be looking for promotions. So we'll be preparing for that.""Walmart's CFO John David Rainey told me consumers are ""looking for value,"" as if to hint the shopper will leave an item on the shelf if the value equation isn't right.Story continuesA Santa Claus statue is seen near a sale sign during Black Friday sales at the Eagle Rock Plaza in the Eagle Rock area of Los Angeles November 26, 2010.

The benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index is down 17% year to date, while the tech-centric Nasdaq has plunged nearly 30% in the same period.If you don’t want to get caught up in the market’s wild swings, you might want to check out a few low-beta stocks (also known as low-volatility stocks).Beta is a measure of a stock’s volatility in comparison to the market as a whole. If a stock has a beta of greater than one, it’s more volatile than the broad market. Stocks with beta values of less than one are less sensitive to the market’s movements.Here’s a look at three low-beta stocks that could be worth considering.Don't missYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Mitt Romney says a billionaire tax will trigger demand for these two assets — get in now before the super-rich swarmWalmart (WMT)At a time when many brick-and-mortar retailers remain in the doldrums, powerhouse Walmart stands out.The company runs a massive retail business with approximately 10,500 stores under 46 banners in 24 countries. Thanks to its “Everyday Low Prices,” Walmart attracts around 230 million customers to its stores and websites every week.Walmart could be an opportunity for those looking for low volatility: the stock’s five-year beta is just 0.53 and is actually up 5.5% over the past year.And because of the company’s massive economies of scale, the business has remained resilient throughout several economic cycles.Consider this: Walmart paid its first-ever dividend in 1974. Since then, it has increased its payout every single year.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)With deeply entrenched positions in consumer health, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices markets, healthcare giant Johnson &amp; Johnson has delivered consistent returns to investors.Story continuesMany of the company’s consumer health brands — such as Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine — are household names. In total, JNJ has 29 products each capable of generating over $1 billion in annual sales.Over the past 20 years, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s adjusted earnings have increased at an average annual rate of 8%.Read more: Buy when there's blood in the streets: Here are the best investing apps to pounce on 'once-in-a-generation' opportunities (even if you're a beginner)JNJ announced its 60th consecutive annual dividend increase in April and now offers an annual dividend yield of 2.6%.The stock has a five-year beta of 0.57 and is up 8% over the past year.Coca-Cola (KO)Coca-Cola is a classic example of a recession-resistant business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable for most people.The company’s entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands — including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater — give it plenty of pricing power.Add solid geographic diversification — its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe — and it’s clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago.According to the latest earnings report, Coca-Cola’s net revenue grew 10% year over year, while its adjusted earnings per share improved by 7%.The stock has a five-year beta of 0.58 and has climbed by 11% in 2022.Still can't stand stocks?Of course, you don't have to limit yourself to stocks.Amid hot inflation and the uncertain economy, savvy investors have been diversifying their investments outside of the stock market.Prime commercial real estate, for example, has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over a 25-year period. With the help of new platforms, these kinds of opportunities are now available to retail investors. Not just the ultra rich.With a single investment, investors can own institutional-quality properties leased by brands like CVS, Kroger and Walmart — and collect stable grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, long term Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) shareholders have enjoyed a 55% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 45% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 7.2% , including dividends .Since it's been a strong week for Walmart shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. View our latest analysis for Walmart There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Walmart's earnings per share are down 2.7% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.So it's hard to argue that the earnings per share are the best metric to judge the company, as it may not be optimized for profits at this point. Therefore, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movements.The modest 1.5% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. In contrast revenue growth of 3.7% per year is probably viewed as evidence that Walmart is growing, a real positive. It's quite possible that management are prioritizing revenue growth over EPS growth at the moment.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWalmart is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Walmart will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Walmart, it has a TSR of 71% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Walmart has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 7.2% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 11% a year, is even better. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

(NYSE:MMC) insider upped their holding by 9.8% earlier this year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marsh-mclennan-companies-inc-nyse-120220685.html,1669032140,STORY,['MMC'],"[From what we can see, insiders were net buyers in Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc.'s (NYSE:MMC ) during the past 12 months. That is, insiders acquired the stock in greater numbers than they sold it.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider Marc Oken made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$837k worth of shares at a price of US$167 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$168. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. The good news for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies share holders is that an insider was buying at near the current price. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Marc Oken.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of Marsh &amp; McLennan CompaniesI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders own about US$202m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies shares in the last quarter. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. With high insider ownership and encouraging transactions, it seems like Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies insiders think the business has merit. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies.But note: Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Glencore said it had not been involved in any investigations or proceedings related to the matter. Ernst and Young and Macquarie Bank declined to comment.SGS, ALS and TerraCom did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The allegations were similar to those first reported by the Australian Financial Review in 2020.Then allegations in an unfair dismissal case claimed Australian miner TerraCom Ltd had worked with ALS’s Brisbane-based testing laboratory to falsely upgrade the quality of its coal in export documentation. TerraCom denied the allegations, while ALS launched an independent investigation into the claims.Story continuesALS said in 2020 the probe found that about half the certificates it provided for export coal samples over the past decade had been manually altered. It did not give a reason for the alterations but said the probe found no evidence of bribery.Corporate watchdog Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), which investigated the allegations, said in an October letter to ALS that it had reviewed all the evidence and decided against taking any action against the company.“However, having regard to ASIC’s jurisdiction, we are currently investigating possible misleading market disclosures by coal miner TerraCom and whistleblower-related matters. The investigation is well advance,"" an ASIC spokesperson told Reuters, referring to the allegations first made in 2020.

We've done it this way in the past and that's the mechanism we're using going forward.""The deal was signed on an ex-ship basis, meaning QatarEnergy will provide the shipping and delivery of the LNG.Kaabi added negotiations for an equity stake in the Gulf country's expansion project were ongoing with several entities.The supply contract is a key component for an integrated partnership in the NFE, Sinopec said in a statement, indicating it could be involved in stake negotiations.QatarEnergy has maintained a 75% stake overall in the expansion and could give up to a 5% stake from its holding to some buyers, Kaabi said.""Important buyers that want to commit for the long term on a substantial volume want to see part of the benefits of the upstream business... so I think it's an important win if you will and it makes the partnership even more solid.""Sources told Reuters in June that China's national oil majors were in advanced talks with Qatar to invest in NFE.

Second, we believe that in order to catalyze meaningful progress in climate solutions, a significant portion of financial incentives should be linked to such climate goals. Third, the measurement of those goals should be transparent to limited partners.

24,25a4cae5-b46e-3243-ba7e-95fbc2696377,OMC,2022-11-21,7 Dividend Stocks With Low Payout Ratios and High Yields,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-stocks-low-payout-201945191.html,1668716385,STORY,"['TSN', 'HPQ', 'TGT', 'IBM', 'OMC', 'CAG', 'MTB-PH']","[With the market offering little clues as to its ultimate trajectory, investors may want to consider dividend stocks with low payout ratios. Passive income always represents an attractive attribute but that’s only half of the story. The other half centers on sustainability of said income, which is where the payout ratio comes into play.Essentially, this metric represents the proportion of earnings from which a company pays its shareholders in the form of dividends. While no absolute rules exist, generally speaking, the lower the range of the payout ratio, the higher probability that the underlying dividends are sustainable. Therefore, dividend stocks with low payout ratios – but still commanding relatively high yields – bring much to the table.Of course, you’re going to have to work with me on this list. Typically, the higher the reward, the greater the risk. Nevertheless, I’ve put together an eclectic mix of dividend stocks with low payout ratios that should help investors ride out the current storm.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTGTTarget$160.31MTBM&amp;T Bank$167.26TSNTyson Foods$65.03HPQHP Inc.$29.26CAGConagra$34.88OMCOmnicom$76.15IBMIBM.$145.77Target (TGT)Source: ShutterstockGoing speculative as the lead-off name for this list of dividend stocks with low payout ratios, Target (NYSE:TGT) immediately draws concerns. Fundamentally, the current pensive environment resulted in consumer sentiment slipping near historic lows. What’s more, Target recently warned of a weak holiday sales cycle, sending shares down 13% for the Nov. 16 session.If that wasn’t bad enough, management also mentioned that organized retail crime sparked $400 million in extra profit loss. Obviously, the big-box retailer isn’t having a great time. Nevertheless, adventurous investors may want to target TGT as one of the dividend stocks with low payout ratios to buy.For one thing, in the trailing month, the stock actually gained slightly over 4%. Therefore, it’s possible that the volatility represented a one-and-done move. More to the point, Target offers a forward yield of 2.78%, ranking above the consumer staples average yield of 1.89%. In addition, its payout ratio of 36.28% should be sustainable, irrespective of recent woes.Story continuesM&amp;T Bank (MTB)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Headquartered in Buffalo, New York, M&amp;T Bank (NYSE:MTB) is a regional financial institution. The firm features 780 branches in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Fundamentally, regional banks may be somewhat insulated than their larger multinational peers as they focus on local communities. That’s especially true with people concerned about a global slowdown.MTB also attracts attention because it’s one of the dividend stocks with low payout ratios. Per Dividend.com, M&amp;T Bank features a forward yield of 2.85%. To be completely transparent, this figure rates lower than the sector average yield of 3.18%. But hear me out. The payout ratio sits at 24.75%, reflecting a sustainable and dependable flow of passive income.As well, the company carries a cash-to-debt ratio of 6.32 times, ranking higher than 77.5% of the competition. Also, its equity-to-asset ratio stands at 0.13 times, beating out the industry median of 0.09 times.Tyson Foods (TSN)A package of Tyson Foods (TSN) chicken breasts.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comAlthough a relevant company because of its indelible products, Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) embodies another enterprise loaded with distractions. This time, it’s of management’s doing, with the company’s CFO arrested for a trespassing and intoxication incident. Still, if you can get over this blight, an argument exists for TSN as one of the dividend stocks with low payout ratios to considerPer Dividend.com, Tyson offers a forward yield of 2.98%. Conspicuously, this ranks higher than the sector average of 1.89%. In addition, the payout ratio sits at a pedestrian 26.87%. As well, Tyson enjoys 10 years of consecutive dividend increases. While it’s not a Target – which has 50 years – the food processor is on a roll. Certainly, management will not want to give it up, especially since it needs to shape up.Financially, investors can take confidence that Tyson enjoys solid profit margins. As well, its return on equity (ROE) stands at 22.3%, reflecting a high-quality business. Even with all these positive attributes, TSN trades for only 8.4-times forward earnings, which is blisteringly cheap.HP (HPQ)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comGiven the aforementioned troubles in the consumer economy, it’s not particularly surprising that HP (NYSE:HPQ) struggled this year. Since the January opener, shares gave up 23% of equity value. With the underlying business focusing on personal computers, printers, and 3D printing solutions, HP needs sentiment to pick up. Interestingly, though, shares gained 14% in the trailing month.If you happen to own the conviction that most of the bad news already baked itself into HPQ, then you may want to consider its proposition as one of the dividend stocks with low payout ratios. Per Dividend.com, the company carries a forward yield of 3.41%. That’s much higher than the technology sector average of 1.37%. Additionally, the payout ratio sits at 27.57%, a sustainable level.As well, investors should note that the company owns 12 years of consecutive dividend increases. Again, it’s not a track record that management will give up on easily. Finally, HPQ might be grossly undervalued. Currently, shares trade at 5.1-times trailing-12-month earnings, well below the industry median of 17.5 times.Conagra Brands (CAG)Conagra logo on a sign outside of a corporate campusSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAn American consumer packaged goods holding company, Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) represents one of the most pertinent dividend stocks with low payout ratios to consider. According to its public profile, Conagra makes and sells products under various brand names that are available in supermarkets, restaurants, and food service establishments.One of the more attractive features of CAG centers on its higher-ranking passive income profile. Per Dividend.com, Conagra carries a forward yield of 3.77%. This figure flies above the consumer staples average of only 1.89%. To be fair, the payout ratio is edging a bit on the higher side of things at 54%. However, with the company’s relatively predictable demand structure, this payout shouldn’t be a problem.Now, in full transparency, Conagra’s financials could use some improvement. However, it’s getting the job done. For instance, the company’s operating margin stands at 8.2%, ranking above 66% of the competition.Omnicom (OMC)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAn American global media, marketing, and corporate communications holding firm, Omnicom (NYSE:OMC) presents a higher-risk profile among dividend stocks with low payout ratios. Per its public profile, Omnicom provides services in four fields: advertising, customer relationship management, public relations, and specialty services. Again, with global slowdown fears materializing, OMC trades in an awkward juncture.Nevertheless, the stock performed remarkably well given the circumstances. Since the beginning of the year, OMC gained 3%. Aside from the capital gains potential, arguably most investors will tune into the passive income narrative. Here, the company features a forward yield of 3.68%, beating out the communications sector average of 2.62%. The payout ratio is reasonably low based on the high yield of 42.72%.That’s not all. Fundamentally, Omnicom enjoys strong profitability metrics. In particular, its operating margin of 14.45% ranks higher than over 80% of the industry. As a parting bonus, OMC trades at 12.2 times TTM earnings, which sits on the discounted side of the spectrum.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVPerhaps not the most exciting name among dividend stocks with low payout ratios, you’re going to have to extend me some rope with IBM (NYSE:IBM). Against absolute standards, it’s certainly not the lowest payout ratio you can find. However, Big Blue brings a combination of generous passive income and an underappreciated business.For instance, while most tech names incurred heavy losses in the market this year, IBM stock gained over 6%. To be sure, that beats out all three of the major equity indices. In addition, the legacy stalwart pivoted to many relevant businesses, including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and even the blockchain. Thus, you ignore IBM to your disadvantage.Per Dividend.com, Big Blue offers a healthy forward yield of 4.57%. Again, this ranks much higher than the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Now, where it gets a bit tricky is the payout ratio, which stands at nearly 69%. However, with 28 years of consecutive dividend increases, I believe IBM earns a second look.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

If you want to skip our introduction to the industry, then take a look at 5 Biggest Medical Device Companies in the World.The medical device market comprises companies that manufacture equipment used in diagnosing, treating and surveillance medical disorders. The market for medical devices is changing dramatically. The complicated patient demands and the COVID-19 pandemic encouraged businesses to innovate and produce new creative solutions, and the medical devices industry continued to see exceptional growth in 2020. The global market for medical equipment was worth roughly $456.8 billion in 2020, with a CAGR (Compound annual growth rate) of 3.5% from 2015. This market is expanding due to the rise in demand for high-tech medical items. There was a fall in the number of diagnoses for various diseases including cancer and TB among others as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic. However, as the pandemic wanes off, the medical device industry is continuing to get back on its growth trajectory.The frequency of chronic diseases will significantly affect the global medical device market beyond 2022. This encourages the employment of ever-improving technology tools for early disease detection and the creation of intelligent equipment like 3D printing, robots, and the internet of things. As a result, the market for medical device technology will expand at a CAGR of 4.9% from 2022 to 2027. Growth is predicted from $465.5 billion in 2022 to $591.3 billion in 2027.Some of the major players in the medical device industry are Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), and Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT).smart.art/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe list includes firms that manufacture medical equipment to treat illnesses.

(NYSE:GMED) in its Q4 2020 investor letter:“Healthcare continued its streak of underperformance in the fourth quarter. The biotech industry component of the Russell 2000 was up 34% for the quarter and 53% for the year. While we have become more open to investing in this space where appropriate, we prefer molecular diagnostics given less regulatory risk and better revenue diversification. With the new administration comes a shift in healthcare philosophy. We believe that further access to care and coverage expansion will benefit some parts of the sector.

(NYSE:PEN) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“Our aversion toward early-stage biotech proved productive as did our approach of emphasizing the enablers and selected, profitable medical technology companies. Strong contributors during the fourth quarter included Penumbra, a developer of stents and related products to treat aneurysms that saw it shares recover from a product recall earlier in the year.”13. ShockWave Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWAV)Market Cap as of November 18: $8.96 B Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34ShockWave Medical, Inc.

(NASDAQ:SWAV) is an early stage medical device company developing and commercializing products to treat calcified cardiovascular disease. The company’s recent quarter of +116% YoY revenue growth was well ahead of expectations. The beat was driven primarily by the C2 coronary intravascular lithotripsy catheter—used to break up hard materials that restrict blood flow to the heart—as it makes solid progress capturing share from stenting cases. We believe the profit cycle opportunity for C2 is meaningful given its large addressable market ($4 billion).”12. Bruker Corporation (NASDAQ:BRKR)Market Cap as of November 18: $9.74 B Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Bruker Corporation (NASDAQ:BRKR) manufactures scientific equipment and diagnostic tests for the life sciences, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology sectors.

We purchased the ADR, which has declined meaningfully (-31% year-to-date) along with the British pound. While Smith &amp; Nephew’s stock is priced in pounds, its revenues are in other major currencies, such as the dollar, euro, and yen. In 2021, 51% of its revenues were generated in the United States, while 31% were in other developed markets. We believe Smith &amp; Nephew is a high-quality business that generates above average profit margins and abundant free cash flow.

Management cited a host of challenges, including COVID19 impacts, especially in China with restrictions and lockdowns under their zero-COVID policy, a weaker economic environment, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and the war in Ukraine, to name a few. Tough comparisons were also a reality— Invisalign case starts in 1Q22 were roughly flat, having lapped the 66% growth from the prior year. It’s not completely surprising that growth is slowing on such tough comparisons, but the company’s shares declined on the news..…."" (Click here to read the full text)8. Abiomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD)Market Cap as of November 18: $16.99 B Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Abiomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD) is a company that conducts research, develops, and sells medical devices that help or take the place of a failing heart's pumping action. The company offers the Impella CP, a tool used by cardiac surgeons and interventional cardiologists to help patients in cath labs, and the Impella 2.5, a percutaneous micro heart pump with an inbuilt motor and sensors.Following the declaration that Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has acquired all the outstanding shares of Abiomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD), Morgan Stanley analyst Cecilia Furlong upgraded the stock of Abiomed (ABMD) to ‘Equal Weight’ on November 2 from ‘Underweight’ with a $380 price target, up from $235.Hedge fund interest in Abiomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD) increased in September 2022. 34 hedge funds in our database reported owning stakes in the company at the end of the third quarter, compared to 30 in the previous quarter.7. Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD)Market Cap as of November 18: $20.66 B Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) manufactures insulin delivery devices for people with diabetes. It provides a wireless companion, portable personal diabetes management, and the Omnipod System. This self-adhesive disposable tubeless Omnipod gadget is worn on the body and is sustainable for up to three days at a time.Following Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD)'s Q3 earnings beat and revised FY22 projection, BTIG analyst Marie Thibault increased his price objective on the stock to $320 from $285 on November 11 and retained a ‘Buy’ rating. In addition, as of the end of the third quarter, 39 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had owned stakes in Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD), compared to just 34 funds in the previous quarter.In its Q1 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments mentioned Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD). Here is what the firm said:“Health care has always been a core foundation of the portfolio and we have been diversifying our health care exposure to include services and solutions beyond our traditional overweight to biopharmaceuticals and managed care. We first purchased Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD), a leading provider of insulin pumps for diabetes patients, in the fourth quarter of 2021, and we have aggressively added to the position since then. The company is currently the only meaningful manufacturer of patch pumps, the preferred form factor for many patients as compared to traditional tubed pumps. We believe Insulet has a long runway for growth given its large and underpenetrated market, which is only one-third penetrated in Type 1 diabetes and low-single-digit penetrated in the insulin- intensive Type 2 diabetes population. Additionally, we see the launch of the company’s next generation offering, Omnipod 5, which received FDA clearance in January, as an accelerant to growth. Insulet has strong gross margins and is profitable today, though we still see room for significant operating margin expansion ahead.”6. Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH)Market Cap as of November 18: $23.53 B Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH) develops, produces, and sells orthopedic reconstructive implants, orthopedic supplies and surgical equipment. The majority of the reconstructive market in the US, Europe, and Japan is presently owned by Zimmer as a result of the acquisitions of Centerpulse in 2003 and Biomet in 2015.On November 3, Citi analyst Joanne Wuensch retained a ‘Neutral’ rating on the shares of Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH) and cut her price objective from $119 to $116. Wuensch claimed that the orthopedic industry was among the most hit by the pandemic since elective procedures were put off and recovery was challenging.At the end of the third quarter of this year, 37 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH), compared to 41 funds in the previous quarter. Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) and Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) are met by Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH) in our list of biggest medical devices stocks.In its Q4 2021 investor letter, Ariel Investments mentioned Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH). Here is what the fund said:“A reopening of the global economy with a reduction in the severity of the pandemic has led us to invest in companies that would perform well with an end to Covid restrictions such as canceled sports and entertainment events or companies that would benefit from pent-up demand for consumer products. Healthcare holdings such as Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. (ZBH) saw demand for their “elective” healthcare services decline sharply as hospitals lost capacity for non-essential surgeries or orthotics. We believed those companies should see a rebound in their business as cases decline. Unfortunately, two new Covid variants turned this theme from a tailwind to a headwind in the second half of the year. First, Delta then Omicron sent Covid cases higher and both companies saw their businesses slow again. Zimmer’s stock lost -13.04% in the fourth quarter. As we write, we believe Omicron cases could be nearing a peak which would allow our thesis to better play out this year.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest Medical Device Companies in the World. Suggested articles:12 Most Active Stocks To BuyTop 10 Clothing Companies in the WorldBiggest Beauty Companies in the WorldDisclosure: None. 15 Biggest Medical Device Companies in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

That’s because depressed stock valuations offer investors better entry points and, thus, the chance for higher potential gains when stocks eventually rebound.Of course, after the beating investors have taken in 2022, it’s only natural they would be more risk-averse than usual. As one trader put it, “The stock market is the only market where things go on sale and all the customers run out of the store.”For traders who are looking to put some capital to work in potential multibagger high-growth stocks, start with the three companies below. Each generates solid cash flow, sports a strong balance sheet, and has tailwinds that should carry its shares higher over the near, medium and long term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOXYOccidental Petroleum$71.46THTarget Hospitality$12.87MROMarathon Oil$31.30Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp.

Schneider / Shutterstock.comFirst on my list of multibagger high-growth stocks to buy is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). I’ve been bullish on the oil and gas producer for quite some time, and for good reason. This company is essentially a cash flow machine, producing record profits as energy prices soared. It’s also one of the best value stocks on the market, trading at just 7.3 times earnings despite the 144% advance in shares this year.OXY has attracted the attention of Warren Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha has been buying shares hand over fist. At last count, he owned a nearly 21% stake in the company. And if that’s not enough to convince you to buy shares, Occidental’s financials should do the trick.The company reported four consecutive quarters of record earnings through Q2 2022. For the third quarter, the company reported $2.5 billion in profits, nearly 300% higher compared with the same quarter last year. Q3 revenue was up nearly 40% to $19.5 billion. These are the kind of numbers you might expect from a tech company.Story continuesFor the full year, analysts expect Occidental will pump out $9.94 per share in earnings. That would represent an increase of 290% over 2021. And they forecast revenue will jump 43% to $37.6 billion.For investors looking for multibagger high-growth stocks, Occidental is a no-brainer.Target Hospitality (TH)AHT stock: the front of a hotel with ornate columnsSource: ShutterstockTarget Hospitality (NASDAQ:TH) offers investors exposure to a unique business model in the rental real estate market. The company owns, constructs and operates a wide range of rental accommodations, including hotels and temporary housing units, primarily serving the energy and government sectors. It also provides hospitality services, such as culinary, concierge, laundry and security services, in addition to recreational facilities.TH stock is up more than 260% so far this year. Much of this can be attributed to the massive run-up in shares in early July. This followed news that the company expanded its lease and services agreement with the U.S. government to provide support for around 6,400 displaced people, about 60% more than the original contract. More recently, the company secured an exclusive 11-year partnership with a national nonprofit to continue providing critical humanitarian services for the Expanded Humanitarian Community.For the third quarter, Target Hospitality saw revenue surge 79% year over year to a record $159.6 million. Net income was up 184% from a year ago to $19 million. For the full year, analysts forecast revenue growth of nearly 71% to $497.8 billion. And they’re calling for EPS to swing from a 5-cent loss in 2021 to 93 cents in 2022 and $1.80 in 2023. At present, shares sit nearly 18% below their 52-week high, providing a great buying opportunity. TH stock isn’t recession-proof, but I think it will provide mutlibagger returns for investors over the long term.Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil Logo at the top of a mobile device.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comIt’s no mistake that Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) is the second major oil producer on this list of multibagger high-growth stocks. Shares are up more than 90% this year thanks in large part to the company’s massive profit growth.Yet, even with this big run-up, I’m not sure energy names like Occidental and Marathon get enough love as growth plays. Perhaps that’s because their low valuations are so low. Trading at only 6.3 times earnings, MRO is even cheaper than OXY (likely due to OXY’s Buffett premium).MRO also offers a higher forward dividend yield at 1.1% versus 0.7% for OXY. However, I could easily see both companies paying out a special dividend in the near future given how much cash they are raking in. For its part, Marathon has grown its earnings by more than 60%, on average, over the past five years.Investors are likely to continue to reward Marathon’s impressive growth.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

(NYSE:MSI) will increase its dividend on the 13th of January to $0.88, which is 11% higher than last year's payment from the same period of $0.79. Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 1.2% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions Motorola Solutions' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsIf it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. Based on the last payment, Motorola Solutions was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 66.6%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 31%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendMotorola Solutions Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2012, the dividend has gone from $0.88 total annually to $3.16. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 14% a year over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Motorola Solutions has impressed us by growing EPS at 12% per year over the past five years. Earnings are on the uptrend, and it is only paying a small portion of those earnings to shareholders.Motorola Solutions Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.

34,1a0f4b66-a50b-36cb-9d40-0c8d056dc0dc,WBA,2022-11-21,Noticing lots of security locks at drugstores? These L.A. stores lock up the most,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/noticing-lots-security-locks-drugstores-130023730.html,1669035623.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[ (Jim Cooke / Los Angeles Times; photos: Getty Images)While shopping for decongestant at Walmart in Burbank, Michelle Krider ran into a frustrating sign of the times: The nasal spray was on a shelf, locked beyond plexiglass.To get the decongestant, the Glendale resident had to press a red button on an electronic device mounted nearby that would summon a store worker to open the case.But her patience ran out within two minutes, and she walked away before an employee could respond.It's a common problem as store managers add more and more security measures.Where once only expensive booze and electronics were locked up, now basic household items such as allergy medicine, shaving razors, infant formula and batteries are ending up in plexiglass cases or behind security devices. More merchandise also has been moved to displays behind cashier counters.Getting those products requires the help of increasingly scarce retail workers.""Sometimes you have to call [for a store employee] and if they are busy, you have to wait,"" said Angela Hakopyan, who was shopping for flu medicine at a Burbank Walgreens. ""If I really need something, I wait. It's annoying.""Batteries are locked inside a glass showcase at a Ralphs market in Calabasas. Retail chains are adding more security measures to combat theft. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)Industry experts and retail companies say the security measures are a response to rising retail crime.""More people are stealing and stealing more,"" said Read Hayes, a criminologist at the University of Florida and director of the Loss Prevention Research Council, an industry research group studying retail theft.But a Times survey — albeit unscientific — of Los Angeles area drugstores suggests it's not a straightforward equation, with stores in higher-income areas locking up fewer of the types of items that are most often stolen, even where the property crime rate is higher.In so doing, critics say, chains discriminate against lower-income neighborhoods where most of the residents are people of color, creating an additional burden for shoppers there.The dollar amount lost to retail theft is hard to measure but the National Retail Federation's annual report estimated that at least $35 billion worth of products were lost in 2021 to shoplifting and theft by organized groups.Story continuesThe trade association has noted that shoplifting and organized theft amount to less than 1%  of sales, but its members have identified it as a ""ballooning issue."" Retailers in the U.S. reported a 27% increase in retail crime incidents in 2021, according to a survey of retailers by the trade group.The problem has been particularly acute in Los Angeles, which for the last four years has been identified by the National Retail Federation as the city with the worst organized retail crime problem, ahead of San Francisco/Oakland, New York and Houston. Organized retail crime goes beyond opportunistic shoplifting and includes black-market syndicates that resell stolen items in bulk at flea markets or to online sellers.Those losses and the added cost of security measures are passed on to shoppers in the form of higher prices, although what you pay at the store is influenced by a host of factors, including rising labor costs, retail industry experts said.""Retailers try to keep costs low for consumers but all of these investments have to be paid somehow,” said Jason Straczewski, vice president for government affairs for the National Retail Federation.Added to the cost of product loss and new security measures is the decline in sales when shoppers like Krider don't make a purchase because they are fed up by the wait to open a locked showcase or remove a security device, according to industry experts.""Customers are frustrated, employees are frustrated and the retailers are frustrated,"" Straczewski said.Pharmacies and drugstores have been among the hardest-hit retail outlets because they often carry high-value, easy-to-conceal items that can be easily resold, according to experts and industry reports. Making matters worse for pharmacy customers is a national shortage of pharmacists due to increased burnout and the pressure added by the pandemic. That means longer wait times to pick up medications.To get a sense of which stores are adopting the greatest number of security measures, The Times surveyed Southern California locations for the nation's four largest pharmacies and drugstores: CVS Pharmacy, Rite Aid, Walgreens and Walmart. The four companies combined account for about 70% of the nation's pharmacy and drug sales, according to the market research company IBIS World.The Times visited 15 stores throughout Santa Monica, South Gate, Burbank, Glendale, Pasadena and Monrovia to compare the security measures in upper-income and middle- and working-class neighborhoods. We checked to see whether security measures were put on 15 individual items that were included in a list by the National Retail Federation of the top targets of organized retail crime. We added to the list a few that are often locked up in Southern California stores, such as Tide detergent pods and teeth whitening strips.The survey was limited and by no means scientific, but the results give a sense of the kinds of items that retailers are locking up and how security measures vary by neighborhood.The items most likely to be locked or put out of reach behind a cashier's counter are printer ink cartridges, phone charging cords and razor blades, followed by perfume, cologne and infant formula.Walgreens put security devices on more of the products we surveyed than the other three retail chains, an average of ten out of 15 items. Rite Aid had the least number of security measures, an average of seven out of 15 store items.Among the CVS and Rite Aid stores, the number of products with added security measures was higher at the stores in South Gate, where the median household income is $55,084, compared with stores in Santa Monica, where the median household income is $98,300. However, South Gate's property crime rate — 3177.10 per 100,000 residents — is lower than Santa Monica's property crime rate of 4138.55 per 100,000 residents, according to FBI crime statistics from 2020. The CVS store in South Gate had security measures added on 13 out of 15 items compared with nine items in its Santa Monica store. The Rite Aid store in South Gate had security measures added on eight out of 15 items compare with six out of 15 items in the Santa Monica store. The Walgreens in Santa Monica and South Gate had the same number of items with added security, 11.Although the number of items with added security measures varied very little among the Walmart stores we surveyed, we noted that all the outlets had partitioned off a portion of their pharmacy departments where high-priced health and beauty products are sold. If shoppers want to buy expensive cosmetics or shampoos they must enter the partitioned area and pay a cashier before leaving through a narrow exit back to the rest of the store. ""No retailer is immune from theft, and Walmart isn’t any different,"" Walmart spokesperson Charles Crowson said in a statement. ""However, we don’t discuss specific details of illegal activity or security situations in our stores.""The survey also uncovered seemingly bewildering security policies: Men's razors were locked up at a Walgreens in South Gate but the women's razors, which were priced about the same, were not. The Walgreens in South Gate also put dandruff shampoo in locked showcases but not regular shampoo. Men's underwear is locked up at several Walmart stores. To buy underwear at the Walmart store in Burbank, we had to wait 8½ minutes to get an associate to open the plexiglass case.The number and types of security measures used in each store vary based on the crime problems in those stores, according to retail chain representatives and law enforcement experts.""Different products experience different theft rates, depending on store location and other factors, affecting which products — and how — they are protected from theft at each store,"" CVS spokesperson Mike DeAngelis said.But community activists say the extra security measures adopted by retailers in some low-income neighborhoods are frustrating and often not justified by crime rates.""Latino and African American neighborhoods have been racially profiled to have extra security measures in the stores that I believe aren't even warranted,"" said Najee Ali, a social and political activist in South Los Angeles.The increase in retail crime has been blamed on several factors, including the financial blow of the pandemic and the resulting job losses, a recent surge in inflation and a growing perception that police and prosecutors won't pursue petty crimes such as shoplifting, according to Hayes and other industry experts. Flash mobs that raid stores have also been on the rise.Razor blades have extra security measures at a CVS store in Woodland Hills. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)A tight labor market has aggravated the situation, making it more difficult for retail outlets to hire enough workers to keep an eye out for shoplifters or to answer customer requests for help getting a product. Keeping a worker employed in a store with a serious crime problem is not easy.""If someone walks in and fills a garbage bag with stuff, employees don't want to work there,"" Hayes said. ""They don't feel safe.""The problem has become so severe that Rite Aid executives recently groused that the ""shrink"" at Rite Aid stores was $5 million higher than in the previous three months and had forced the company to consider extreme measures. The company is in the midst of closing 145 stores in 17 states as part of a larger cost-cutting move.""We're looking at literally putting everything behind showcases to ensure the products [are] there for customers who want to buy it,"" Andre Persaud, the company's chief retail officer, said during a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss earnings. ""And then lastly, we've even had to go to the extent of using off-duty police officers in some of our stores.""Last year, Walgreens said it was closing an additional five stores in San Francisco, bringing the number of shuttered locations to 22 in the last several years, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The company cited “organized retail crime” for some of the closings.""It's changing the shopping experience and causing stores to close their doors,"" said Jason Daughrity, coordinator for the state's Organized Retail Crime Task Force, created in 2019 and managed by the California Highway Patrol.The retailers don't always install extra security measures on the highest-priced items. At the Rite Aid store in Glendale, a Gillette pack of men's razors, priced at $12.39, was locked behind plexiglass but a generic brand of razors displayed nearby and priced at $35.99 was not.Hayes said retailers make decisions on what items to add security measures to based on how often the items are stolen and which stores have the highest rates of theft. ""No one can afford to treat every item in every location the same,"" he said.Items including razor blades, medications, ink cartridges and cologne are often stolen because they have six criminal-pleasing characteristics that the industry has dubbed CRAVED: concealable, removable, available, valuable, enjoyable and disposable. By nabbing small, high-priced, easy-to-steal items, thieves minimize the risk of getting caught while maximizing the benefit of getting away with the crime.Stolen items may end up being sold in bulk at flea markets or online platforms such as Facebook Marketplace, OfferUp, Craigslist or EBay, Daughrity said. Some criminals operate storefronts in residential homes to sell the stolen items and even place orders with shoplifters for products that have yet to be stolen, he said.""Wherever there is theft, chances are there is a willing buyer,"" Daughrity said.Shoplifters working with organized retail crime rings will often enter a store with an empty garbage bag, which they will open under a shelf of valuable products, Hayes said. With a quick sweep of an arm, thieves can scoop dozens of items off a shelf and into the bag and sprint out of the store in seconds, he said.As an apparent deterrent, Walgreens has begun displaying deodorant and body wash on shelves behind plastic barriers that are not locked but require shoppers to push them aside to get to the merchandise.Walgreens wouldn't discuss its specific theft-deterrent measures but said in a statement: ""We take a multifaceted approach to deter theft and combat organized retail crime. For example, data-driven measures like installing anti-theft devices and security personnel helps to improve on-shelf availability of products for customers in stores.""In a statement, Rite Aid said, ""we are seeing a higher level of brazen shoplifting and organized retail crime, and we are taking an active role in helping the police in their pursuit of shoplifters.""Nearly 45% of retailers who responded to a recent survey by the National Retail Federation said they were increasing their budgets to fight shoplifting. About 40% of retailers in the survey said they are adding or plan to add radio frequency identification tags, which can be attached to an item to locate it and identify if the item is stolen. Nearly 18% of those surveyed said they plan to or are adding more locked cases to display products.But there is a cost to adding so many theft deterrents: Hayes and other retail crime experts say legitimate shoppers are likely to stay away from stores with too many security measures, especially on low-priced items.As he stood outside the Walgreens in Santa Monica recently, Bill Robins frowned. ""It's a hassle,"" he said. ""So many items require you to ask for assistance before you can buy them."" He didn't care that the stores were trying to protect their most commonly stolen items.""It feels like it's almost everything you buy here,"" he said, ""even razor blades.""This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

Inclusion in the “Dow 30” is considered to be prestigious and a sign that a company is a leading business. This helps to explain why many of the oldest companies in the U.S. are part of the Dow. And, to be sure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has a track record of outperforming other indexes during a downturn. This year, for example, the Dow has declined 8% compared to an 18% drop in the S&amp;P 500 index and a 30% pullback in the Nasdaq. That said, not every stock included in the Dow is a winner. Some of the companies included in the index have been real stinkers, with a few underperforming for long stretches of time. Here are three Dow stocks to sell right now… and one to buy.BABoeing$173DOWDow, Inc.$49.60WBAWalgreens Boots Alliance$40MCDMcDonald’s$273.50Dow Stocks to Sell Right Now: Boeing (BA)Boeing (BA) passenger airplane with open exit door, passenger windows, cargo door, close up view of Boeing logoSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock.comAmerican aircraft manufacturer Boeing (NYSE:BA) has done its best to put the multiple crashes of its 737 MAX aircraft behind it. The company moved its headquarters from Chicago to Arlington, Virginia and made multiple financial settlements, including establishing a $500 million fund to compensate the families of those who died in the crashes, and paying nearly $2 billion in government fines and compensation to airlines whose aircraft orders were delayed.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, the company’s stock has not yet recovered from the ordeal. Over the past five years, BA stock has lost 34% of its value and now trades at $173 a share. Investors who’ve hung on waiting for the stock to recover have been disappointed.To be sure, the company remains one of only two, major aircraft manufacturers in the world along with Airbus SE (EPA:AIR) of France. And the company continues to get robust orders for its aircraft. But it seems that investors’ trust in Boeing has been irrevocably shaken.Story continuesDow Inc. (DOW)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comMichigan-based chemical company Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) was spun off by DowDuPont in 2019, which is when Dow Inc became a publicly traded company and its stock was promptly added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Since its IPO three years ago, DOW stock has only gained a slight 3%. At its current price of $49.60, the stock is trading only $1 above the $48.60 per share price at which it closed on its first trading day.Dow is extremely diversified, making products ranging from artificial turf and the stuff found in golf balls to adhesives, coatings, herbicides, insecticides, and chemicals used in automotive manufacturing. And the company is profitable and a market leader. It just reported a third-quarter profit of $739 million, or $1.02 per share, ahead of Wall Street analysts’ average forecasts.But it seems that DOW stock has had trouble capturing the interest of investors. As a result, the share price seems to be treading water, making it a Dow stock to sell right now.Dow Stocks to Sell Right Now: Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comRetail pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) has been a chronic underperformer. Over the past five years, the company’s stock is down 43%. WBA stock hit an all-time high of nearly $100 in 2015. Since then, it has been all down hill for the company and its shareholders. Today Walgreens’ stock trades at $40.The lack of progress by the shares appears to be the result of WBA’s low rate of diversification and its failed attempts at innovation. As if to compensate for years of underperformance, Walgreens has been in overdrive lately, announcing in 2021 that it would spend $5.2 billion to purchase the primary care company VillageMD, and announcing a plan to open 1,000 VillageMD primary care locations in its outlets by 2027. While the initiatives are aimed at reinvigorating Walgreens Boots Alliance and WBA stock, the aggressive moves seem to have had the opposite affect, spooking investors and analysts who are concerned about overspending and an overly aggressive expansion. One Dow Stock To Buy Right Now: McDonald’s (MCD)A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.comThe Golden Arches is a pretty safe bet. Even when the economy is in a slowdown or it’s shut down, as was the case during the pandemic, people still enjoy their McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) meals. That loyalty helps to power McDonald’s sales and stock through boom and bust cycles. This year, MCD stock is up 2%.While that might not sound impressive, it is when one considers that the S&amp;P 500 index is down 18% on the year. Over the past 12 months, McDonald’s stock has gained nearly 10% (again, that’s better than most stocks have done), and the share price is up 62% over five years.In addition to its loyal customers, McDonald’s also benefits from a culture of innovation and the fact that the company is constantly experimenting and changing its menu. Currently, McDonald’s is undertaking a farewell tour for the much beloved McRib sandwich, testing Krispy Kreme doughnuts at its locations, and has launched a line of Happy Meals targeted at adults.Plus, the company just reported an earnings print that beat Wall Street’s average expectations — again. Globally, the company’s same-store sales rose 10% year-over-year in Q3. That’s not bad, since we’re in the midst of a rapidly slowing global economy.The bottom line is that McDonald’s is a reliable blue-chip stock that provides consistent returns to shareholders in any type of market. Consequently, MCD stock is a buy.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

36,51f35d1c-9faa-3f4d-b41d-f3673272c6e8,SBUX,2022-11-21,Disney’s Bob Iger isn’t the first ‘Boomerang CEO’ brought back to save a struggling company. History suggests he won’t have an easy time,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-bob-iger-isn-t-084905060.html,1669020545,STORY,"['DIS', 'SBUX']","[By re-hiring Bob Iger, the Walt Disney Company's board is following a well-established strategy to save a floundering company: bring back the last successful CEO.On Sunday night, Disney’s board announced that Iger would return as CEO of Disney, ousting current CEO Bob Chapek, who himself replaced Iger in 2020.Iger now joins a list of so-called boomerang CEOs that includes Apple’s Steve Jobs, Bloomberg’s Michael Bloomberg, Starbucks’ Howard Schultz, Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, Reddit's Steve Huffman, and many other former leaders enticed back to the corner office.Iger served as Disney’s CEO from 2005 to 2020, during which the entertainment company’s market capitalization increased by five times. Iger was responsible for Disney’s acquisition strategy—snapping up Pixar, Marvel Entertainment, Lucasfilm, and 21st Century Fox—which helped make the company a content giant.But the experience of other so-called ‘Boomerang CEOs’ shows that once-successful leaders might stumble the second time around, with one study finding that companies that bring back CEOs do worse than those that bring in someone new.‘Boomerang’ CEOsThe record posted by 'Boomerang CEOs' is decidedly mixed.One of the most successful was Apple founder Steve Jobs, who returned to lead the tech company in 1997 after being forced out as CEO 12 years earlier. Jobs’ second stint in leadership helped transform the nearly-bankrupt Apple into one of the world’s largest—if not the largest—companies by market capitalization, on the back of devices like the iPod and iPhone.Another successful boomerang CEO was Starbucks’ Howard Schultz, who first led the coffee chain between 1986 and 2000. Schultz returned as CEO in 2008 during the Global Financial Crisis, as the company was losing market share to cheaper providers like Dunkin’ Donuts. Schultz’s second stint is credited with turning around Starbucks’ fortunes, with the company’s share price tripling between 2008 and 2017, when Schultz handed the CEO position to Kevin Johnson.Story continuesBut other returning CEOs have floundered.Chipotle founder Steve Ells returned to lead the food chain in 2016 in the wake of well-publicized food safety scandals. Yet Ells struggled to rebuild public trust in Chipotle, and he resigned as CEO a year later.Jack Dorsey, who was pushed out by Twitter's board in 2008, returned as CEO in 2015. Yet Twitter was criticized for its content moderation policies during Dorsey's second run, such as the company's shifting views on whether to allow then-President Donald Trump on the platform. And during his return, Twitter posted annual losses in all but two years. Dorsey stepped down as CEO last year, and was a behind-the-scenes supporter of Elon Musk's chaotic drive to buy Twitter earlier this year.Even Schultz, who returned in March as Starbucks CEO for a third time and is acting in an interim capacity until Laxman Narasimhan takes over as CEO next April, has had his problems. Shareholders are less enthusiastic about Schultz’s third mandate, demanding that Starbucks implement better succession planning. And Schultz's aggressive handling of a unionization movement at the chain's stores has led to tensions with Starbucks' workforce and legal trouble.Board hopesBoards argue that established leaders can help fix a company’s direction in tough times, and Disney's board is no exception. Disney’s decision to bring back Iger comes after a difficult 2022 in which the entertainment giant reported a lower-than-expected $20.2 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, and a $1.5 billion loss from streaming. Disney shares are down 41.4% for the year.“As Disney embarks on an increasingly complex period of industry transformation Bob Iger is uniquely situated to lead the company through this pivotal period,” Disney board chair Susan Arnold said in a statement.Yet evidence suggests that ‘boomerang CEOs’ might constrain a company’s growth. A study published in the MIT Sloan Management Review in 2020 found that companies that brought back a former CEO have ""significantly lower"" stock performance than firms that brought in someone new.The study, led by researchers at the Univeristy of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Marquette University, found that these negative effects were magnified when the company brought back a former founder.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: The American middle class is at the end of an eraSam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire ‘was run by a gang of kids in the Bahamas’ who all dated each otherThe 5 most common mistakes lottery winners makeSick with a new Omicron variant?

(NYSE:PM) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Philip Morris InternationalThe Executive Chairman of the Board, Andre Calantzopoulos, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$8.3m worth of shares at a price of US$111 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$96.28. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Insiders in Philip Morris International didn't buy any shares in the last year.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Philip Morris International insiders own about US$236m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Philip Morris International Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Philip Morris International insider transactions don't fill us with confidence.

Exclusive insights show that while 44% of consumers currently prefer to receive money transfers through digital platforms, almost 70% want to be able to choose how they collect their funds in the future – be it in cash or digitally.The study results, which bolster Western Union’s recently announced ‘Evolve 2025’ (E25) strategy of combining high-value, accessible retail and digital financial services for the world’s aspiring populations, explore consumer sentiment on money movement. More than 2000 consumers across the Philippines who send and receive money internationally were surveyed.""As consumers look to the future, the principle of choice in how to transfer money internationally is most appealing,"" said Jean Claude Farah, President of Middle East and Asia Pacific at Western Union. ""This resonates with what we see among our customer base, who actively seek services that are convenient, fast and reliable, based on their needs.""""It amplifies the need for larger ecosystems, where retail and digital platforms grow and evolve symbiotically,"" Farah added. ""At Western Union, one of the key focus areas to accelerate growth in the Philippines and around the world is just that - to build on our core capabilities so that we can help grow, strengthen and evolve a financial ecosystem that surrounds our customers. Through our omnichannel approach, we believe that we can harness the power of both the physical and digital touchpoints to serve all our customers’ money movement needs.""Story continuesDigital money transfer platforms are used by many, but still not allWorld Bank data shows that the Philippines is the fourth-largest inbound (receiver) market in the world, bringing in USD37 billion in 2021. The Government and Central Bank have made significant strides in driving digital transformation and encouraging inclusion by creating and committing to a clear financial inclusion strategy.Western Union’s study results show, however, that there is still more to do. While many consumers opt to use digital platforms, many others do not.Trust ranks highly as a top barrier for using digital money transfer services among senders (31%) and receivers (23%). Thirty-seven percent of receivers prefer face-to-face interaction, while senders say process or customer experience prevents them from doing so (15%). However, approximately 30% of senders and 14% of receivers do not transfer money online for reasons such as lack of connectivity, limited knowledge of digital services, no online banking history or because they are generally unbanked.Consumers say their remittances set to increaseRising interest rates and increased cost-of-living expenses have driven headlines around the world. Against a backdrop described by the United Nations as the ‘largest cost-of-living crisis of the 21st century,’ consumers in the Philippines have been proactively trying to cope.Keeping pace with daily financial needs, 44% of senders in the Philippines state that family support is the primary driving force behind how much and how frequently they need to transfer money. In line with this, 83% of the country’s receivers agree they need to receive more money to support loved ones and family.Meanwhile senders also struggle with a cost-of-living dichotomy. Seventy-seven percent state that because cost-of-living has increased in the country they send to, they have to transfer more money. Yet 72% state that because cost of living expenses have increased in the country they live in, they are unable to transfer as much as they previously did. With that said, both send and receive consumers agree that they expect transfers to increase in the next 12 months - with 74% of senders and 80% of receivers stating that their flow of money is set to go up.""While many factors contribute to remittance flows, to remit is a personal decision – most commonly to support loved ones and family,"" said Farah. ""So, it follows that in the current economic climate, receivers have strong influence over the frequency and amounts their senders transfer. As the push-pull dynamic changes over time, it is critical that consumers remain armed and supported with the right money transfer tools in their time of need. That is why we are focused on building a modern, adaptable platform that provides a strong user experience for our customers. As we evolve our business strategy in the Philippines, we look forward to creating opportunities for our customers to better manage their financial lives.""Western Union in the PhilippinesWestern Union has been providing money-transfer services in the Philippines for over 30 years and is deeply committed to the country.

42,b213fc56-3200-3709-8598-a61b5449c864,PPG,2022-11-21,"PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) Shares Could Be 27% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ppg-industries-inc-nyse-ppg-104648458.html,1669027608,STORY,['PPG'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for PPG Industries The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.60bUS$1.74bUS$1.86bUS$2.12bUS$2.27bUS$2.39bUS$2.50bUS$2.59bUS$2.67bUS$2.75bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x13Analyst x10Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 7.01%Est @ 5.5%Est @ 4.44%Est @ 3.7%Est @ 3.19%Est @ 2.83% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$15bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.7b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.0%) = US$53bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$53b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$26bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$41b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$128, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 27% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PPG Industries as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.036. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For PPG Industries, there are three important elements you should consider:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for PPG Industries   (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.Future Earnings: How does PPG's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

We've been friends since karting,"" he said. ""Everything he's done I'm very happy for him and I hope we can both be successful coming into F1."" (Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ed Osmond)]"
45,a4e93722-66c6-3454-8c2a-d3041641c1ce,NFLX,2022-11-21,The Return Trends At Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) Look Promising,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/return-trends-netflix-nasdaq-nflx-120227483.html,1669032147,STORY,['NFLX'],"[If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So when we looked at Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Netflix is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.14 = US$5.7b ÷ (US$48b - US$7.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Netflix has an ROCE of 14%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Entertainment industry average of 8.7% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for Netflix roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Netflix compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Netflix.The Trend Of ROCEWe like the trends that we're seeing from Netflix. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 14%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 241%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Netflix thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.One more thing to note, Netflix has decreased current liabilities to 16% of total assets over this period, which effectively reduces the amount of funding from suppliers or short-term creditors. This tells us that Netflix has grown its returns without a reliance on increasing their current liabilities, which we're very happy with.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayA company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Netflix has. Since the stock has returned a solid 47% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.On the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation. That's why we have a FREE intrinsic value estimation on our platform  that is definitely worth checking out.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

48,9c18dbc3-cc76-3921-9755-a75f2098e847,AMGN,2022-11-21,Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 78% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-nasdaq-amgn-largely-140046730.html,1668952846,STORY,['AMGN'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 78% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Amgen, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Amgen ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amgen?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Amgen already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Amgen, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Amgen. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.8% and 5.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of AmgenThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Amgen Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$244m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 22% stake in Amgen. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Amgen  that you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

49,87c7c7ab-2eee-32af-a7c5-1b0075cb2ee4,AMGN,2022-11-21,7 Top-Tier Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-top-tier-dividend-stocks-113033469.html,1668771033,STORY,"['LMT', 'AMGN', 'CMC', 'SBLK', 'ABR-PF', 'DVN', 'FANG']","[In a market like this, you always can find dividend stocks to buy. If you’re like most investors, you probably can’t wait for 2023. History books will show that 2022 was a huge disappointment for the stock market, although it did create some compelling opportunities for top-tier dividend stocks.First of all, dividend stocks are a huge benefit in any portfolio. Dividend stocks pay a quarterly or monthly payment to shareholders, who can use the money for income (a great idea for retirees). Or for younger investors, a regular dividend payment can be reinvested into the market to help grow your portfolio quicker.My Dividend Grader is a great tool to find these top-tier dividend stocks to buy. The Dividend Grader evaluates dividend stocks on a variety of metrics and assigns a letter grade – just like in school, the best dividend stocks get an “A” or “B” rating.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIt’s similar to my Portfolio Grader tool, which also grades stocks based on earnings, analyst sentiment, momentum and qualitative standards.You can find great dividend stocks to buy in a variety of sectors – this list includes defense, energy, biotech, materials and real estate. While the names and sectors vary, all of these stocks have one thing in common – they’re among the best dividend stocks you can buy heading into 2023.LMTLockheed Martin$472.77AMGNAmgen$287.30ABRArbor Realty Trust $14.01SBLKStar Bulk Carriers$19.90FANGDiamondback Energy$161.78CMCCommercial Metals$47.65DVNDevon Energy$70.99Lockheed Martin (LMT)A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comGeopolitical tensions aren’t great for a lot of reasons, but one way to capitalize is defense contractors like Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). Lockheed Martin is one of the biggest and most well-known contractors in the world and is always among the best dividend stocks to buy.While the stock market spent much of 2022 in correction territory, LMT is up more than 30% on the year as the U.S. keeps a wary eye on the war in Ukraine and tensions with China and North Korea.Story continuesNo doubt, Lockheed Martin makes money hand over fist. It brought in $16.58 billion just in the third quarter. While the company narrowly missed estimates of $16,68 billion, that appears to be a minor setback. Lockheed reaffirmed its outlook for the full year, for which it says it expects revenue of $65.25 billion and full-year earnings per share of $21.55.Lockheed provides a solid dividend yield of 2.6%, helping push it to an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader and a “B” rating in my Dividend Grader.Amgen (AMGN)the Amgen (AMGN) logo on a building during daylightSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAs a top biotech stock, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is on the cutting edge of providing treatments for a variety of ailments, including rheumatoid arthritis, bone cancer and psoriasis.While it’s not a household name, Amgen has succeeded in building an impressive pipeline of medications that keeps that revenue and earnings rolling in.Revenue in the third quarter was $6.65 billion, topping estimates by $100 million. Earnings per share were also solid at $4.70 per share, better than the $4.45 that the experts predicted.Meanwhile, the stock is up more than 18% so far this year with most of those gains coming since early September when Amgen impressed investors and analysts alike by unveiling updated long-term positive data about the effectiveness of Repatha drug that is used to treat high cholesterol.AMGN stock has a dividend yield of 2.7%.

One of the best right now is Arbor Realty Trust (NYSE:ABR), which is involved with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan programs, FHA and low-income loans, and bridge loans.Arbor is a real estate investment trust or REIT. REITs are special types of investments because they are required to distribute 90% of their taxable earnings to shareholders. That can create some pretty extraordinary payout ratios and ABR is no exception – currently, it pays a dividend yield of 10.8%.Admittedly, with high interest rates there’s always a risk that the housing market will be slow for a while. But ABR doesn’t seem to be affected by the problem. Arbor topped top- and bottom-line estimates for revenue and EPS in each of the first three quarters.Arbor Realty has a “B” rating in the Dividend Grader.Star Bulk Carriers (SBLK)Plenty of shipping containers stacked at the Port of Hamburg and blue skySource: Hieronymus Ukkel / Shutterstock.comStar Bulk Carriers (NASDAQ:SBLK) has a stock price just under $20, but it paid a mammoth dividend over the last year of $6.55.Its last three quarterly dividends came in at $1.25, $2 and $1.65. So, you’re looking at a dividend yield for SBLK of more than 30% right now.Star Bulk transports dry bulk goods around the world on its fleet of 128 vessels. As the world is still coming to grips with the effects of Covid-19 shutdowns on the supply chain, Star Bulk’s vessels appear to be in demand. That should keep the profits coming in for shareholders.SBLK stock has a “B” rating in my Portfolio Grader and an “A” rating in the Dividend Grader.Diamondback Energy (FANG)diamondback energy logo on its website to represent oil stocksSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comTexas-based Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) is an energy exploration company that is involved with petroleum, natural gas liquids and natural gas.Its holdings are in the Permian Basin in west Texas, where it also recently acquired the assets of Lario Permian, a subsidiary of Lario Oil &amp; Gas Co., in exchange for $850 million plus 4.18 million shares of FANG stock. The deal gives Diamondback access to another 25,000 acres in the Northern Midland Basin. The deal is expected to close in late January.That keeps Diamondback in growth mode. The company reported revenue in Q3 of $2.44 billion, which was more than 30% greater than a year ago. The revenue number also beat analysts’ expectations of $2.42 billion. EPS for the third quarter was also a pleasant surprise, coming in at $6.48 versus expectations of $6.36.FANG stock is up 48% so far this year and offers a dividend yield of 5.3%.

CMC reported revenue of $2.41 billion and EPS of $2.45, versus estimates for $2.37 billion revenue and EPS of $2.23.Commercial Metals stock is up 30% so far this year and has a dividend yield of 1.4%. That gives it “A” grades in both the Dividend Grader and the Portfolio Grader.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comNo stock on this list has grown as much in 2022 as Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN). Fueled by higher oil and natural gas prices, Devon stock is up more than 60% on the year. And even if the globe sinks into a recession, Devon stock should be fine because analysts project crude oil prices to remain high for the next several years.On Nov. 1, Devon announced a dividend of $1.35 per share; a 61% increase from a year ago. That puts Devon’s dividend yield at a whopping 7.3%.The Oklahoma company should also benefit from the Biden administration’s deal with the European Union. Washington wants to reduce the EU’s reliance on Russian natural gas by providing at least 15 billion cubic meters of liquified natural gas in 2022.As long as Russia remains at odds with the west, companies like Devon stand to capitalize in European markets.DNV stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader and the Dividend Grader.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in LMT, AMGN, SBLK, CMC and DVN.

If you want to see more of the fastest growing economies in Africa, go directly to the 5 Fastest Growing Economies in Africa.Africa's economy started recovering in 2021 following the disastrous consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its gross domestic output increased significantly in 2021 by an estimated 6.9%. The anticipated real GDP growth for Africa in 2021 was higher than both the global average and other regions' growth rates. Four of Africa's top six countries had an increase in their Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) readings, indicating an improvement in economic activity. Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa's PMI values in 2021 (which collectively accounted for 52% of Africa's GDP in 2021) were usually over the 50-point threshold and closer to pre-pandemic levels. This comes after the continent saw a 1.6% shrinkage brought on by the pandemic in 2020. North Africa (11.7%) and East Africa (4.8%) had the fastest growth. The increase was ascribed to the recovery in oil prices and global demand as well as the uptick in household spending and investment in the majority of nations following the easing of restrictions.Overall, macroeconomic fundamentals have improved, but there are still many challenges to face in the near future. The global macroeconomic headwinds and instability caused by the war between Russia and Ukraine may cause growth to slow to 4.1% in 2022 and stagnate there in 2023. The PMI rating for four of Africa's six major economies decreased in March 2022 due the start of the Russia-Ukraine war in February 2022.IMF African Department Director Abebe Aemro Selassie thinks that the effects of the Ukraine war — primarily an increase in gasoline and food prices — would be felt by everyone. According to the World Bank, the combined consequences of the Ukraine war, massive debts, and climate change have hampered Africa's economic progress.Story continuesAfrican countries have tremendous economic potential with rewarding opportunities for investors. Therefore, despite so many obstacles, a number of African countries have been able to expand their economies, which was primarily made possible by advances in underlying infrastructure that accelerated the convergence of underdeveloped regions with national levels. Other countries have profited from rising oil prices. For all of the countries on our 12 Fastest Growing Economies in Africa list, each is growing faster than 5% in terms of GDP growth as of 2021.Major global mining companies like Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), and Freeport-McMoRan, Inc. (NYSE:FCX) are also investing heavily in Africa. Technology startups are also sprouting all over the continent, with huge investments from companies like Google, Apple and Amazon.Photo by Jacques Nel on UnsplashMethodologyWe used the data from the World Bank's annual GDP growth 2021 list to compile our ranking of the 12 fastest-growing economies in Africa.Fastest Growing Economies in Africa12. Ethiopia GDP growth in 2021 according to World Bank: 5.64%Ethiopia is the second-most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, with an anticipated 117 million residents in 2021. With 6.1% growth in FY2020/21, it also saw the strongest economic growth on the continent. Ethiopia's economy, however, slowed to 5.6% growth in 2021 due to the civil war and COVID-19's repercussions on the travel and hotel industries. From 20.4% in 2020 to 26.7% in 2021, inflation rose far beyond the central bank's 8% objective. GDP growth is predicted to dip to 4.8% in 2022 before rebounding to 5.7% in 2023, with industry, private consumption, and investment driving development.11. Republic of the CongoGDP growth in 2021 according to World Bank: 5.71%Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) growth had a remarkable comeback, rising from 1.7% in 2020 to a projected 5.7% in 2021, far higher than the 4.5% average in sub-Saharan Africa. The strength of the nation's mining and services sectors was a key factor in the robust rebound. In a setting characterized by the continuance of the COVID-19 epidemic and the worldwide repercussions of the Russia-Ukraine war, the prognosis is encouraging but remains precarious. The accelerated vaccination campaign, increased oil production, and dynamics in the agricultural and mining sectors are projected to stifle GDP growth to 4.3% in 2022 and 3.2% in 2023, respectively.However, the mining sector in the country remain strong and major players like Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), and Freeport-McMoRan, Inc. (NYSE:FCX) are bringing millions in investments.10. ZimbabweGDP growth in 2021 according to World Bank: 5.85%Zimbabwe's economic growth accelerated to an anticipated 5.9% in 2021 from a 6.2% fall in 2020 due to a bountiful harvest that expanded agriculture by 36.2% in 2021 as opposed to 4.2% growth in 2020. The per capita GDP also increased, jumping by 4.9% in 2021 after declining by 6.7% in 2020. However, in 2022, economic growth was held down by unstable prices and deteriorating agricultural circumstances. The real GDP growth rate is anticipated to decrease from 5.8% in 2021 to 3.4% in 2022.9. SenegalGDP growth in 2021 according to World Bank: 6.06%Senegal stands ninth on the list of 12 of the fastest growing economies in Africa. With 6.1% growth in 2021 compared to 1.3% in 2020, the economy started to recover, in part because of the Adjusted and Accelerated Priority Action Plan. The return of the extractive industry, building and commercial activities related to high demand, as well as transportation services, were the main drivers of this growth. The recovery is predicted to slow down in 2022 to 4.6% owing to the consequences of the Russia-Ukraine war. However, it is estimated to rebound in 2023 to 8.2% thanks to governmental and private investments as well as increased oil and gas extraction. Oil and food prices will rise, causing inflation to reach 3.2% in 2022 before dropping to 2.2% in 2023.8. BeninGDP growth in 2021 according to World Bank: 6.60%The cornerstones of Benin's economy continue to be agriculture and transit trade with Nigeria, both official and unofficial. The GDP growth rate for Benin increased to 6.6% in 2021 from 3.8% in 2020. The major forces behind this expansion were the service and construction industries. Inflationary pressures have increased significantly since the end of 2021, when annual inflation was only 1.7% on average. Since the beginning of the crisis in Ukraine, inflation has intensified and is being driven by increasing food and petroleum product costs. In 2022 and 2023, growth is expected to be 6.1% and 6.4%, respectively. These predictions rely on changes in the corporate environment, governmental financial management, and agriculture sector governance.7. Burkina Faso GDP growth in 2021 according to World Bank: 6.90%In 2021, Burkina Faso's economy saw a remarkable recovery, expanding by an estimated 6.9%. The recovery in the service sector (+10.4%) and the continued rise in gold exports were the main drivers of this expansion. The primary sector contracted by 4.1% as a result of the drop in agricultural production brought on by the lack of rain. In 2021, the gold industry helped exports grow by 6.5%, while imports increased by 15.5%, primarily as a result of increases in the price of hydrocarbons and electricity. In 2022, the predicted rate of growth is 4.3%. This slowdown in GDP can be attributed to a number of factors, including the decline in private investment, the rise of insecurity in some mining and agricultural areas, and the Russia-Ukraine war and its effects on prices for food, fertilizer, and petroleum products.6. MoroccoGDP growth in 2021 according to World Bank: 7.37%Morocco is a North African country known for its agriculture, phosphate minerals, and tourism. Following Morocco's first recession in 20 years, export performance, the low-base effect, and an outstanding 2020–21 agricultural season all contributed to GDP growth of 7.37% in 2021. However, a sudden downturn in economic activity brought on by a variety of concurrent reasons led to GDP growth falling to just 0.3% in the first quarter of 2022. Another drought, the third in the preceding four years, and its repercussions, were to blame for this. Furthermore, because it imports food and energy, Morocco has suffered greatly from the increases in commodity prices brought on by the crisis in Ukraine.As the African economy comes back to normal, major mining companies like Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), and Freeport-McMoRan, Inc. (NYSE:FCX) are beginning to operate in the continent with huge resources. Click to continue reading and see 5 Fastest Growing Economies in Africa. Suggested articles:10 Best Fast Growth Stocks To Buy10 Most Promising Gene Therapy CompaniesDividend Kings List By YieldDisclosure: None. 12 Fastest Growing Economies in Africa is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At General DynamicsThe Senior VP, Gregory Gallopoulos, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.5m worth of shares at a price of US$228 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$248, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 8.0% of Gregory Gallopoulos's stake. Gregory Gallopoulos was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.Gregory Gallopoulos divested 21.77k shares over the last 12 months at an average price of US$233.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. General Dynamics insiders own about US$4.3b worth of shares (which is 6.3% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At General Dynamics Tell Us?The fact that there have been no General Dynamics insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of General Dynamics, we can't say the same about the selling of shares.

(NYSE:ZTS) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Zoetis The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At ZoetisOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the CEO &amp; Director, Kristin Peck, for US$562k worth of shares, at about US$225 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$146).

View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy NextEra Energy Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider James Robo made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.0m worth of shares at a price of US$77.26 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$83.20. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed.

Passive income always represents an attractive attribute but that’s only half of the story. The other half centers on sustainability of said income, which is where the payout ratio comes into play.Essentially, this metric represents the proportion of earnings from which a company pays its shareholders in the form of dividends. While no absolute rules exist, generally speaking, the lower the range of the payout ratio, the higher probability that the underlying dividends are sustainable. Therefore, dividend stocks with low payout ratios – but still commanding relatively high yields – bring much to the table.Of course, you’re going to have to work with me on this list. Typically, the higher the reward, the greater the risk. Nevertheless, I’ve put together an eclectic mix of dividend stocks with low payout ratios that should help investors ride out the current storm.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTGTTarget$160.31MTBM&amp;T Bank$167.26TSNTyson Foods$65.03HPQHP Inc.$29.26CAGConagra$34.88OMCOmnicom$76.15IBMIBM.$145.77Target (TGT)Source: ShutterstockGoing speculative as the lead-off name for this list of dividend stocks with low payout ratios, Target (NYSE:TGT) immediately draws concerns. Fundamentally, the current pensive environment resulted in consumer sentiment slipping near historic lows. What’s more, Target recently warned of a weak holiday sales cycle, sending shares down 13% for the Nov. 16 session.If that wasn’t bad enough, management also mentioned that organized retail crime sparked $400 million in extra profit loss. Obviously, the big-box retailer isn’t having a great time. Nevertheless, adventurous investors may want to target TGT as one of the dividend stocks with low payout ratios to buy.For one thing, in the trailing month, the stock actually gained slightly over 4%. Therefore, it’s possible that the volatility represented a one-and-done move. More to the point, Target offers a forward yield of 2.78%, ranking above the consumer staples average yield of 1.89%. In addition, its payout ratio of 36.28% should be sustainable, irrespective of recent woes.Story continuesM&amp;T Bank (MTB)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Headquartered in Buffalo, New York, M&amp;T Bank (NYSE:MTB) is a regional financial institution. The firm features 780 branches in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Fundamentally, regional banks may be somewhat insulated than their larger multinational peers as they focus on local communities. That’s especially true with people concerned about a global slowdown.MTB also attracts attention because it’s one of the dividend stocks with low payout ratios. Per Dividend.com, M&amp;T Bank features a forward yield of 2.85%. To be completely transparent, this figure rates lower than the sector average yield of 3.18%. But hear me out. The payout ratio sits at 24.75%, reflecting a sustainable and dependable flow of passive income.As well, the company carries a cash-to-debt ratio of 6.32 times, ranking higher than 77.5% of the competition. Also, its equity-to-asset ratio stands at 0.13 times, beating out the industry median of 0.09 times.Tyson Foods (TSN)A package of Tyson Foods (TSN) chicken breasts.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comAlthough a relevant company because of its indelible products, Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) embodies another enterprise loaded with distractions. This time, it’s of management’s doing, with the company’s CFO arrested for a trespassing and intoxication incident. Still, if you can get over this blight, an argument exists for TSN as one of the dividend stocks with low payout ratios to considerPer Dividend.com, Tyson offers a forward yield of 2.98%. Conspicuously, this ranks higher than the sector average of 1.89%. In addition, the payout ratio sits at a pedestrian 26.87%. As well, Tyson enjoys 10 years of consecutive dividend increases. While it’s not a Target – which has 50 years – the food processor is on a roll. Certainly, management will not want to give it up, especially since it needs to shape up.Financially, investors can take confidence that Tyson enjoys solid profit margins. As well, its return on equity (ROE) stands at 22.3%, reflecting a high-quality business. Even with all these positive attributes, TSN trades for only 8.4-times forward earnings, which is blisteringly cheap.HP (HPQ)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comGiven the aforementioned troubles in the consumer economy, it’s not particularly surprising that HP (NYSE:HPQ) struggled this year. Since the January opener, shares gave up 23% of equity value. With the underlying business focusing on personal computers, printers, and 3D printing solutions, HP needs sentiment to pick up. Interestingly, though, shares gained 14% in the trailing month.If you happen to own the conviction that most of the bad news already baked itself into HPQ, then you may want to consider its proposition as one of the dividend stocks with low payout ratios. Per Dividend.com, the company carries a forward yield of 3.41%. That’s much higher than the technology sector average of 1.37%. Additionally, the payout ratio sits at 27.57%, a sustainable level.As well, investors should note that the company owns 12 years of consecutive dividend increases. Again, it’s not a track record that management will give up on easily. Finally, HPQ might be grossly undervalued. Currently, shares trade at 5.1-times trailing-12-month earnings, well below the industry median of 17.5 times.Conagra Brands (CAG)Conagra logo on a sign outside of a corporate campusSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAn American consumer packaged goods holding company, Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) represents one of the most pertinent dividend stocks with low payout ratios to consider. According to its public profile, Conagra makes and sells products under various brand names that are available in supermarkets, restaurants, and food service establishments.One of the more attractive features of CAG centers on its higher-ranking passive income profile. Per Dividend.com, Conagra carries a forward yield of 3.77%. This figure flies above the consumer staples average of only 1.89%. To be fair, the payout ratio is edging a bit on the higher side of things at 54%. However, with the company’s relatively predictable demand structure, this payout shouldn’t be a problem.Now, in full transparency, Conagra’s financials could use some improvement. However, it’s getting the job done. For instance, the company’s operating margin stands at 8.2%, ranking above 66% of the competition.Omnicom (OMC)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAn American global media, marketing, and corporate communications holding firm, Omnicom (NYSE:OMC) presents a higher-risk profile among dividend stocks with low payout ratios. Per its public profile, Omnicom provides services in four fields: advertising, customer relationship management, public relations, and specialty services. Again, with global slowdown fears materializing, OMC trades in an awkward juncture.Nevertheless, the stock performed remarkably well given the circumstances. Since the beginning of the year, OMC gained 3%. Aside from the capital gains potential, arguably most investors will tune into the passive income narrative. Here, the company features a forward yield of 3.68%, beating out the communications sector average of 2.62%. The payout ratio is reasonably low based on the high yield of 42.72%.That’s not all. Fundamentally, Omnicom enjoys strong profitability metrics. In particular, its operating margin of 14.45% ranks higher than over 80% of the industry. As a parting bonus, OMC trades at 12.2 times TTM earnings, which sits on the discounted side of the spectrum.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVPerhaps not the most exciting name among dividend stocks with low payout ratios, you’re going to have to extend me some rope with IBM (NYSE:IBM). Against absolute standards, it’s certainly not the lowest payout ratio you can find. However, Big Blue brings a combination of generous passive income and an underappreciated business.For instance, while most tech names incurred heavy losses in the market this year, IBM stock gained over 6%. To be sure, that beats out all three of the major equity indices. In addition, the legacy stalwart pivoted to many relevant businesses, including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and even the blockchain. Thus, you ignore IBM to your disadvantage.Per Dividend.com, Big Blue offers a healthy forward yield of 4.57%. Again, this ranks much higher than the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Now, where it gets a bit tricky is the payout ratio, which stands at nearly 69%. However, with 28 years of consecutive dividend increases, I believe IBM earns a second look.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

It's an alternative for sustainable options,"" Le Cunff said in an interview.""You can compost the paper capsules or recycle the aluminium ones.

Instead the new capsules were part of the brand's evolution and innovation.""People who have never considered Nespresso before will buy this capsule, and we may re onboard people who have left.""The brand had also been resilient during previous economic crises, so Le Cunff was confident about its future.""Nespresso is an affordable luxury you might want to protect as a consumer during a tough time,"" he added.

68,87c7c7ab-2eee-32af-a7c5-1b0075cb2ee4,LMT,2022-11-21,7 Top-Tier Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-top-tier-dividend-stocks-113033469.html,1668771033,STORY,"['LMT', 'AMGN', 'CMC', 'SBLK', 'ABR-PF', 'DVN', 'FANG']","[In a market like this, you always can find dividend stocks to buy. If you’re like most investors, you probably can’t wait for 2023. History books will show that 2022 was a huge disappointment for the stock market, although it did create some compelling opportunities for top-tier dividend stocks.First of all, dividend stocks are a huge benefit in any portfolio. Dividend stocks pay a quarterly or monthly payment to shareholders, who can use the money for income (a great idea for retirees). Or for younger investors, a regular dividend payment can be reinvested into the market to help grow your portfolio quicker.My Dividend Grader is a great tool to find these top-tier dividend stocks to buy. The Dividend Grader evaluates dividend stocks on a variety of metrics and assigns a letter grade – just like in school, the best dividend stocks get an “A” or “B” rating.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIt’s similar to my Portfolio Grader tool, which also grades stocks based on earnings, analyst sentiment, momentum and qualitative standards.You can find great dividend stocks to buy in a variety of sectors – this list includes defense, energy, biotech, materials and real estate. While the names and sectors vary, all of these stocks have one thing in common – they’re among the best dividend stocks you can buy heading into 2023.LMTLockheed Martin$472.77AMGNAmgen$287.30ABRArbor Realty Trust $14.01SBLKStar Bulk Carriers$19.90FANGDiamondback Energy$161.78CMCCommercial Metals$47.65DVNDevon Energy$70.99Lockheed Martin (LMT)A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comGeopolitical tensions aren’t great for a lot of reasons, but one way to capitalize is defense contractors like Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). Lockheed Martin is one of the biggest and most well-known contractors in the world and is always among the best dividend stocks to buy.While the stock market spent much of 2022 in correction territory, LMT is up more than 30% on the year as the U.S. keeps a wary eye on the war in Ukraine and tensions with China and North Korea.Story continuesNo doubt, Lockheed Martin makes money hand over fist. It brought in $16.58 billion just in the third quarter. While the company narrowly missed estimates of $16,68 billion, that appears to be a minor setback. Lockheed reaffirmed its outlook for the full year, for which it says it expects revenue of $65.25 billion and full-year earnings per share of $21.55.Lockheed provides a solid dividend yield of 2.6%, helping push it to an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader and a “B” rating in my Dividend Grader.Amgen (AMGN)the Amgen (AMGN) logo on a building during daylightSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAs a top biotech stock, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is on the cutting edge of providing treatments for a variety of ailments, including rheumatoid arthritis, bone cancer and psoriasis.While it’s not a household name, Amgen has succeeded in building an impressive pipeline of medications that keeps that revenue and earnings rolling in.Revenue in the third quarter was $6.65 billion, topping estimates by $100 million. Earnings per share were also solid at $4.70 per share, better than the $4.45 that the experts predicted.Meanwhile, the stock is up more than 18% so far this year with most of those gains coming since early September when Amgen impressed investors and analysts alike by unveiling updated long-term positive data about the effectiveness of Repatha drug that is used to treat high cholesterol.AMGN stock has a dividend yield of 2.7%. It has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader and a “B” rating in my Dividend Grader.Arbor Realty Trust (ABR)the Arbor Realty Trust (ABR) logo on a web browser, magnified by a magnifying glassSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for reliable income from a stock, it rarely hurts to consider the best real estate names in the market. One of the best right now is Arbor Realty Trust (NYSE:ABR), which is involved with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan programs, FHA and low-income loans, and bridge loans.Arbor is a real estate investment trust or REIT. REITs are special types of investments because they are required to distribute 90% of their taxable earnings to shareholders. That can create some pretty extraordinary payout ratios and ABR is no exception – currently, it pays a dividend yield of 10.8%.Admittedly, with high interest rates there’s always a risk that the housing market will be slow for a while. But ABR doesn’t seem to be affected by the problem. Arbor topped top- and bottom-line estimates for revenue and EPS in each of the first three quarters.Arbor Realty has a “B” rating in the Dividend Grader.Star Bulk Carriers (SBLK)Plenty of shipping containers stacked at the Port of Hamburg and blue skySource: Hieronymus Ukkel / Shutterstock.comStar Bulk Carriers (NASDAQ:SBLK) has a stock price just under $20, but it paid a mammoth dividend over the last year of $6.55.Its last three quarterly dividends came in at $1.25, $2 and $1.65. So, you’re looking at a dividend yield for SBLK of more than 30% right now.Star Bulk transports dry bulk goods around the world on its fleet of 128 vessels. As the world is still coming to grips with the effects of Covid-19 shutdowns on the supply chain, Star Bulk’s vessels appear to be in demand. That should keep the profits coming in for shareholders.SBLK stock has a “B” rating in my Portfolio Grader and an “A” rating in the Dividend Grader.Diamondback Energy (FANG)diamondback energy logo on its website to represent oil stocksSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comTexas-based Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) is an energy exploration company that is involved with petroleum, natural gas liquids and natural gas.Its holdings are in the Permian Basin in west Texas, where it also recently acquired the assets of Lario Permian, a subsidiary of Lario Oil &amp; Gas Co., in exchange for $850 million plus 4.18 million shares of FANG stock. The deal gives Diamondback access to another 25,000 acres in the Northern Midland Basin. The deal is expected to close in late January.That keeps Diamondback in growth mode. The company reported revenue in Q3 of $2.44 billion, which was more than 30% greater than a year ago. The revenue number also beat analysts’ expectations of $2.42 billion. EPS for the third quarter was also a pleasant surprise, coming in at $6.48 versus expectations of $6.36.FANG stock is up 48% so far this year and offers a dividend yield of 5.3%. Not surprisingly, it has “A” ratings in both the Dividend Grader and the Portfolio Grader.Commercial Metals (CMC)CMC Commercial Metals Company logo close-up on website page, Illustrative EditorialSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.comAs a major provider of recycled steel, Commercial Metals (NYSE:CMC) maintains operations in the United States and Poland.Its recycled metals are used in bridges, roads, automobiles, airports and other major buildings. The company is the largest manufacturer of steel reinforcing bar, known as rebar, in North America and central Europe.Earlier this month, CMC completed its acquisition of a Texas metal recycling facility and related assets from Kodiak Resources, adding another 55,000 tons of annual capacity to its portfolio.Earnings for the company’s fiscal fourth quarter beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines. CMC reported revenue of $2.41 billion and EPS of $2.45, versus estimates for $2.37 billion revenue and EPS of $2.23.Commercial Metals stock is up 30% so far this year and has a dividend yield of 1.4%. That gives it “A” grades in both the Dividend Grader and the Portfolio Grader.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comNo stock on this list has grown as much in 2022 as Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN). Fueled by higher oil and natural gas prices, Devon stock is up more than 60% on the year. And even if the globe sinks into a recession, Devon stock should be fine because analysts project crude oil prices to remain high for the next several years.On Nov. 1, Devon announced a dividend of $1.35 per share; a 61% increase from a year ago. That puts Devon’s dividend yield at a whopping 7.3%.The Oklahoma company should also benefit from the Biden administration’s deal with the European Union. Washington wants to reduce the EU’s reliance on Russian natural gas by providing at least 15 billion cubic meters of liquified natural gas in 2022.As long as Russia remains at odds with the west, companies like Devon stand to capitalize in European markets.DNV stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader and the Dividend Grader.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in LMT, AMGN, SBLK, CMC and DVN.

The benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index is down 17% year to date, while the tech-centric Nasdaq has plunged nearly 30% in the same period.If you don’t want to get caught up in the market’s wild swings, you might want to check out a few low-beta stocks (also known as low-volatility stocks).Beta is a measure of a stock’s volatility in comparison to the market as a whole. If a stock has a beta of greater than one, it’s more volatile than the broad market. Stocks with beta values of less than one are less sensitive to the market’s movements.Here’s a look at three low-beta stocks that could be worth considering.Don't missYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Mitt Romney says a billionaire tax will trigger demand for these two assets — get in now before the super-rich swarmWalmart (WMT)At a time when many brick-and-mortar retailers remain in the doldrums, powerhouse Walmart stands out.The company runs a massive retail business with approximately 10,500 stores under 46 banners in 24 countries. Thanks to its “Everyday Low Prices,” Walmart attracts around 230 million customers to its stores and websites every week.Walmart could be an opportunity for those looking for low volatility: the stock’s five-year beta is just 0.53 and is actually up 5.5% over the past year.And because of the company’s massive economies of scale, the business has remained resilient throughout several economic cycles.Consider this: Walmart paid its first-ever dividend in 1974. Since then, it has increased its payout every single year.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)With deeply entrenched positions in consumer health, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices markets, healthcare giant Johnson &amp; Johnson has delivered consistent returns to investors.Story continuesMany of the company’s consumer health brands — such as Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine — are household names. In total, JNJ has 29 products each capable of generating over $1 billion in annual sales.Over the past 20 years, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s adjusted earnings have increased at an average annual rate of 8%.Read more: Buy when there's blood in the streets: Here are the best investing apps to pounce on 'once-in-a-generation' opportunities (even if you're a beginner)JNJ announced its 60th consecutive annual dividend increase in April and now offers an annual dividend yield of 2.6%.The stock has a five-year beta of 0.57 and is up 8% over the past year.Coca-Cola (KO)Coca-Cola is a classic example of a recession-resistant business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable for most people.The company’s entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands — including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater — give it plenty of pricing power.Add solid geographic diversification — its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe — and it’s clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago.According to the latest earnings report, Coca-Cola’s net revenue grew 10% year over year, while its adjusted earnings per share improved by 7%.The stock has a five-year beta of 0.58 and has climbed by 11% in 2022.Still can't stand stocks?Of course, you don't have to limit yourself to stocks.Amid hot inflation and the uncertain economy, savvy investors have been diversifying their investments outside of the stock market.Prime commercial real estate, for example, has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over a 25-year period. With the help of new platforms, these kinds of opportunities are now available to retail investors. Not just the ultra rich.With a single investment, investors can own institutional-quality properties leased by brands like CVS, Kroger and Walmart — and collect stable grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

(""Imago"") (Nasdaq: IMGO) today announced that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement under which Merck, through a subsidiary, will acquire Imago for $36.00 per share in cash for an approximate total equity value of $1.35 billion.This press release features multimedia.

""This acquisition of Imago augments our pipeline and strengthens our presence in the growing field of hematology.""Imago is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing new medicines for the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and other bone marrow diseases. Imago’s lead candidate bomedemstat (IMG-7289), an investigational orally available lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitor, is currently being evaluated in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of essential thrombocythemia (ET), myelofibrosis (MF), and polycythemia vera (PV), in addition to other indications.""This milestone is a testament to more than a decade of pioneering research by Imago scientists and the entire Imago team’s unwavering dedication to improving the lives of patients,"" said Dr. Hugh Y.

Li, president, Merck Research Laboratories. ""We look forward to working with the Imago team to further investigate the potential of bomedemstat for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.""Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, Merck, through a subsidiary, will initiate a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Imago. The closing of the tender offer will be subject to certain conditions, including the tender of shares representing at least a majority of the total number of Imago’s outstanding shares, the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary conditions. Upon the successful completion of the tender offer, Merck’s acquisition subsidiary will be merged into Imago, and any remaining shares of common stock of Imago will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the same $36 per share price payable in the tender offer. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023.Myeloproliferative neoplasmsMyeloproliferative neoplasms are a group of diseases of the bone marrow characterized by excessive production of red blood cells, platelets, or certain white blood cells. Myeloproliferative neoplasms progress over time as the number of extra cells build up in the blood and/or bone marrow. This may lead to bleeding problems, anemia, infection, fatigue, thrombosis or other signs and symptoms. Certain myeloproliferative neoplasms may become acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Myeloproliferative neoplasms include chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera, primary myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, and chronic eosinophilic leukemia.About lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1)LSD1, also called KDM1A, discovered in 2004, is a member of a group of epigenetic proteins that regulate gene expression through chemical modifications of proteins, RNA and DNA. LSD1 regulates the maturation of bone marrow stem cells and is essential for the differentiation of progenitor cells into mature megakaryocytes and granulocytes and production of blood cells. Given the role that LSD1 plays in the function of malignant blood cells, targeting LSD1 for the treatment of blood cancers offers a new mechanism for the treatment of diseases associated with high morbidity and mortality.Important Information About the Tender OfferThe tender offer described in this press release has not yet commenced.

Negotiations have advanced very well,"" he said.In February, the U.S. State Department approved the potential sale of Boeing F-15ID aircraft and related equipment to Indonesia in a deal valued at up to $13.9 billion, the Pentagon said.Indonesia has been seeking to overhaul its ageing air fleet for some time, which currently includes U.S.-made F-16 and Russian Sukhoi Su-27 and Su-30 jets.""We certainly support the minister's efforts to continue to modernise their defence systems and capabilities and we want to continue to be helpful in any way we can,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Austin said.""The acquisition of the F15 certainly increases interoperability,"" he added.Addressing tensions between major powers in the Indo-Pacific region, Prabowo, an ex-special forces general, said Indonesia was committed to its policy of non-alignment and was ""honoured"" to maintain good relations with both China and the United States.Prabowo met with his Chinese counterpart Defence Minister Wei Fenghe in the city of Xi'an last Friday, where it was agreed that Indonesia and China would resume joint military training exercises and education, which had been paused during the COVID-19 pandemic.Earlier this year, Indonesia and the United States also participated in the Super Garuda Shield exercise, a military partnership between the countries that is now one of the biggest joint, multinational exercises in the region.Story continuesMonday's meeting between Austin and Prabowo comes as the U.S. works to strengthen its relations with countries in the region amid fears over Beijing's growing military presence, and possible conflict over Taiwan.U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris met Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos in Manila on Monday, part of a three-day trip that has been billed as a chance to reset security ties.After his Jakarta leg, Austin will travel to Cambodia to attend an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) defence ministerial meeting.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Boeing What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.60bUS$8.25bUS$9.24bUS$9.45bUS$9.65bUS$9.85bUS$10.0bUS$10.3bUS$10.5bUS$10.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x4Est @ 2.08%Est @ 2.05%Est @ 2.03%Est @ 2.01%Est @ 2%Est @ 2% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4% US$4.3kUS$7.2kUS$7.5kUS$7.1kUS$6.8kUS$6.4kUS$6.1kUS$5.8kUS$5.5kUS$5.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$62bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$11b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.4%– 2.0%) = US$202bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$202b÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$100bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$161b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$174, the company appears quite good value at a 36% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Boeing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.047. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Boeing, we've put together three fundamental items you should explore:Risks: For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Boeing  that you should be aware of.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for BA's future outlook?

But at least the stock is up over the last five years. However we are not very impressed because the share price is only up 28%, less than the market return of 61%.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Southern While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Southern achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 42% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 5% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Southern has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Southern's TSR for the last 5 years was 59%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Southern shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 8.8% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 10% a year, is even better. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Southern   (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

83,166770dc-fa7a-39c7-88ae-52fb43f91dbe,CI,2022-11-21,Cigna Corporation's (NYSE:CI) Stock Has Fared Decently: Is the Market Following Strong Financials?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-corporations-nyse-ci-stock-130043971.html,1669035643,STORY,['CI'],"[Most readers would already know that Cigna's (NYSE:CI) stock increased by 9.5% over the past three months. Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Cigna's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Cigna How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cigna is:15% = US$6.7b ÷ US$45b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.15 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Cigna's Earnings Growth And 15% ROEAt first glance, Cigna seems to have a decent ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 13% the company's ROE looks quite decent. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the impressive net income growth of 23% seen over the past five years by Cigna. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesWe then compared Cigna's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 16% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is CI fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Cigna Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Cigna's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 4.3% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (96%) of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Additionally, Cigna has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 19% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the higher expected payout ratio.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Cigna's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

85,2726467e-aae3-3125-b7c1-93fb55e12272,WFC,2022-11-21,Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 74% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-company-nyse-wfc-120218834.html,1669032138,STORY,['WFC-PD'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 74% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Wells Fargo, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wells Fargo?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Wells Fargo already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Wells Fargo, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Wells Fargo is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.6% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.9% and 4.2% of the stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Wells Fargo &amp; Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$134m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 26% stake in Wells Fargo. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

That is, there were more number of shares sold by insiders than there were purchased.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Wells Fargo The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Wells FargoOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Kleber Santos, for US$1.0m worth of shares, at about US$44.44 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$46.50). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was 51% of Kleber Santos's holding. Kleber Santos was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Wells Fargo insiders own about US$134m worth of shares (which is 0.08% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Wells Fargo Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Wells Fargo, we can't say the same about the selling of shares.

The companies said they had formed special committees to evaluate the proposal.""Fox Business may benefit from greater integration with the Wall Street Journal and some of Dow Jones' other properties, but it is highly debatable whether the benefits from such an association flow both ways,"" Irenic said in the letter.After years of expansion globally, Murdoch split his empire in 2013, placing the print business in newly created public entity News Corp and the TV and entertainment businesses under 21st Century Fox.Murdoch said at the time that his vast media holdings had become ""increasingly complex,"" and that a new structure would simplify operations.""The problem is they did not go far enough after they separated out News Corp in 2013,"" Huber added.(This story has been refiled to remove extraneous words from first paragraph and dateline)(Reporting by Eva Mathews and Chavi Mehta in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)]"

(NASDAQ:PYPL) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 42.1x P/E ratio. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.PayPal Holdings could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on PayPal Holdings.How Is PayPal Holdings' Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as PayPal Holdings' is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 53% decrease to the company's bottom line. The last three years don't look nice either as the company has shrunk EPS by 6.6% in aggregate. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 31% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 8.9% each year growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's understandable that PayPal Holdings' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Key TakeawayTypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of PayPal Holdings' analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Having said that, be aware  PayPal Holdings is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

94,25a4cae5-b46e-3243-ba7e-95fbc2696377,IBM,2022-11-21,7 Dividend Stocks With Low Payout Ratios and High Yields,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-stocks-low-payout-201945191.html,1668716385,STORY,"['TSN', 'HPQ', 'TGT', 'IBM', 'OMC', 'CAG', 'MTB-PH']","[With the market offering little clues as to its ultimate trajectory, investors may want to consider dividend stocks with low payout ratios. Passive income always represents an attractive attribute but that’s only half of the story. The other half centers on sustainability of said income, which is where the payout ratio comes into play.Essentially, this metric represents the proportion of earnings from which a company pays its shareholders in the form of dividends. While no absolute rules exist, generally speaking, the lower the range of the payout ratio, the higher probability that the underlying dividends are sustainable. Therefore, dividend stocks with low payout ratios – but still commanding relatively high yields – bring much to the table.Of course, you’re going to have to work with me on this list. Typically, the higher the reward, the greater the risk. Nevertheless, I’ve put together an eclectic mix of dividend stocks with low payout ratios that should help investors ride out the current storm.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTGTTarget$160.31MTBM&amp;T Bank$167.26TSNTyson Foods$65.03HPQHP Inc.$29.26CAGConagra$34.88OMCOmnicom$76.15IBMIBM.$145.77Target (TGT)Source: ShutterstockGoing speculative as the lead-off name for this list of dividend stocks with low payout ratios, Target (NYSE:TGT) immediately draws concerns. Fundamentally, the current pensive environment resulted in consumer sentiment slipping near historic lows. What’s more, Target recently warned of a weak holiday sales cycle, sending shares down 13% for the Nov. 16 session.If that wasn’t bad enough, management also mentioned that organized retail crime sparked $400 million in extra profit loss. Obviously, the big-box retailer isn’t having a great time. Nevertheless, adventurous investors may want to target TGT as one of the dividend stocks with low payout ratios to buy.For one thing, in the trailing month, the stock actually gained slightly over 4%. Therefore, it’s possible that the volatility represented a one-and-done move. More to the point, Target offers a forward yield of 2.78%, ranking above the consumer staples average yield of 1.89%. In addition, its payout ratio of 36.28% should be sustainable, irrespective of recent woes.Story continuesM&amp;T Bank (MTB)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Headquartered in Buffalo, New York, M&amp;T Bank (NYSE:MTB) is a regional financial institution. The firm features 780 branches in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Fundamentally, regional banks may be somewhat insulated than their larger multinational peers as they focus on local communities. That’s especially true with people concerned about a global slowdown.MTB also attracts attention because it’s one of the dividend stocks with low payout ratios. Per Dividend.com, M&amp;T Bank features a forward yield of 2.85%. To be completely transparent, this figure rates lower than the sector average yield of 3.18%. But hear me out. The payout ratio sits at 24.75%, reflecting a sustainable and dependable flow of passive income.As well, the company carries a cash-to-debt ratio of 6.32 times, ranking higher than 77.5% of the competition. Also, its equity-to-asset ratio stands at 0.13 times, beating out the industry median of 0.09 times.Tyson Foods (TSN)A package of Tyson Foods (TSN) chicken breasts.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comAlthough a relevant company because of its indelible products, Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) embodies another enterprise loaded with distractions. This time, it’s of management’s doing, with the company’s CFO arrested for a trespassing and intoxication incident. Still, if you can get over this blight, an argument exists for TSN as one of the dividend stocks with low payout ratios to considerPer Dividend.com, Tyson offers a forward yield of 2.98%. Conspicuously, this ranks higher than the sector average of 1.89%. In addition, the payout ratio sits at a pedestrian 26.87%. As well, Tyson enjoys 10 years of consecutive dividend increases. While it’s not a Target – which has 50 years – the food processor is on a roll. Certainly, management will not want to give it up, especially since it needs to shape up.Financially, investors can take confidence that Tyson enjoys solid profit margins. As well, its return on equity (ROE) stands at 22.3%, reflecting a high-quality business. Even with all these positive attributes, TSN trades for only 8.4-times forward earnings, which is blisteringly cheap.HP (HPQ)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comGiven the aforementioned troubles in the consumer economy, it’s not particularly surprising that HP (NYSE:HPQ) struggled this year. Since the January opener, shares gave up 23% of equity value. With the underlying business focusing on personal computers, printers, and 3D printing solutions, HP needs sentiment to pick up. Interestingly, though, shares gained 14% in the trailing month.If you happen to own the conviction that most of the bad news already baked itself into HPQ, then you may want to consider its proposition as one of the dividend stocks with low payout ratios. Per Dividend.com, the company carries a forward yield of 3.41%. That’s much higher than the technology sector average of 1.37%. Additionally, the payout ratio sits at 27.57%, a sustainable level.As well, investors should note that the company owns 12 years of consecutive dividend increases. Again, it’s not a track record that management will give up on easily. Finally, HPQ might be grossly undervalued. Currently, shares trade at 5.1-times trailing-12-month earnings, well below the industry median of 17.5 times.Conagra Brands (CAG)Conagra logo on a sign outside of a corporate campusSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAn American consumer packaged goods holding company, Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) represents one of the most pertinent dividend stocks with low payout ratios to consider. According to its public profile, Conagra makes and sells products under various brand names that are available in supermarkets, restaurants, and food service establishments.One of the more attractive features of CAG centers on its higher-ranking passive income profile. Per Dividend.com, Conagra carries a forward yield of 3.77%. This figure flies above the consumer staples average of only 1.89%. To be fair, the payout ratio is edging a bit on the higher side of things at 54%. However, with the company’s relatively predictable demand structure, this payout shouldn’t be a problem.Now, in full transparency, Conagra’s financials could use some improvement. However, it’s getting the job done. For instance, the company’s operating margin stands at 8.2%, ranking above 66% of the competition.Omnicom (OMC)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAn American global media, marketing, and corporate communications holding firm, Omnicom (NYSE:OMC) presents a higher-risk profile among dividend stocks with low payout ratios. Per its public profile, Omnicom provides services in four fields: advertising, customer relationship management, public relations, and specialty services. Again, with global slowdown fears materializing, OMC trades in an awkward juncture.Nevertheless, the stock performed remarkably well given the circumstances. Since the beginning of the year, OMC gained 3%. Aside from the capital gains potential, arguably most investors will tune into the passive income narrative. Here, the company features a forward yield of 3.68%, beating out the communications sector average of 2.62%. The payout ratio is reasonably low based on the high yield of 42.72%.That’s not all. Fundamentally, Omnicom enjoys strong profitability metrics. In particular, its operating margin of 14.45% ranks higher than over 80% of the industry. As a parting bonus, OMC trades at 12.2 times TTM earnings, which sits on the discounted side of the spectrum.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVPerhaps not the most exciting name among dividend stocks with low payout ratios, you’re going to have to extend me some rope with IBM (NYSE:IBM). Against absolute standards, it’s certainly not the lowest payout ratio you can find. However, Big Blue brings a combination of generous passive income and an underappreciated business.For instance, while most tech names incurred heavy losses in the market this year, IBM stock gained over 6%. To be sure, that beats out all three of the major equity indices. In addition, the legacy stalwart pivoted to many relevant businesses, including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and even the blockchain. Thus, you ignore IBM to your disadvantage.Per Dividend.com, Big Blue offers a healthy forward yield of 4.57%. Again, this ranks much higher than the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Now, where it gets a bit tricky is the payout ratio, which stands at nearly 69%. However, with 28 years of consecutive dividend increases, I believe IBM earns a second look.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

97,ad2e82fc-403f-3ca6-9e4d-f302baa242b4,MKC,2022-11-21,"With 84% institutional ownership, McCormick & Company, Incorporated (NYSE:MKC) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/84-institutional-ownership-mccormick-company-102733981.html,1669026453,STORY,"['MKC', 'MKC-V']","[To get a sense of who is truly in control of McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated (NYSE:MKC), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 84% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of McCormick, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for McCormick ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McCormick?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that McCormick does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of McCormick, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in McCormick. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.9% and 7.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 15 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of McCormickWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$77m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over McCormick. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with McCormick (including 1 which is a bit unpleasant) .But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Microchip Companies in the World.The microchip, or semiconductor industry consists of companies engaged in the production of semiconductors and related devices which can include integrated circuits and transistors. It is one of the more recent industries out there, having come into existence in 1960. By 2018, the industry was making close to half a trillion dollars in annual revenue, recording total sales of $556 billion in 2021. 2021 saw more than 1.1 trillion semiconductor chips being shipped, setting a new record for the total number of semiconductor chips being issued in a single year. It is also one of the most important industries as it provides products for the tech and electronics industry. The tech industry reached sales of over $5 trillion in 2018, while e-commerce exceeded $29 trillion in sales in 2017. In 2027, the semiconductor industry is expected to be worth more than $726 billion.The semiconductor industry is mainly used for computers and related equipment, which makes up 32.3% of the total market share of microprocessors. This is followed by consumer electronics which makes up nearly a fifth of the total market share. Telecommunications equipment, industrial electronics, defense and aerospace industry, and the transportation industry account for the remaining major market share of the microdevices industry.15 biggest microchip companies in the worldIaroslav Neliubov/Shutterstock.comChina is the one of the biggest producers and markets of semiconductors and includes a variety of companies such as integrated device manufacturers to fabless semiconductor companies to pure-play foundries. While China has many major companies in each type of industry, all of its companies fail to make the list of the biggest microdevice companies in the world. The Chinese semiconductor industry is about to experience further setbacks as in October 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced that there would be changes to export control policies towards China, with the major focus of this revision impacting the semiconductor industry and the artificial intelligence industry. The impact of this on the Chinese industry, while uncertain, will be significant, especially for the companies working on technology nodes that are less than a decade long.Story continuesMost of the biggest microchip companies in the world are in the United States, with 10 of the biggest 15 being located in the country, with the others being in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. In 2022, the semiconductor industry will be worth $600 billion though most of this will be concentrated among a few companies in just a handful of countries. The semiconductor industry has been affected by major supply chain shortages over the past two years, and even though semiconductor chips can often cost less than a dollar, a delay in their delivery can result in the delay of the assembly of a device worth tens of thousands of dollars. In fact, assessments are that the supply delays of microchips resulted in the loss of more than $500 billion either directly or indirectly, with lost auto sales being worth $210 billion in 2021 alone. While these shortages are expected to continue in the first half of 2023, the industry is still expected to grow by 10% while companies within the industry will continue to innovate and digitize. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the biggest companies in one of the most integral industries right now, starting with number 15:15. Analog Devices, Inc.

Following McInerney’s appointment, Kelly will assume the role of Executive Chairman of the Board.""Ryan's challenge as a CEO during this time is that we're in inflationary times,"" Darrin Peller, managing director at Wolfe Research, told Reuters, adding that the company ""will need to focus on growing profit and reducing expenses amid the uncertain economic environment,"" according to Reuters.Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) board member James Murdoch says CEO Elon Musk has ""in the last few months identified someone as a potential successor in the role of chief executive,"" Reuters has reported. The director did not provide any further details or hints as to who Tesla's next leader may be.Musk's tendency to spearhead multiple global businesses at once has seen increased scrutiny and criticism from investors and analysts in recent months, with some attributing Tesla's poor stock performance - shares are down 54% YTD, and 40% in past 2 months alone - to the loss of confidence in Musk's ability to maintain enough focus.

The development pipeline now spans 15 million square feet across high growth U.S. markets with tremendous value creation potentialSuccessfully completed and leased up projects with a total investment of $570 million3, and on track to complete and lease up another four projects at a total investment of $469 millionDelivered strong operating performance, including 17.5% YoY NOI growth and 96% occupancy as of Q3 2022Significantly fortified Aimco’s balance sheet by retiring or refinancing more than $1 billion of near-term liabilities and eliminating substantially all of the Company’s floating rate exposureUnlocked almost $1 billion of asset value including the monetization of $669 million of leasehold development assets4, the sale of three stabilized multifamily assets for $265 million at a premium to New Aimco’s internal NAV estimate and the sale of a partial interest in New Aimco’s minority investment in IQHQ, generating a greater than 50% IRREliminated various legacy entanglements with AIR 18 months sooner than anticipated through the early repayment of the $534 million purchase money note, the reduction of leasehold liabilities from $475 million down to $6 million and the amendment of key provisions of the master leasing agreement with AIREntered into a strategic capital partnership with Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation, providing core equity capital for up to $1 billion of Aimco-led multifamily development projects and creating the opportunity to earn third-party management fees and incentive incomeNew Aimco has delivered superior returns since its Board and management team have been in place, and the New Aimco Board is committed to realizing the Company’s full value potentialNew Aimco has delivered outstanding total stockholder returns of 45%5 since the 2020 spin-off of AIR, significantly outperforming Aimco’s custom developer proxy peer group6, the FTSE NAREIT Equity Apartments Index, the MSCI US REIT Index, the S&amp;P 500 Index and the Russell 2000 IndexNew Aimco trades approximately in line with or better than its peers on a premium / (discount) to NAV basis as of October 31, 2022; however, the Board and management team are not satisfied and are evaluating various options to accelerate value creationIn response to perspectives and feedback from stockholders, the New Aimco Board is evaluating a broad range of options to enhance stockholder value, including, but not limited to, structural alternatives for the Company, new capitalization and financing strategies for our development platform and pipeline, monetization of certain of the Company’s assets and accelerated share repurchasesNew Aimco has demonstrated a consistent focus on corporate governance and stockholder engagement under the reconstituted BoardThe Board includes fresh perspectives from seven new directors that are key contributors to the Company’s momentum and direction, balanced by the retention of three directors with complementary skillsets and important historical knowledge of Aimco’s business, structure and operationsGiven the success of Aimco’s strategic plan, the Board is accelerating the Company’s previously planned transition to annual elections for all directors for one-year terms beginning at the 2023 Annual MeetingThe Board will opt out of the provisions of the Maryland Unsolicited Takeover Act, or MUTA, that allow it to re-classify the Board without the approval of stockholdersThe Board intends to move the date of the Company’s Annual Meeting so the 2024 Annual Meeting will be held by the end of the second quarter of 2024New Aimco’s highly qualified director nominees are making specific contributions to New Aimco’s momentumJay Paul Leupp brings a stockholder’s perspective and deep experience managing investments in publicly traded REITs. He currently serves as Managing Partner / Senior Portfolio Manager, Real Estate Securities at Terra Firma Asset Management and previously served as Managing Director and Portfolio Manager, Global Real Estate Securities at Lazard Asset Management. He is committed to enhancing the Company’s investor relations programMichael A. Stein is a vital member of the New Aimco Board given his deep experience overseeing strategic corporate transactions that unlock stockholder value, as evidenced by his roles overseeing the separation of Marriott International &amp; Host Hotels and the sale of ICOS to Eli LillyR. Dary Stone brings significant expertise in several areas which are essential to Aimco’s new business plan, including real estate development and governance practices, given his experience and track record at Cousins Properties, Tolleson Wealth Management, Tolleson Private Bank, Baylor University and the Texas Banking CommissionLand &amp; Buildings has proposed two nominees whom the New Aimco Board unanimously determined would not be additiveAimco carefully evaluated Land &amp; Buildings’ candidates, including against the experience and qualifications of the Company’s directors who bring collective expertise across real estate and development either as operators, investors and/or board members. The Board determined that the election of either candidate put forth by Land &amp; Buildings would be dilutive to the quality of the New Aimco Board and remove expertise that is critical to our successMichelle Applebaum’s expertise pertains to the steel industry; she brings no relevant real estate or REIT experience. Three previous times she has been nominated by Land &amp; Buildings to stand for election to the boards of other public traded REITs, but she has not been elected or appointed in any instanceWhile we acknowledge James P. Sullivan has research experience from his role at Green Street Advisors, Aimco has worked closely with Mr. Sullivan’s former employer, Green Street Advisors since September 2021. Due to the Company’s close, ongoing advisory relationship with the unit within Green Street where Mr. Sullivan previously worked, Aimco already benefits from the full depth and breadth of that organization’s expertise. Mr. Sullivan also has never served on the board of a publicly traded company and has no public company experienceLand &amp; Buildings appears to have borrowed shares away from other Aimco stockholders, removing approximately 2.8% of the voteLand &amp; Buildings’ trading shows a material increase in beneficial ownership in the days before the record date followed by a significant decrease immediately following the record date:Land &amp; Buildings’ beneficial ownership in Aimco increased from 7.3 million shares as of the October 20, 2022, proxy statement to 12.5 million shares as of the October 26, 2022, record date7, and then quickly dropped back down to 8.8 million shares in the days immediately following the record dateThe 4.2 million shares borrowed by Land &amp; Buildings in advance of the record date removed approximately 2.8% of the vote from long term Aimco investorsSuch efforts to game the vote and disenfranchise other owners of Aimco stock are not consistent with Land &amp; Buildings’ claims that it is an advocate for all stockholdersPROTECT THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT AND AIMCO’S FUTURE GROWTH PROSPECTS.USE THE UNIVERSAL WHITE PROXY CARD TODAY TO VOTE FOR ALL THREEOF AIMCO’S QUALIFIED AND EXPERIENCED DIRECTORSIf you have questions or require any assistance with voting your shares,please contact the Company’s proxy solicitor listed below:MacKenziePartners, Inc.1407 Broadway, 27th FloorNew York, New York 10018Call Collect: (212) 929-5500orToll-Free (800) 322-2885Email: proxy@mackenziepartners.com_________________________1 Spin date as of December 14, 2020; TSR calculation as of October 31, 20222 Includes AHH, CLPR, CSR, ELME, FOR, FPH, HHC, IRT, JBGS, JOE, STRS, TRC, and VRE (per AIV 2021 10-K); represents simple average3 $469 million relief of leasehold obligation and $65 million direct capital4 Gross transaction price includes $469 million relief of leasehold obligation and $200 million net cash proceeds5 Spin date as of December 14, 2020; TSR calculation as of October 31, 20226 Includes AHH, CLPR, CSR, ELME, FOR, FPH, HHC, IRT, JBGS, JOE, STRS, TRC, and VRE (per AIV 2021 10-K); represents simple average7 Per nomination supplement provided to Aimco on November 1, 2022Glossary and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial and Operating MeasuresThis document includes certain financial and operating measures used by Aimco management that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP Aimco’s definitions and calculations of these Non-GAAP financial and operating measures and other terms may differ from the definitions and methodologies used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable. These Non-GAAP financial and operating measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance and should not be considered an alternative measure of liquidity.NET OPERATING INCOME (NOI) MARGIN: Represents an apartment community’s net operating income as a percentage of the apartment community’s rental and other property revenues.PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME (NOI): NOI is defined by Aimco as total property rental and other property revenues less direct property operating expenses, including real estate taxes NOI does not include property management revenues, primarily from affiliates casualties property management expenses depreciation or interest expense NOI is helpful because it helps both investors and management to understand the operating performance of real estate excluding costs associated with decisions about acquisition pricing, overhead allocations, and financing arrangements NOI is also considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of real estate Reconciliations of NOI as presented in this report to Aimco’s consolidated GAAP amounts are provided below.STABILIZED OPERATING PROPERTIES Apartment communities that (a.) are owned and asset managed by Aimco, Aimco,(b.) had reached a stabilized level of operations as of January 1 2021 and maintained it throughout the current and the comparable prior periods, and (c.) are not expected to be sold within 12 months.VALUE CREATION, NET OF COSTS: Value Creation, net of costs is defined by Aimco, in particular, as it relates to the termination of leases with AIR, as the lease termination payment less development and financing costs, net of operating revenues and expenses during the leasehold period.Due to the diversity of its economic ownership interests in its apartment communities in the periods presented, Aimco evaluates the performance of the apartment communities in its segments using Property NOI, which represents the NOI for the apartment communities that Aimco consolidates and excludes apartment communities that it does not consolidate. Property NOI is defined as rental and other property revenue less property operating expenses. In its evaluation of community results, Aimco excludes utility cost reimbursement from rental and other property revenues and reflects such amount as a reduction of the related utility expense within property operating expenses. The following table presents the reconciliation of GAAP rental and other property revenue to the revenues before utility reimbursements and GAAP property operating expenses to expenses, net of utility reimbursements as presented on Supplemental Schedule 6 of Aimco’s Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Release and Supplemental Schedules.Segment NOI ReconciliationThree Months Ended (in thousands)September 30, 2022September 30, 2021Total Real Estate OperationsRevenues,Before UtilityReimbursements [1]Expenses,Net of UtilityReimbursementsRevenues,Before UtilityReimbursements [1]Expenses,Net of UtilityReimbursementsTotal (per consolidated statements of operations)$47,683$17,455$42,893$18,155Adjustment: Utilities reimbursement(1,318)(1,318)(1,246)(1,246)Adjustment: Other Real Estate(4,263)1,286(3,472)1,136Adjustment: Non-stabilized and other amounts not allocated [2](7,428)(7,213)(7,066)(7,759)Total Stabilized Operating (per Schedule 6)$34,674$10,210$31,110$10,287[1] Approximately two-thirds of Aimco’s utility costs are reimbursed by residents. These reimbursements are included in rental and other property revenues on Aimco’s consolidated statements of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. This adjustment represents the reclassification of utility reimbursements from revenues to property operating expenses for the purpose of evaluating segment results and as presented on Supplemental Schedule 6. Aimco also excludes the reimbursement amounts from the calculation of Average Revenue per Apartment Home throughout this Earnings Release and Supplemental Schedules.[2] Properties not included in the Stabilized Operating Portfolio and other amounts not allocated includes operating results of properties not presented in the Stabilized Operation Portfolio as presented on Supplemental Schedule 6 during the periods shown, as well as property management and casualty expense, which are not included in property operating expenses, net of utility reimbursements in the Supplemental Schedule 6 presentation.About AimcoAimco is a diversified real estate company primarily focused on value add, opportunistic, and alternative investments, targeting the U.S. multifamily sector.

Iger replaces Bob Chapek, who was ousted after a series of missteps at the media conglom during his tenure.The “magic is back,” MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson wrote in a note Monday upgrading Disney’s stock from “market perform” to “outperform” and setting a $120/share 12-month price target.“We applaud Disney’s board for the courage to make this change,” Nathanson wrote. “We have never hidden our affection for Mr. Iger and the job that he did in building Disney into the global powerhousethat it has become.” The financial analyst noted that the firm has not recommended buying Disney shares since May 2020 “for multiple reasons, including concern that the former CEO Bob Chapek had become wedded to a streaming strategy that did not make sense given today’s reality.”Shares of Disney shot up as much as 10% in premarket trading Monday. It tailed off from earlier highs to close up 6.3% at $97.57/share, amid a decline in broader market indexes.Earlier this month, Disney’s stock price was battered after the media conglomerate missed Wall Street expectations for the September quarter and revealed that direct-to-streaming losses and linear TV cord-cutting declines for fiscal year 2023 would be higher than expected.On Nov. 7, Disney shares tumbled to their lowest level in more than two years, closing at $86.75/share. That was the lowest closing price for Disney shares since March 20, 2020, amid the dramatic market sell-off at the outset of the COVID pandemic. As of Friday, the stock had fallen 41% year to date.In bringing Iger back as CEO, the Disney board said it had given the exec a mandate “to set the strategic direction for renewed growth and to work closely with the board in developing a successor to lead the company at the completion of his term.”Story continues“I am extremely optimistic for the future of this great company and thrilled to be asked by the board to return as its CEO,” Iger said in a statement.As Disney’s CEO for 15 years, Iger led the acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox and increased the company’s market capitalization fivefold. Iger had headed Disney’s creative endeavors until his departure as executive chairman in December 2021, and “the company’s robust pipeline of content is a testament to his leadership and vision,” the board said.Iger is “perhaps the best leader in media,” Wells Fargo senior analyst Steven Cahall penned in a note Monday — and the Disney board has given him a green light “to shake things up.”“The Street will see him as a steady leader in uncertain times,” Cahall wrote in the note. “Equally important is that Iger is considered popular among the creative ranks within [Disney] and Hollywood — an area where Chapek was not embraced. Chapek was seen as an ace on park ops, whereas Iger is the content guru, and we think content is believed to be the lifeblood of the company.”Early in Iger’s run as chief exec, Disney’s film division had suffered large losses after “releasing expensive general entertainment that flopped,” which he turned around after acquiring Marvel, Lucasfilm and Pixar, Nathanson wrote in his note. “We would hope and expect that Mr. Iger examines the investment plans at Disney+ and refocuses their investment on areas of franchise strength and away from broader general entertainment content,” the analyst opined. In other words, Nathanson wrote, “Disney+ — and Disney’s shareholders — could probably do better with fewer end-state subscribers made up of superfans willing to pay high [revenue per subscriber], which would generate much higher margins.”In addition, given continuing sharp declines in the pay-TV ecosystem, Nathanson expects Iger to enact “deep cost-cutting at ESPN, which should include a review of all the upcoming sports rights in order to more adroitly adapt to these new times.”VIP+ Analysis: One Job, Two Bobs and the Disney MystiqueBest of VarietyWhat's Coming to Netflix in December 2022What's Coming to Disney+ in December 2022Matthew Perry Gets Real About His Addiction Journey In Vulnerable New Memoir 'Friends, Lovers and The Big Terrible Thing']"

126,25a4cae5-b46e-3243-ba7e-95fbc2696377,MTB,2022-11-21,7 Dividend Stocks With Low Payout Ratios and High Yields,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-stocks-low-payout-201945191.html,1668716385,STORY,"['TSN', 'HPQ', 'TGT', 'IBM', 'OMC', 'CAG', 'MTB-PH']","[With the market offering little clues as to its ultimate trajectory, investors may want to consider dividend stocks with low payout ratios. Passive income always represents an attractive attribute but that’s only half of the story. The other half centers on sustainability of said income, which is where the payout ratio comes into play.Essentially, this metric represents the proportion of earnings from which a company pays its shareholders in the form of dividends. While no absolute rules exist, generally speaking, the lower the range of the payout ratio, the higher probability that the underlying dividends are sustainable. Therefore, dividend stocks with low payout ratios – but still commanding relatively high yields – bring much to the table.Of course, you’re going to have to work with me on this list. Typically, the higher the reward, the greater the risk. Nevertheless, I’ve put together an eclectic mix of dividend stocks with low payout ratios that should help investors ride out the current storm.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTGTTarget$160.31MTBM&amp;T Bank$167.26TSNTyson Foods$65.03HPQHP Inc.$29.26CAGConagra$34.88OMCOmnicom$76.15IBMIBM.$145.77Target (TGT)Source: ShutterstockGoing speculative as the lead-off name for this list of dividend stocks with low payout ratios, Target (NYSE:TGT) immediately draws concerns. Fundamentally, the current pensive environment resulted in consumer sentiment slipping near historic lows. What’s more, Target recently warned of a weak holiday sales cycle, sending shares down 13% for the Nov. 16 session.If that wasn’t bad enough, management also mentioned that organized retail crime sparked $400 million in extra profit loss. Obviously, the big-box retailer isn’t having a great time. Nevertheless, adventurous investors may want to target TGT as one of the dividend stocks with low payout ratios to buy.For one thing, in the trailing month, the stock actually gained slightly over 4%. Therefore, it’s possible that the volatility represented a one-and-done move. More to the point, Target offers a forward yield of 2.78%, ranking above the consumer staples average yield of 1.89%. In addition, its payout ratio of 36.28% should be sustainable, irrespective of recent woes.Story continuesM&amp;T Bank (MTB)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Headquartered in Buffalo, New York, M&amp;T Bank (NYSE:MTB) is a regional financial institution. The firm features 780 branches in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. Fundamentally, regional banks may be somewhat insulated than their larger multinational peers as they focus on local communities. That’s especially true with people concerned about a global slowdown.MTB also attracts attention because it’s one of the dividend stocks with low payout ratios. Per Dividend.com, M&amp;T Bank features a forward yield of 2.85%. To be completely transparent, this figure rates lower than the sector average yield of 3.18%. But hear me out. The payout ratio sits at 24.75%, reflecting a sustainable and dependable flow of passive income.As well, the company carries a cash-to-debt ratio of 6.32 times, ranking higher than 77.5% of the competition. Also, its equity-to-asset ratio stands at 0.13 times, beating out the industry median of 0.09 times.Tyson Foods (TSN)A package of Tyson Foods (TSN) chicken breasts.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comAlthough a relevant company because of its indelible products, Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) embodies another enterprise loaded with distractions. This time, it’s of management’s doing, with the company’s CFO arrested for a trespassing and intoxication incident. Still, if you can get over this blight, an argument exists for TSN as one of the dividend stocks with low payout ratios to considerPer Dividend.com, Tyson offers a forward yield of 2.98%. Conspicuously, this ranks higher than the sector average of 1.89%. In addition, the payout ratio sits at a pedestrian 26.87%. As well, Tyson enjoys 10 years of consecutive dividend increases. While it’s not a Target – which has 50 years – the food processor is on a roll. Certainly, management will not want to give it up, especially since it needs to shape up.Financially, investors can take confidence that Tyson enjoys solid profit margins. As well, its return on equity (ROE) stands at 22.3%, reflecting a high-quality business. Even with all these positive attributes, TSN trades for only 8.4-times forward earnings, which is blisteringly cheap.HP (HPQ)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comGiven the aforementioned troubles in the consumer economy, it’s not particularly surprising that HP (NYSE:HPQ) struggled this year. Since the January opener, shares gave up 23% of equity value. With the underlying business focusing on personal computers, printers, and 3D printing solutions, HP needs sentiment to pick up. Interestingly, though, shares gained 14% in the trailing month.If you happen to own the conviction that most of the bad news already baked itself into HPQ, then you may want to consider its proposition as one of the dividend stocks with low payout ratios. Per Dividend.com, the company carries a forward yield of 3.41%. That’s much higher than the technology sector average of 1.37%. Additionally, the payout ratio sits at 27.57%, a sustainable level.As well, investors should note that the company owns 12 years of consecutive dividend increases. Again, it’s not a track record that management will give up on easily. Finally, HPQ might be grossly undervalued. Currently, shares trade at 5.1-times trailing-12-month earnings, well below the industry median of 17.5 times.Conagra Brands (CAG)Conagra logo on a sign outside of a corporate campusSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAn American consumer packaged goods holding company, Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) represents one of the most pertinent dividend stocks with low payout ratios to consider. According to its public profile, Conagra makes and sells products under various brand names that are available in supermarkets, restaurants, and food service establishments.One of the more attractive features of CAG centers on its higher-ranking passive income profile. Per Dividend.com, Conagra carries a forward yield of 3.77%. This figure flies above the consumer staples average of only 1.89%. To be fair, the payout ratio is edging a bit on the higher side of things at 54%. However, with the company’s relatively predictable demand structure, this payout shouldn’t be a problem.Now, in full transparency, Conagra’s financials could use some improvement. However, it’s getting the job done. For instance, the company’s operating margin stands at 8.2%, ranking above 66% of the competition.Omnicom (OMC)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAn American global media, marketing, and corporate communications holding firm, Omnicom (NYSE:OMC) presents a higher-risk profile among dividend stocks with low payout ratios. Per its public profile, Omnicom provides services in four fields: advertising, customer relationship management, public relations, and specialty services. Again, with global slowdown fears materializing, OMC trades in an awkward juncture.Nevertheless, the stock performed remarkably well given the circumstances. Since the beginning of the year, OMC gained 3%. Aside from the capital gains potential, arguably most investors will tune into the passive income narrative. Here, the company features a forward yield of 3.68%, beating out the communications sector average of 2.62%. The payout ratio is reasonably low based on the high yield of 42.72%.That’s not all. Fundamentally, Omnicom enjoys strong profitability metrics. In particular, its operating margin of 14.45% ranks higher than over 80% of the industry. As a parting bonus, OMC trades at 12.2 times TTM earnings, which sits on the discounted side of the spectrum.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVPerhaps not the most exciting name among dividend stocks with low payout ratios, you’re going to have to extend me some rope with IBM (NYSE:IBM). Against absolute standards, it’s certainly not the lowest payout ratio you can find. However, Big Blue brings a combination of generous passive income and an underappreciated business.For instance, while most tech names incurred heavy losses in the market this year, IBM stock gained over 6%. To be sure, that beats out all three of the major equity indices. In addition, the legacy stalwart pivoted to many relevant businesses, including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and even the blockchain. Thus, you ignore IBM to your disadvantage.Per Dividend.com, Big Blue offers a healthy forward yield of 4.57%. Again, this ranks much higher than the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Now, where it gets a bit tricky is the payout ratio, which stands at nearly 69%. However, with 28 years of consecutive dividend increases, I believe IBM earns a second look.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Oracle Is Oracle Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.9bUS$13.4bUS$16.1bUS$19.6bUS$21.0bUS$22.0bUS$22.8bUS$23.6bUS$24.3bUS$25.0bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x15Analyst x16Analyst x9Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.8%Est @ 3.95%Est @ 3.36%Est @ 2.95%Est @ 2.66% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$10.1kUS$11.4kUS$12.7kUS$14.3kUS$14.2kUS$13.7kUS$13.2kUS$12.6kUS$12.0kUS$11.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$126bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$25b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.0%) = US$411bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$411b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$188bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$313b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$79.7, the company appears quite undervalued at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Oracle as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.206. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Microchip Companies in the World.The microchip, or semiconductor industry consists of companies engaged in the production of semiconductors and related devices which can include integrated circuits and transistors. It is one of the more recent industries out there, having come into existence in 1960. By 2018, the industry was making close to half a trillion dollars in annual revenue, recording total sales of $556 billion in 2021. 2021 saw more than 1.1 trillion semiconductor chips being shipped, setting a new record for the total number of semiconductor chips being issued in a single year. It is also one of the most important industries as it provides products for the tech and electronics industry. The tech industry reached sales of over $5 trillion in 2018, while e-commerce exceeded $29 trillion in sales in 2017. In 2027, the semiconductor industry is expected to be worth more than $726 billion.The semiconductor industry is mainly used for computers and related equipment, which makes up 32.3% of the total market share of microprocessors. This is followed by consumer electronics which makes up nearly a fifth of the total market share. Telecommunications equipment, industrial electronics, defense and aerospace industry, and the transportation industry account for the remaining major market share of the microdevices industry.15 biggest microchip companies in the worldIaroslav Neliubov/Shutterstock.comChina is the one of the biggest producers and markets of semiconductors and includes a variety of companies such as integrated device manufacturers to fabless semiconductor companies to pure-play foundries. While China has many major companies in each type of industry, all of its companies fail to make the list of the biggest microdevice companies in the world. The Chinese semiconductor industry is about to experience further setbacks as in October 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced that there would be changes to export control policies towards China, with the major focus of this revision impacting the semiconductor industry and the artificial intelligence industry. The impact of this on the Chinese industry, while uncertain, will be significant, especially for the companies working on technology nodes that are less than a decade long.Story continuesMost of the biggest microchip companies in the world are in the United States, with 10 of the biggest 15 being located in the country, with the others being in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. In 2022, the semiconductor industry will be worth $600 billion though most of this will be concentrated among a few companies in just a handful of countries. The semiconductor industry has been affected by major supply chain shortages over the past two years, and even though semiconductor chips can often cost less than a dollar, a delay in their delivery can result in the delay of the assembly of a device worth tens of thousands of dollars. In fact, assessments are that the supply delays of microchips resulted in the loss of more than $500 billion either directly or indirectly, with lost auto sales being worth $210 billion in 2021 alone. While these shortages are expected to continue in the first half of 2023, the industry is still expected to grow by 10% while companies within the industry will continue to innovate and digitize.

136,3f199c24-9794-376f-bb61-2ad1dbb3eff9,MCD,2022-11-21,McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 69% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonalds-corporation-nyse-mcd-largely-140039419.html,1668952839,STORY,['MCD'],"[Every investor in McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 69% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of McDonald's, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for McDonald's ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McDonald's?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.McDonald's already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see McDonald's' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. McDonald's is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.2% of shares outstanding. With 6.8% and 4.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of McDonald'sThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that McDonald's Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$190m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 31% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over McDonald's. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand McDonald's better, we need to consider many other factors.

The company moved its headquarters from Chicago to Arlington, Virginia and made multiple financial settlements, including establishing a $500 million fund to compensate the families of those who died in the crashes, and paying nearly $2 billion in government fines and compensation to airlines whose aircraft orders were delayed.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, the company’s stock has not yet recovered from the ordeal. Over the past five years, BA stock has lost 34% of its value and now trades at $173 a share. Investors who’ve hung on waiting for the stock to recover have been disappointed.To be sure, the company remains one of only two, major aircraft manufacturers in the world along with Airbus SE (EPA:AIR) of France. And the company continues to get robust orders for its aircraft. But it seems that investors’ trust in Boeing has been irrevocably shaken.Story continuesDow Inc. (DOW)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comMichigan-based chemical company Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) was spun off by DowDuPont in 2019, which is when Dow Inc became a publicly traded company and its stock was promptly added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Since its IPO three years ago, DOW stock has only gained a slight 3%. At its current price of $49.60, the stock is trading only $1 above the $48.60 per share price at which it closed on its first trading day.Dow is extremely diversified, making products ranging from artificial turf and the stuff found in golf balls to adhesives, coatings, herbicides, insecticides, and chemicals used in automotive manufacturing. And the company is profitable and a market leader. It just reported a third-quarter profit of $739 million, or $1.02 per share, ahead of Wall Street analysts’ average forecasts.But it seems that DOW stock has had trouble capturing the interest of investors. As a result, the share price seems to be treading water, making it a Dow stock to sell right now.Dow Stocks to Sell Right Now: Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comRetail pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) has been a chronic underperformer. Over the past five years, the company’s stock is down 43%. WBA stock hit an all-time high of nearly $100 in 2015. Since then, it has been all down hill for the company and its shareholders. Today Walgreens’ stock trades at $40.The lack of progress by the shares appears to be the result of WBA’s low rate of diversification and its failed attempts at innovation. As if to compensate for years of underperformance, Walgreens has been in overdrive lately, announcing in 2021 that it would spend $5.2 billion to purchase the primary care company VillageMD, and announcing a plan to open 1,000 VillageMD primary care locations in its outlets by 2027. While the initiatives are aimed at reinvigorating Walgreens Boots Alliance and WBA stock, the aggressive moves seem to have had the opposite affect, spooking investors and analysts who are concerned about overspending and an overly aggressive expansion. One Dow Stock To Buy Right Now: McDonald’s (MCD)A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.comThe Golden Arches is a pretty safe bet. Even when the economy is in a slowdown or it’s shut down, as was the case during the pandemic, people still enjoy their McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) meals. That loyalty helps to power McDonald’s sales and stock through boom and bust cycles. This year, MCD stock is up 2%.While that might not sound impressive, it is when one considers that the S&amp;P 500 index is down 18% on the year. Over the past 12 months, McDonald’s stock has gained nearly 10% (again, that’s better than most stocks have done), and the share price is up 62% over five years.In addition to its loyal customers, McDonald’s also benefits from a culture of innovation and the fact that the company is constantly experimenting and changing its menu. Currently, McDonald’s is undertaking a farewell tour for the much beloved McRib sandwich, testing Krispy Kreme doughnuts at its locations, and has launched a line of Happy Meals targeted at adults.Plus, the company just reported an earnings print that beat Wall Street’s average expectations — again. Globally, the company’s same-store sales rose 10% year-over-year in Q3. That’s not bad, since we’re in the midst of a rapidly slowing global economy.The bottom line is that McDonald’s is a reliable blue-chip stock that provides consistent returns to shareholders in any type of market. Consequently, MCD stock is a buy.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) looks attractive right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for United Parcel Service, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.27 = US$14b ÷ (US$70b - US$18b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, United Parcel Service has an ROCE of 27%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Logistics industry average of 14%. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service roceIn the above chart we have measured United Parcel Service's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering United Parcel Service here  for free.What Can We Tell From United Parcel Service's ROCE Trend?We'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like United Parcel Service. The company has employed 77% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 27%. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.In Conclusion...In the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 84% return if they held over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.Story continuesSince virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for United Parcel Service   (of which 1 is a bit concerning!) that you should know about.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Martin Marietta Materials'  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Martin Marietta Materials How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Martin Marietta Materials is:12% = US$825m ÷ US$6.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.12 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Martin Marietta Materials' Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo start with, Martin Marietta Materials' ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 14%. This probably goes some way in explaining Martin Marietta Materials' moderate 6.0% growth over the past five years amongst other factors.Story continuesWe then compared Martin Marietta Materials' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 15% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MLM? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Martin Marietta Materials Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Martin Marietta Materials' three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 21% (implying that it retains 79% of its income), which is on the lower side, so it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business.Moreover, Martin Marietta Materials is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 17%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 12%.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Martin Marietta Materials' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

If you want to skip our introduction to the industry, then take a look at 5 Biggest Medical Device Companies in the World.The medical device market comprises companies that manufacture equipment used in diagnosing, treating and surveillance medical disorders. The market for medical devices is changing dramatically. The complicated patient demands and the COVID-19 pandemic encouraged businesses to innovate and produce new creative solutions, and the medical devices industry continued to see exceptional growth in 2020. The global market for medical equipment was worth roughly $456.8 billion in 2020, with a CAGR (Compound annual growth rate) of 3.5% from 2015. This market is expanding due to the rise in demand for high-tech medical items. There was a fall in the number of diagnoses for various diseases including cancer and TB among others as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic. However, as the pandemic wanes off, the medical device industry is continuing to get back on its growth trajectory.The frequency of chronic diseases will significantly affect the global medical device market beyond 2022. This encourages the employment of ever-improving technology tools for early disease detection and the creation of intelligent equipment like 3D printing, robots, and the internet of things. As a result, the market for medical device technology will expand at a CAGR of 4.9% from 2022 to 2027. Growth is predicted from $465.5 billion in 2022 to $591.3 billion in 2027.Some of the major players in the medical device industry are Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), and Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT).smart.art/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe list includes firms that manufacture medical equipment to treat illnesses.

(NYSE:GMED) in its Q4 2020 investor letter:“Healthcare continued its streak of underperformance in the fourth quarter. The biotech industry component of the Russell 2000 was up 34% for the quarter and 53% for the year. While we have become more open to investing in this space where appropriate, we prefer molecular diagnostics given less regulatory risk and better revenue diversification. With the new administration comes a shift in healthcare philosophy. We believe that further access to care and coverage expansion will benefit some parts of the sector. However, the risk of further reimbursement cuts, particularly in pharmaceuticals, will bear monitoring.…."" (Click here to read the full text)14. Penumbra, Inc.

Strong contributors during the fourth quarter included Penumbra, a developer of stents and related products to treat aneurysms that saw it shares recover from a product recall earlier in the year.”13. ShockWave Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWAV)Market Cap as of November 18: $8.96 B Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34ShockWave Medical, Inc.

(NASDAQ:SWAV) is an early stage medical device company developing and commercializing products to treat calcified cardiovascular disease. The company’s recent quarter of +116% YoY revenue growth was well ahead of expectations. The beat was driven primarily by the C2 coronary intravascular lithotripsy catheter—used to break up hard materials that restrict blood flow to the heart—as it makes solid progress capturing share from stenting cases. We believe the profit cycle opportunity for C2 is meaningful given its large addressable market ($4 billion).”12. Bruker Corporation (NASDAQ:BRKR)Market Cap as of November 18: $9.74 B Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Bruker Corporation (NASDAQ:BRKR) manufactures scientific equipment and diagnostic tests for the life sciences, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology sectors.

Smith &amp; Nephew is a Londonbased medical device company that specializes in knee and hip replacements, sports medicine, and wound management. We purchased the ADR, which has declined meaningfully (-31% year-to-date) along with the British pound. While Smith &amp; Nephew’s stock is priced in pounds, its revenues are in other major currencies, such as the dollar, euro, and yen. In 2021, 51% of its revenues were generated in the United States, while 31% were in other developed markets. We believe Smith &amp; Nephew is a high-quality business that generates above average profit margins and abundant free cash flow. We were pleased the turmoil in the British pound provided us with the opportunity to purchase its shares at a discount to our calculated valuation.”10. Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

Management cited a host of challenges, including COVID19 impacts, especially in China with restrictions and lockdowns under their zero-COVID policy, a weaker economic environment, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and the war in Ukraine, to name a few. Tough comparisons were also a reality— Invisalign case starts in 1Q22 were roughly flat, having lapped the 66% growth from the prior year. It’s not completely surprising that growth is slowing on such tough comparisons, but the company’s shares declined on the news..…."" (Click here to read the full text)8. Abiomed, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD)Market Cap as of November 18: $16.99 B Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34Abiomed, Inc.

Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD)Market Cap as of November 18: $20.66 B Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) manufactures insulin delivery devices for people with diabetes. It provides a wireless companion, portable personal diabetes management, and the Omnipod System. This self-adhesive disposable tubeless Omnipod gadget is worn on the body and is sustainable for up to three days at a time.Following Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD)'s Q3 earnings beat and revised FY22 projection, BTIG analyst Marie Thibault increased his price objective on the stock to $320 from $285 on November 11 and retained a ‘Buy’ rating.

We first purchased Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD), a leading provider of insulin pumps for diabetes patients, in the fourth quarter of 2021, and we have aggressively added to the position since then. The company is currently the only meaningful manufacturer of patch pumps, the preferred form factor for many patients as compared to traditional tubed pumps. We believe Insulet has a long runway for growth given its large and underpenetrated market, which is only one-third penetrated in Type 1 diabetes and low-single-digit penetrated in the insulin- intensive Type 2 diabetes population. Additionally, we see the launch of the company’s next generation offering, Omnipod 5, which received FDA clearance in January, as an accelerant to growth. Insulet has strong gross margins and is profitable today, though we still see room for significant operating margin expansion ahead.”6. Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH)Market Cap as of November 18: $23.53 B Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH) develops, produces, and sells orthopedic reconstructive implants, orthopedic supplies and surgical equipment. The majority of the reconstructive market in the US, Europe, and Japan is presently owned by Zimmer as a result of the acquisitions of Centerpulse in 2003 and Biomet in 2015.On November 3, Citi analyst Joanne Wuensch retained a ‘Neutral’ rating on the shares of Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.

(NYSE:ZBH), compared to 41 funds in the previous quarter. Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX), Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) and Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) are met by Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH) in our list of biggest medical devices stocks.In its Q4 2021 investor letter, Ariel Investments mentioned Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH). Here is what the fund said:“A reopening of the global economy with a reduction in the severity of the pandemic has led us to invest in companies that would perform well with an end to Covid restrictions such as canceled sports and entertainment events or companies that would benefit from pent-up demand for consumer products. Healthcare holdings such as Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. (ZBH) saw demand for their “elective” healthcare services decline sharply as hospitals lost capacity for non-essential surgeries or orthotics. We believed those companies should see a rebound in their business as cases decline. Unfortunately, two new Covid variants turned this theme from a tailwind to a headwind in the second half of the year. First, Delta then Omicron sent Covid cases higher and both companies saw their businesses slow again. Zimmer’s stock lost -13.04% in the fourth quarter. As we write, we believe Omicron cases could be nearing a peak which would allow our thesis to better play out this year.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest Medical Device Companies in the World. Suggested articles:12 Most Active Stocks To BuyTop 10 Clothing Companies in the WorldBiggest Beauty Companies in the WorldDisclosure: None. 15 Biggest Medical Device Companies in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
147,a2b64574-54b1-30ad-a54d-6304604dbeaa,OXY,2022-11-21,Occidental Petroleum Corporation's (NYSE:OXY) institutional investors lost 4.1% last week but have benefitted from longer-term gains,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-corporations-nyse-oxy-130054284.html,1669035654,STORY,['OXY'],"[If you want to know who really controls Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 58% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$2.8b last week. However, the 146% one-year return to shareholders may have helped lessen their pain. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Occidental Petroleum. View our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Occidental Petroleum?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Occidental Petroleum. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Occidental Petroleum, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Occidental Petroleum. The company's largest shareholder is Berkshire Hathaway Inc., with ownership of 21%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 10% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.8% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesWe did some more digging and found that 6 of the top shareholders account for roughly 53% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Occidental PetroleumThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Occidental Petroleum Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$136m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 20% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 21% of the Occidental Petroleum shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum (1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Ultimately the future is most important.

That’s because depressed stock valuations offer investors better entry points and, thus, the chance for higher potential gains when stocks eventually rebound.Of course, after the beating investors have taken in 2022, it’s only natural they would be more risk-averse than usual. As one trader put it, “The stock market is the only market where things go on sale and all the customers run out of the store.”For traders who are looking to put some capital to work in potential multibagger high-growth stocks, start with the three companies below. Each generates solid cash flow, sports a strong balance sheet, and has tailwinds that should carry its shares higher over the near, medium and long term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOXYOccidental Petroleum$71.46THTarget Hospitality$12.87MROMarathon Oil$31.30Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comFirst on my list of multibagger high-growth stocks to buy is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). I’ve been bullish on the oil and gas producer for quite some time, and for good reason. This company is essentially a cash flow machine, producing record profits as energy prices soared. It’s also one of the best value stocks on the market, trading at just 7.3 times earnings despite the 144% advance in shares this year.OXY has attracted the attention of Warren Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha has been buying shares hand over fist. At last count, he owned a nearly 21% stake in the company. And if that’s not enough to convince you to buy shares, Occidental’s financials should do the trick.The company reported four consecutive quarters of record earnings through Q2 2022. For the third quarter, the company reported $2.5 billion in profits, nearly 300% higher compared with the same quarter last year. Q3 revenue was up nearly 40% to $19.5 billion. These are the kind of numbers you might expect from a tech company.Story continuesFor the full year, analysts expect Occidental will pump out $9.94 per share in earnings. That would represent an increase of 290% over 2021. And they forecast revenue will jump 43% to $37.6 billion.For investors looking for multibagger high-growth stocks, Occidental is a no-brainer.Target Hospitality (TH)AHT stock: the front of a hotel with ornate columnsSource: ShutterstockTarget Hospitality (NASDAQ:TH) offers investors exposure to a unique business model in the rental real estate market. The company owns, constructs and operates a wide range of rental accommodations, including hotels and temporary housing units, primarily serving the energy and government sectors. It also provides hospitality services, such as culinary, concierge, laundry and security services, in addition to recreational facilities.TH stock is up more than 260% so far this year. Much of this can be attributed to the massive run-up in shares in early July. This followed news that the company expanded its lease and services agreement with the U.S. government to provide support for around 6,400 displaced people, about 60% more than the original contract. More recently, the company secured an exclusive 11-year partnership with a national nonprofit to continue providing critical humanitarian services for the Expanded Humanitarian Community.For the third quarter, Target Hospitality saw revenue surge 79% year over year to a record $159.6 million. Net income was up 184% from a year ago to $19 million. For the full year, analysts forecast revenue growth of nearly 71% to $497.8 billion. And they’re calling for EPS to swing from a 5-cent loss in 2021 to 93 cents in 2022 and $1.80 in 2023. At present, shares sit nearly 18% below their 52-week high, providing a great buying opportunity. TH stock isn’t recession-proof, but I think it will provide mutlibagger returns for investors over the long term.Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil Logo at the top of a mobile device.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comIt’s no mistake that Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) is the second major oil producer on this list of multibagger high-growth stocks. Shares are up more than 90% this year thanks in large part to the company’s massive profit growth.Yet, even with this big run-up, I’m not sure energy names like Occidental and Marathon get enough love as growth plays. Perhaps that’s because their low valuations are so low.

150,210a8f0a-b7f4-3226-9683-35ccc4fba205,OXY,2022-11-21,7 Warren Buffett Stocks With Room to Run in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-warren-buffett-stocks-room-150152436.html,1668697312,STORY,"['BRK-A', 'CVX', 'AAPL', 'BRK-B', 'ATVI', 'OXY', 'ALLY', 'HPQ', 'KO', 'MSFT']","[When Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) posted operating earnings growth of 20%, this reaffirmed how well Warren Buffett and its team manage the conglomerate. The company benefited from impressive net income from its insurance investment, as sell as surging profits from its utility and energy holdings. With these strong operating earnings, Berkshire has been able to improve shareholder returns by buying back over $1 billion of its common stock. For investors looking to create a wealth-creation machine, it’s important to assess the Warren Buffett stocks that have driven such impressive performance over the long-term.Berkshire continues to amass a large cash balance. Currently, the company holds around $109 billion in cash and short-term securities. This provides the potential for more Warren Buffett stocks to be added to the mix in upcoming quarters.Indeed, there may be some rotation yet to come. The conglomerate’s earnings from its railroad sector weakened in the quarter. Lower freight volumes and higher fuel and other operating costs weighed on results.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThus, investors might want to pick a subset of this long list of Warren Buffett stocks. With this strategy, investors may avoid exposure to areas one is uncomfortable with (such as railroads or insurance), and gain more exposure to other areas of the portfolio. It’s really personal preference.With that said, these seven Warren Buffett stocks I think are worth buying as we head into 2023.Buffett stocksBuffet’s holdings have strong growth and quality scoresChart courtesy of StockRoverThe companies listed above have strong brand names and are especially compelling. Inflation will increase their input costs. However, these Warren Buffett stocks have the ability to pass on higher costs to their customers, sustaining profit margins.AAPLApple$148.79ALLYAlly Financial$27.05ATVIActivision Blizzard$74.35CVXChevron$184.99HPQHP Inc.$29.29KOCoca-Cola$60.52OXYOccidental Petroleum$71.93Apple (AAPL)Earnings reports: A close-up shot of different Apple (AAPL) iPhones in front of a purple background.Source: Hadrian / Shutterstock.comStory continuesRecently, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched a new generation of iPhone 14 devices. This is one segment Mose investors in AAPL stock are watching closely. That’s because iPhone sales tend to be the revenue and profit growth driver for the company, as customer demand increases. Accordingly, this company’s results provided enthusiasm among investors. In the fourth quarter, iPhone sales grew by 10% to $42.6 billion, despite tougher year-on-year comparisons.Warren Buffett has been clear that his investment in Apple is for the long term. Thus, as we head into 2023, I think Buffett will be keeping an eye on how growth strengthens as a result of strong customer demand for the more expensive 14 Pro and Pro Max. Indeed, had the company not faced supply constraints for those models, Apple would have posted better results.Additionally, Apple’s services have high margins, which is a key selling point for investors. In the last few years, the company grew its Music, TV+ , and News+ businesses. Furthermore, Apple added Apple Arcade and Apple Fitness+ to its portfolio of services. Now, the company is offering the One bundle. By offering various price tiers, customers will be able to sign up for the service that suits their needs best.The company is in the early phases of expanding Apple TV+, introducing original content first and adding only four to five shows per title. Now that it has more viewers, Apple will increase the content and increase prices. Accordingly, I expect this move to lift revenue for Apple heading into the New Year.Ally Financial (ALLY)ally financial office building stocks to buySource: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comBerkshire recently boosted its position in Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY). Accordingly, readers may be speculating that Buffett is betting that charge-offs will start leveling off after the third quarter.In Q3, Ally’s Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Brown, thinks its charge-off levels will stabilize by mid-2023. This depends on how far the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Those levels depend on where inflation comes in at next year.Ally Financial services the automotive loan market. Accordingly, higher interest rates add lifetime losses to its books. Investors might assume that funding costs will not exceed 4%. However, if these costs do rise to this level, Ally will still get a return on equity of nearly 21%, with a return on assets of 2%.Ally is growing its loan book, deploying $12 billion worth of capital for new loans. For next year, the company is targeting annual loan volumes of $48 billion. Should risk levels rise, these loan numbers may get trimmed. That said, I still think this is a stock Buffett is in for a reason, and I like the valuation.Activision Blizzard (ATVI)Quarantine May Not Move Activision Blizzard Stock the Way You'd ExpectSource: Lauren Elisabeth / Shutterstock.comActivision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) is a video game developer that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to buy for $95 a share. The stock is currently trading at a discounted price relative to its buyout offer because markets are skeptical that the deal will go through.The European Union is opening an in-depth investigation into Microsoft’s $69 billion bid for Activision. In a statement, the EU said that as a result of the deal, competition would worsen in several markets. It is concerned that the console and PC gaming market will have less competition. Furthermore, Activision would have less competitive pressure in the subscription and cloud game streaming services segments.Microsoft could offer concessions to the EU, and is actively engaging with regulators. It appears Warren Buffett likely believes the deal will close in 2023. He need only hold ATVI stock and wait for the buyout to close.If regulators reject the buyout, Activision gets a breakup fee worth $2 billion. The fund infusion would greatly benefit Activision’s balance sheet, allowing for a payout of a special dividend to shareholders. Alternatively, the company could buy back stock. Either way, Activision shareholders will benefit.Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) is among the energy companies Berkshire holds to hedge against oil and gas inflation. Chevron is a company with ambitious plans to deploy its capital, something Warren Buffett likes. As the pandemic is in the rear-view mirror, Chevron hinted at providing an update to investors with its updated business plan and capital budget in December.Markets are not worried that cost inflation might erode the company’s profitability. CFO Pierre Breber expects costs to rise by 20% next year compared to this year. Fortunately, the company is operating well below its capital budget. That gives Chevron the flexibility to increase its investments over time, with growth in production likely.Refining activity is in severely short supply. Accordingly, Buffett probably expects refining margins to remain high, given the fact that many companies in this space shut down refineries and are unlikely to bring them back online. As one of the key players in planning new refinery developments, Chevron appears to be a politically-savvy way to play this space. Additionally, by easing global energy constraints, the company could increase its revenue potential thanks to strong energy demand.HP Inc. (HPQ)HP sign with blue sky and autumn leaves as backdropSource: ShutterstockHP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) is a personal computer supplier. Despite headwinds from low demand, HP’s computer and printer sales could eventually recover.Commercial sales of HP products are still strong. However, commercial customers may slow their orders as their concerns about a slowdown increase. As budgets are adjusted, HP will have a better idea of the market conditions for 2023 soon. That said, even if demand stalls, I think this will only push forward demand for HP’s products. That’s because customers still need to upgrade hardware every few years.Next year, the addressable market for PCs is expected to be around $300 million. It will grow, due primarily to the effects of the pandemic. After lockdowns ended, corporations faced calls to support a hybrid work environment. I think this secular trend will continue, meaning increased unit demand for PCs at home and work. For example, remote schooling and telemedicine are segments of the economy which will have a higher demand for personal computers.Corporations will seek higher productivity to offset inflationary pressures and the economic slowdown. This could push average selling prices higher as customers buy more powerful systems to achieve greater staff productivity.Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is a company that’s always found a way to navigate global challenges. Despite the conflict in Ukraine, pandemic lockdowns in China, and inflation everywhere, this company still posted strong revenue growth.Coca-Cola posted impressive revenue growth of 11.0% year-over-year. It expects organic revenue growth of 14% to 15% in 2023. Thus, its expected earnings per share growth of 15% to 16% will follow. For 2023, the company has forecasted top-line growth that also justifies owning this stock.Consumers are changing their behavior. Although many are loyal to buying Coca-Cola products, they may still spend less. Fortunately, the company has a dynamic basket of products which could see its overall demand for beverages, including water and juices, rise. That would offset a decline in sales of private label products.Additionally, Coca-Cola may offer price pack promotions that increase product affordability. Demand could rise without hurting the company’s profit margins. Thus, I think investors should expect strong business momentum this year to stretch into 2023.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) has been one of the best-performing Warren Buffett stocks this year. That’s a key reason why Berkshire accumulated a bigger position in OXY stock over the year. Aside from being a major energy producer, Occidental also has been investing heavily in carbon capture technology among its facilities, including those in the Permian.In 2023, Occidental is expected to sustain its capital spending levels. When energy prices rise, the company’s EBITDA remains strong. Thus, I think the revenue potential from upcoming projects next year should more than offset inflationary headwinds.Investors continue to see shareholder value growth thanks to the company’s continued dividend increases. In the near term, I don’t think Occidental’s dividend will increase alongside its cash flow. Instead, the company will use the cash to buy back shares, potentially nibbling at higher dividends over time.Currently, Occidental trades at steeply undervalued levels. Warren Buffett sees this, and appears keen on buying this company linked to energy prices. Given Occidental’s impressive cash flows, this is a company worth considering as a long-term investment.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Instead the new capsules were part of the brand's evolution and innovation.""People who have never considered Nespresso before will buy this capsule, and we may re onboard people who have left.""The brand had also been resilient during previous economic crises, so Le Cunff was confident about its future.""Nespresso is an affordable luxury you might want to protect as a consumer during a tough time,"" he added.

The benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index is down 17% year to date, while the tech-centric Nasdaq has plunged nearly 30% in the same period.If you don’t want to get caught up in the market’s wild swings, you might want to check out a few low-beta stocks (also known as low-volatility stocks).Beta is a measure of a stock’s volatility in comparison to the market as a whole. If a stock has a beta of greater than one, it’s more volatile than the broad market. Stocks with beta values of less than one are less sensitive to the market’s movements.Here’s a look at three low-beta stocks that could be worth considering.Don't missYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Mitt Romney says a billionaire tax will trigger demand for these two assets — get in now before the super-rich swarmWalmart (WMT)At a time when many brick-and-mortar retailers remain in the doldrums, powerhouse Walmart stands out.The company runs a massive retail business with approximately 10,500 stores under 46 banners in 24 countries. Thanks to its “Everyday Low Prices,” Walmart attracts around 230 million customers to its stores and websites every week.Walmart could be an opportunity for those looking for low volatility: the stock’s five-year beta is just 0.53 and is actually up 5.5% over the past year.And because of the company’s massive economies of scale, the business has remained resilient throughout several economic cycles.Consider this: Walmart paid its first-ever dividend in 1974. Since then, it has increased its payout every single year.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)With deeply entrenched positions in consumer health, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices markets, healthcare giant Johnson &amp; Johnson has delivered consistent returns to investors.Story continuesMany of the company’s consumer health brands — such as Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine — are household names. In total, JNJ has 29 products each capable of generating over $1 billion in annual sales.Over the past 20 years, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s adjusted earnings have increased at an average annual rate of 8%.Read more: Buy when there's blood in the streets: Here are the best investing apps to pounce on 'once-in-a-generation' opportunities (even if you're a beginner)JNJ announced its 60th consecutive annual dividend increase in April and now offers an annual dividend yield of 2.6%.The stock has a five-year beta of 0.57 and is up 8% over the past year.Coca-Cola (KO)Coca-Cola is a classic example of a recession-resistant business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable for most people.The company’s entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands — including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater — give it plenty of pricing power.Add solid geographic diversification — its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe — and it’s clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago.According to the latest earnings report, Coca-Cola’s net revenue grew 10% year over year, while its adjusted earnings per share improved by 7%.The stock has a five-year beta of 0.58 and has climbed by 11% in 2022.Still can't stand stocks?Of course, you don't have to limit yourself to stocks.Amid hot inflation and the uncertain economy, savvy investors have been diversifying their investments outside of the stock market.Prime commercial real estate, for example, has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over a 25-year period. With the help of new platforms, these kinds of opportunities are now available to retail investors. Not just the ultra rich.With a single investment, investors can own institutional-quality properties leased by brands like CVS, Kroger and Walmart — and collect stable grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

(NYSE:WM) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Waste Management Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.95bUS$2.69bUS$2.90bUS$3.13bUS$3.31bUS$3.45bUS$3.58bUS$3.70bUS$3.80bUS$3.90bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x10Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 5.58%Est @ 4.5%Est @ 3.74%Est @ 3.21%Est @ 2.84%Est @ 2.58% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0% US$1.8kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$22bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.0%– 2.0%) = US$80bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$80b÷ ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$41bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$63b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$161, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Waste Management as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.974. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

(NYSE:LYB) For Its Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-interested-lyondellbasell-industries-101602104.html,1669025762,STORY,['LYB'],"[LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (NYSE:LYB) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 3 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. In other words, investors can purchase LyondellBasell Industries' shares before the 25th of November in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 5th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.19 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$4.76 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that LyondellBasell Industries has a trailing yield of 5.8% on the current share price of $82.3. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether LyondellBasell Industries can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see LyondellBasell Industries paying out a modest 36% of its earnings. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether LyondellBasell Industries generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It distributed 28% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's positive to see that LyondellBasell Industries's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at LyondellBasell Industries, with earnings per share up 7.3% on average over the last five years. The company is retaining more than half of its earnings within the business, and it has been growing earnings at a decent rate. We think this is generally an attractive combination, as dividends can grow through a combination of earnings growth and or a higher payout ratio over time.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. LyondellBasell Industries has delivered an average of 17% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.The Bottom LineIs LyondellBasell Industries worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share growth has been growing somewhat, and LyondellBasell Industries is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends. This is interesting for a few reasons, as it suggests management may be reinvesting heavily in the business, but it also provides room to increase the dividend in time. It might be nice to see earnings growing faster, but LyondellBasell Industries is being conservative with its dividend payouts and could still perform reasonably over the long run. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.In light of that, while LyondellBasell Industries has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for LyondellBasell Industries (of which 1 can't be ignored!) you should know about.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. One great example is UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) which saw its share price drive 149% higher over five years. Meanwhile the share price is 1.5% higher than it was a week ago.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, UnitedHealth Group managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 20% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on UnitedHealth Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, UnitedHealth Group's TSR for the last 5 years was 168%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that UnitedHealth Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 22% over one year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 22% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group   you should know about.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

(NASDAQ:ADP) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.39bUS$4.83bUS$5.15bUS$5.08bUS$5.37bUS$5.52bUS$5.65bUS$5.79bUS$5.92bUS$6.04bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 2.73%Est @ 2.5%Est @ 2.35%Est @ 2.24%Est @ 2.16% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$4.1kUS$4.2kUS$4.2kUS$3.8kUS$3.8kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.3kUS$3.2kUS$3.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$37bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.0%) = US$118bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$118b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$59bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$95b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$256, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Automatic Data Processing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.019. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Procter &amp; Gamble's (NYSE:PG) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Procter &amp; Gamble, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = US$19b ÷ (US$116b - US$37b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Procter &amp; Gamble has an ROCE of 23%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 14% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble roceIn the above chart we have measured Procter &amp; Gamble's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Procter &amp; Gamble here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsProcter &amp; Gamble is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 48% over the last five years. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Procter &amp; Gamble's ROCEAs discussed above, Procter &amp; Gamble appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. And with a respectable 85% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.One more thing, we've spotted   2 warning signs  facing Procter &amp; Gamble that you might find interesting.Procter &amp; Gamble is not the only stock earning high returns.

It was based on my “everyday investing” strategy which helps identify attractive stocks that will perform well in the long term. I got the concept from Peter Lynch, the successful Fidelity portfolio manager. Lynch believed that, when amateur investors buy the stocks of companies whose products and services they are familiar with,  they have an advantage over professional investors. For my June 2021 article, I chose growing companies whose products and services I used. I also only  included companies whose cash flow was positive or close to entering the black.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor this article, I chose three stocks to buy that were not included in my June 2021 article. Each of the names in this article pays a dividend and has generated at least $500 million of cash flow from operations in the last 12 months for which they’ve reported financial results.Most importantly, the five-year annualized total returns of these three stocks are greater than that of the Morningstar US Market TR USD, and they are liked by analysts. (According to Morningstar, its index “measures the performance of US securities and targets 97% market capitalization coverage of the investable universe.”)Utilizing my everyday investing strategy is one way to get back some of the money you’ve spent on buying these companies’ products.SBUXStarbucks$95.50PEPPepsiCo$179PGProcter &amp; Gamble$140Starbucks (SBUX)Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a StrategySource: monticello / Shutterstock.com I drink Starbucks’ (NASDAQ:SBUX) coffee daily.

She can’t get enough of the fizzy water. We exchange our two used canisters for two new ones every few weeks, eliminating our use of plastic bottlesIt has been more than four years since PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) acquired Sodastream for $3.2 billion. At the time, then-CEO Indra Nooyi said, “Together, we can advance our shared vision of a healthier, more-sustainable planet.” While SodaStream’s sales only increased 2.7% year-over-year in the first 39 weeks of 2022, to $18.1 billion,  its operating profit soared 150% YOY to $4.87 billion. Sodastream is an integral part of the company’s overall revenues and profits. Both SodaStream and Frito-Lay North America have generated large amounts of revenue for PepsiCo.PEP pays an annual dividend of $4.60,  putting its yield at 2.6%. Its trailing 12-month cash flow is $11.29 billion, and its five-year annualized total return through Nov. 4 was 12.50%, 3.29 percentage points higher than the Morningstar US Market TR USD. The company isn’t sitting on its laurels. On Nov. 1, it launched Frito-Lay Minis, which are bite-sized versions of Doritos, Cheetos, and SunChips.

Just off the top of my head, Bounty, Head &amp; Shoulders, and Dawn come to mind.Despite having more than 20 brands that generate at least $1 billion of annual revenue each, PG stock has not always fared well. In its fiscal 2022, it is down more than 17% despite its annual sales climbing 5% year-over-year to $80.2 billion. Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, its sales climbed  7% YOY. On the bottom line, its earnings per share, excluding certain items, increased 3% YOY to $5.81. P&amp;G has pricing power. That’s vital in an economy like the one we are experiencing now. In fiscal Q1, the company’s sales, excluding acquisitions, increased 7% YOY due to a 9% price increase offset by lower volumes and foreign exchange fluctuations. All five of its operating segments generated positive sales growth in the quarter.P&amp;G pays an annual dividend of $3.65, equating to a 2.7% yield,. Its trailing 12-month cash flow is $16.15 billion, and its five-year annualized total return through Nov. 4 was 11.67%, 2.46 percentage points higher than that of the Morningstar US Market TR USD. During Q1, it paid out $2.26 billion of dividends to its shareholders and repurchased $4 billion of its own shares.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 79% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Sherwin-Williams, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Sherwin-Williams?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Sherwin-Williams already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Sherwin-Williams' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Sherwin-Williams. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.3% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 21 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Sherwin-WilliamsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Sherwin-Williams Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$179m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Sherwin-Williams. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.

If you want to see more of the fastest growing economies in Africa, go directly to the 5 Fastest Growing Economies in Africa.Africa's economy started recovering in 2021 following the disastrous consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its gross domestic output increased significantly in 2021 by an estimated 6.9%. The anticipated real GDP growth for Africa in 2021 was higher than both the global average and other regions' growth rates. Four of Africa's top six countries had an increase in their Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) readings, indicating an improvement in economic activity. Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa's PMI values in 2021 (which collectively accounted for 52% of Africa's GDP in 2021) were usually over the 50-point threshold and closer to pre-pandemic levels. This comes after the continent saw a 1.6% shrinkage brought on by the pandemic in 2020. North Africa (11.7%) and East Africa (4.8%) had the fastest growth. The increase was ascribed to the recovery in oil prices and global demand as well as the uptick in household spending and investment in the majority of nations following the easing of restrictions.Overall, macroeconomic fundamentals have improved, but there are still many challenges to face in the near future. The global macroeconomic headwinds and instability caused by the war between Russia and Ukraine may cause growth to slow to 4.1% in 2022 and stagnate there in 2023. The PMI rating for four of Africa's six major economies decreased in March 2022 due the start of the Russia-Ukraine war in February 2022.IMF African Department Director Abebe Aemro Selassie thinks that the effects of the Ukraine war — primarily an increase in gasoline and food prices — would be felt by everyone. According to the World Bank, the combined consequences of the Ukraine war, massive debts, and climate change have hampered Africa's economic progress.Story continuesAfrican countries have tremendous economic potential with rewarding opportunities for investors. Therefore, despite so many obstacles, a number of African countries have been able to expand their economies, which was primarily made possible by advances in underlying infrastructure that accelerated the convergence of underdeveloped regions with national levels. Other countries have profited from rising oil prices. For all of the countries on our 12 Fastest Growing Economies in Africa list, each is growing faster than 5% in terms of GDP growth as of 2021.Major global mining companies like Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), and Freeport-McMoRan, Inc. (NYSE:FCX) are also investing heavily in Africa. Technology startups are also sprouting all over the continent, with huge investments from companies like Google, Apple and Amazon.Photo by Jacques Nel on UnsplashMethodologyWe used the data from the World Bank's annual GDP growth 2021 list to compile our ranking of the 12 fastest-growing economies in Africa.Fastest Growing Economies in Africa12. Ethiopia GDP growth in 2021 according to World Bank: 5.64%Ethiopia is the second-most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, with an anticipated 117 million residents in 2021. With 6.1% growth in FY2020/21, it also saw the strongest economic growth on the continent. Ethiopia's economy, however, slowed to 5.6% growth in 2021 due to the civil war and COVID-19's repercussions on the travel and hotel industries. From 20.4% in 2020 to 26.7% in 2021, inflation rose far beyond the central bank's 8% objective. GDP growth is predicted to dip to 4.8% in 2022 before rebounding to 5.7% in 2023, with industry, private consumption, and investment driving development.11. Republic of the CongoGDP growth in 2021 according to World Bank: 5.71%Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) growth had a remarkable comeback, rising from 1.7% in 2020 to a projected 5.7% in 2021, far higher than the 4.5% average in sub-Saharan Africa. The strength of the nation's mining and services sectors was a key factor in the robust rebound. In a setting characterized by the continuance of the COVID-19 epidemic and the worldwide repercussions of the Russia-Ukraine war, the prognosis is encouraging but remains precarious. The accelerated vaccination campaign, increased oil production, and dynamics in the agricultural and mining sectors are projected to stifle GDP growth to 4.3% in 2022 and 3.2% in 2023, respectively.However, the mining sector in the country remain strong and major players like Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), and Freeport-McMoRan, Inc. (NYSE:FCX) are bringing millions in investments.10. ZimbabweGDP growth in 2021 according to World Bank: 5.85%Zimbabwe's economic growth accelerated to an anticipated 5.9% in 2021 from a 6.2% fall in 2020 due to a bountiful harvest that expanded agriculture by 36.2% in 2021 as opposed to 4.2% growth in 2020. The per capita GDP also increased, jumping by 4.9% in 2021 after declining by 6.7% in 2020. However, in 2022, economic growth was held down by unstable prices and deteriorating agricultural circumstances. The real GDP growth rate is anticipated to decrease from 5.8% in 2021 to 3.4% in 2022.9. SenegalGDP growth in 2021 according to World Bank: 6.06%Senegal stands ninth on the list of 12 of the fastest growing economies in Africa. With 6.1% growth in 2021 compared to 1.3% in 2020, the economy started to recover, in part because of the Adjusted and Accelerated Priority Action Plan. The return of the extractive industry, building and commercial activities related to high demand, as well as transportation services, were the main drivers of this growth. The recovery is predicted to slow down in 2022 to 4.6% owing to the consequences of the Russia-Ukraine war. However, it is estimated to rebound in 2023 to 8.2% thanks to governmental and private investments as well as increased oil and gas extraction. Oil and food prices will rise, causing inflation to reach 3.2% in 2022 before dropping to 2.2% in 2023.8. BeninGDP growth in 2021 according to World Bank: 6.60%The cornerstones of Benin's economy continue to be agriculture and transit trade with Nigeria, both official and unofficial. The GDP growth rate for Benin increased to 6.6% in 2021 from 3.8% in 2020. The major forces behind this expansion were the service and construction industries. Inflationary pressures have increased significantly since the end of 2021, when annual inflation was only 1.7% on average. Since the beginning of the crisis in Ukraine, inflation has intensified and is being driven by increasing food and petroleum product costs. In 2022 and 2023, growth is expected to be 6.1% and 6.4%, respectively. These predictions rely on changes in the corporate environment, governmental financial management, and agriculture sector governance.7. Burkina Faso GDP growth in 2021 according to World Bank: 6.90%In 2021, Burkina Faso's economy saw a remarkable recovery, expanding by an estimated 6.9%. The recovery in the service sector (+10.4%) and the continued rise in gold exports were the main drivers of this expansion. The primary sector contracted by 4.1% as a result of the drop in agricultural production brought on by the lack of rain. In 2021, the gold industry helped exports grow by 6.5%, while imports increased by 15.5%, primarily as a result of increases in the price of hydrocarbons and electricity. In 2022, the predicted rate of growth is 4.3%. This slowdown in GDP can be attributed to a number of factors, including the decline in private investment, the rise of insecurity in some mining and agricultural areas, and the Russia-Ukraine war and its effects on prices for food, fertilizer, and petroleum products.6. MoroccoGDP growth in 2021 according to World Bank: 7.37%Morocco is a North African country known for its agriculture, phosphate minerals, and tourism. Following Morocco's first recession in 20 years, export performance, the low-base effect, and an outstanding 2020–21 agricultural season all contributed to GDP growth of 7.37% in 2021. However, a sudden downturn in economic activity brought on by a variety of concurrent reasons led to GDP growth falling to just 0.3% in the first quarter of 2022. Another drought, the third in the preceding four years, and its repercussions, were to blame for this. Furthermore, because it imports food and energy, Morocco has suffered greatly from the increases in commodity prices brought on by the crisis in Ukraine.As the African economy comes back to normal, major mining companies like Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), and Freeport-McMoRan, Inc. (NYSE:FCX) are beginning to operate in the continent with huge resources. Click to continue reading and see 5 Fastest Growing Economies in Africa. Suggested articles:10 Best Fast Growth Stocks To Buy10 Most Promising Gene Therapy CompaniesDividend Kings List By YieldDisclosure: None. 12 Fastest Growing Economies in Africa is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

To skip the detailed analysis of the copper industry, go directly to the Top 5 Copper Producing Countries in The World. Copper is one of the most commonly used and important metals in the world. According to Data Bridge Market Research, the global copper market size was around $304.79 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $453.756 billion in 2029 at a CAGR of 5.1%. China is the world’s largest consumer of refined copper in the world. It consumed 52% of the global copper volume in 2021.Covid-19 ImpactLike most industries, copper was also significantly affected by the pandemic. Compared to 2019, copper mining experienced a 2.9% decline in 2020, due to labor shortages, supply constraints, and mine closures. However, due to high demand paired with supply constraints, the copper market boomed in 2021 and crossed $10,000 per metric tonne in May 2021. The metal reached its peak at the end of March 2022, to $10230.89, and dropped substantially to $7651 at the end of October. The decline in prices came due to weaker demand from China since April 2022.In 2021, $88.6 billion worth of copper was exported from 25 countries across the globe, representing a 52.1% increase on a YoY basis. Chile was the leader with $26.7 billion worth of exports, representing approximately 30% of all the exported copper ore.Growth CatalystCopper has always had a high demand for electronics due to its malleability and high conductivity. Moreover, the demand for copper is expected to increase as the world moves towards renewable energy sources and the electrification of vehicles. According to International Energy Agency, the global copper demand could double by 2040.Top Copper-Producing CompaniesThe Chilean government-owned company Codelco was the world’s largest copper-producing company with 1.78 million metric tonnes of copper produced in 2021.

It was based on my “everyday investing” strategy which helps identify attractive stocks that will perform well in the long term. I got the concept from Peter Lynch, the successful Fidelity portfolio manager. Lynch believed that, when amateur investors buy the stocks of companies whose products and services they are familiar with,  they have an advantage over professional investors. For my June 2021 article, I chose growing companies whose products and services I used. I also only  included companies whose cash flow was positive or close to entering the black.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor this article, I chose three stocks to buy that were not included in my June 2021 article. Each of the names in this article pays a dividend and has generated at least $500 million of cash flow from operations in the last 12 months for which they’ve reported financial results.Most importantly, the five-year annualized total returns of these three stocks are greater than that of the Morningstar US Market TR USD, and they are liked by analysts. (According to Morningstar, its index “measures the performance of US securities and targets 97% market capitalization coverage of the investable universe.”)Utilizing my everyday investing strategy is one way to get back some of the money you’ve spent on buying these companies’ products.SBUXStarbucks$95.50PEPPepsiCo$179PGProcter &amp; Gamble$140Starbucks (SBUX)Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a StrategySource: monticello / Shutterstock.com I drink Starbucks’ (NASDAQ:SBUX) coffee daily. Sometimes I have a Cafe Americano from one of their retail locations or I brew one of their offerings from my pot at home. Either way, I have Starbucks once or twice a day. I don’t care about all the financial planners who detest my habit.SBUX pays an annual dividend of $2.12 , putting its yield at 2.3%. Over the 12 months that ended on Oct. 2, it generated operating cash flow of  $4.82 billion, and its five-year annualized total return through Nov. 4 was 12.27%. That was 3.06  percentage points higher than the Morningstar US Market TR USD. Story continuesSBUX reported much better-than-expected fiscal Q4  results on Nov. 3. Its shares jumped by more than 8% on the news on Nov. 4.Not only did Starbucks report excellent fiscal Q4 and full-year results, but it also expects its global same-store sales to climb nearly 9% in 2023.Interim CEO Howard Schultz, who came back to the company in April to guide it through a rough patch, has already hired a permanent CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, to take over for him in April.    In the decades I’ve been drinking Starbucks coffee, I’ve always seen SBUX stock rise to the occasion when times were uncertain. Now is no different. The shares are an excellent long-term buy.PepsiCo (PEP)    Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comOne of the best gifts I ever got my wife for Christmas was a Sodastream machine. She can’t get enough of the fizzy water. We exchange our two used canisters for two new ones every few weeks, eliminating our use of plastic bottlesIt has been more than four years since PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) acquired Sodastream for $3.2 billion. At the time, then-CEO Indra Nooyi said, “Together, we can advance our shared vision of a healthier, more-sustainable planet.” While SodaStream’s sales only increased 2.7% year-over-year in the first 39 weeks of 2022, to $18.1 billion,  its operating profit soared 150% YOY to $4.87 billion. Sodastream is an integral part of the company’s overall revenues and profits. Both SodaStream and Frito-Lay North America have generated large amounts of revenue for PepsiCo.PEP pays an annual dividend of $4.60,  putting its yield at 2.6%. Its trailing 12-month cash flow is $11.29 billion, and its five-year annualized total return through Nov. 4 was 12.50%, 3.29 percentage points higher than the Morningstar US Market TR USD. The company isn’t sitting on its laurels. On Nov. 1, it launched Frito-Lay Minis, which are bite-sized versions of Doritos, Cheetos, and SunChips. It looks like PepsiCo’ is going after the Pringles crowd.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)A Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) distribution center in Vandalia.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comI regularly use at least three Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) brands. Just off the top of my head, Bounty, Head &amp; Shoulders, and Dawn come to mind.Despite having more than 20 brands that generate at least $1 billion of annual revenue each, PG stock has not always fared well. In its fiscal 2022, it is down more than 17% despite its annual sales climbing 5% year-over-year to $80.2 billion. Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, its sales climbed  7% YOY. On the bottom line, its earnings per share, excluding certain items, increased 3% YOY to $5.81. P&amp;G has pricing power. That’s vital in an economy like the one we are experiencing now. In fiscal Q1, the company’s sales, excluding acquisitions, increased 7% YOY due to a 9% price increase offset by lower volumes and foreign exchange fluctuations. All five of its operating segments generated positive sales growth in the quarter.P&amp;G pays an annual dividend of $3.65, equating to a 2.7% yield,. Its trailing 12-month cash flow is $16.15 billion, and its five-year annualized total return through Nov. 4 was 11.67%, 2.46 percentage points higher than that of the Morningstar US Market TR USD. During Q1, it paid out $2.26 billion of dividends to its shareholders and repurchased $4 billion of its own shares.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
