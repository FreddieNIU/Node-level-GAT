4,16836a50-56c7-3842-8a0c-0930062b705c,NUE,2023-03-25,Why You Might Be Interested In Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) For Its Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-interested-nucor-corporation-121244652.html,1679746364,STORY,['NUE'],"[Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Nucor's shares on or after the 30th of March, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 11th of May.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.51 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$2.04 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Nucor has a trailing yield of 1.4% on the current share price of $148.65. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for Nucor Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Nucor has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 7.0% of its income after tax. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Nucor generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. The good news is it paid out just 6.6% of its free cash flow in the last year.It's positive to see that Nucor's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see Nucor's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 49% per annum for the past five years. Nucor looks like a real growth company, with earnings per share growing at a cracking pace and the company reinvesting most of its profits in the business.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Nucor has lifted its dividend by approximately 3.4% a year on average. It's good to see both earnings and the dividend have improved - although the former has been rising much quicker than the latter, possibly due to the company reinvesting more of its profits in growth.The Bottom LineIs Nucor an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Nucor has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. There's a lot to like about Nucor, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Nucor (1 is a bit concerning) you should be aware of.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Consequently, the Santa Perpetua facility now has more than 20,000 pallet positions offering storage for frozen, chilled and ambient produce.Customers in the region will be benefited from greater capacity in temperature-controlled products and services brought about by this new facility.

7,8a05c3bc-a0b9-3738-94c6-20f570538003,ARE,2023-03-25,Is American Tower (AMT) an Apt Choice for Your Portfolio Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-tower-amt-apt-choice-150203913.html,1679670123,STORY,"['AMT', 'ARE', 'TRNO']","[American Tower Corporation’s AMT extensive and geographically diversified communication real estate portfolio is well-poised to gain from the rise in capital spending by wireless carriers on the incremental demand from global 4G and 5G deployment efforts, growing wireless penetration and spectrum auctions.Moreover, AMT has a resilient and stable business model. It generates most of its revenues from non-cancellable, long-term (typically 5-10 years) tower leases with major wireless carriers and has multiple renewal period options. This assures stable revenue generation for the company.Shares of AMT, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have lost 9.6% in the quarter-to-date period compared with its industry’s fall of 6.4%. However, given the secular growth trends in the wireless industry and its robust fundamentals, the stock is likely to keep performing well in the quarters ahead. Hence the dip offers a good entry point.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmerican Tower has a solid track of delivering a healthy performance due to robust demand for its global macro tower-oriented asset base. It has witnessed strong growth in key financial metrics while continuing platform expansion. Between 2012 and 2022, AMT’s revenues from the Property segment and adjusted EBITDA grew at CAGRs of 14.1% and 13.4%, respectively.  This healthy performance is expected to continue in 2023, with management projecting property revenues and adjusted EBITDA to rise 2.9% and 4.1%, respectively, at the midpoint. We expect property revenues and adjusted EBITDA to increase 2.3% and 4.2%, respectively. In 2024, we estimate property revenues and adjusted EBITDA to report an increase of 4.1% and 9.1%, respectively.To capitalize on the tailwinds, American Tower continues to focus on macro-tower investment opportunities and expansionary efforts across global markets. In 2022, American Tower registered record organic growth complemented by the construction of nearly 7,000 sites, of which, 2,300 were built in fourth-quarter 2022. This marked the highest level over the past eight quarters.We expect an increase of 1.9%, 4% and 4.3% in 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively, in total International property revenues.American Tower is also strengthening its data center assets through acquisitions, which is encouraging.On the balance sheet front, AMT exited 2022 with total liquidity of $7.1 billion and net leverage ratio of 5.4. Moreover, its investment-grade credit ratings of BBB- and Baa3 with stable outlook from Standard &amp; Poor’s and Moody’s, respectively, enable the company to borrow at a favorable rate.In addition, its trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 15.80% compared with the industry’s average of 3.60%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and American Tower remains committed to that. In the last five years, AMT has increased its dividend 20 times and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 17.43%. Such efforts boost investors’ confidence in the stock.Nonetheless, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless are the top three customers for American Tower in terms of total revenues for 2022, contributing 18%, 17% and 11%, respectively. The loss of any of these customers, consolidation among them or reduction in network spending might adversely impact the company’s top line.Also, increasing interest rates are likely to increase borrowing costs, affecting the company’s ability to purchase or develop real estate.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Alexandria Real Estate Equities ARE, Terreno Realty TRNO and Service Properties Trust SVC.

The stock lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.56%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.41%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.35%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the maker of scientific instrument and laboratory supplies had gained 0.77% over the past month. This has outpaced the Medical sector's loss of 2.2% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 1.48% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Thermo Fisher Scientific as it approaches its next earnings report date. On that day, Thermo Fisher Scientific is projected to report earnings of $4.95 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 31.72%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $10.57 billion, down 10.58% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $23.72 per share and revenue of $45.34 billion, which would represent changes of +2.07% and +0.95%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Thermo Fisher Scientific. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

Thermo Fisher Scientific is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Story continuesDigging into valuation, Thermo Fisher Scientific currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 23.41. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 24.8, so we one might conclude that Thermo Fisher Scientific is trading at a discount comparatively.Investors should also note that TMO has a PEG ratio of 1.87 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, both Thermo Fisher Scientific and SONOVA HOLDING are holding a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.TMO currently has a forward P/E ratio of 23.41, while SONVY has a forward P/E of 23.67. We also note that TMO has a PEG ratio of 1.87. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. SONVY currently has a PEG ratio of 2.49.Another notable valuation metric for TMO is its P/B ratio of 4.95. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, SONVY has a P/B of 6.63.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, TMO holds a Value grade of B, while SONVY has a Value grade of C.Both TMO and SONVY are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that TMO is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""My plan was to take a year off school and work the part-time teller job while I figured out what I wanted to do with my life, and here I am 25 years later.""Colvin spent more than 12 years in branch banking, earning a series of promotions and working her way up to a district manager role, then joined the business banking group before she saw an opportunity on the equipment finance team in 2016.Colvin initially served as director of sales for the equipment finance team's small-ticket group, which generally supports customers with transactions below $1 million. In early 2021, she became the head of U.S. Bank Equipment Finance's manufacturing vendor services and the first woman general manager in that sales organization, serving clients across the United States.As its name implies, manufacturing vendor services provides financing for manufacturers in metal-cutting, plastics, woodworking, glass, stone and other manufacturing industries to purchase or upgrade equipment. The U.S. Bank team works with equipment manufacturers to provide financing to their industrial customers in a fashion similar to auto manufacturers providing financing to consumers.""I'm always of the mindset that great leaders ask great questions, and my team would certainly tell you I ask a lot of them.""- Anita ColvinColvin wasn't an expert on the ins and outs of manufacturing when she accepted this leadership position.""When I took this role, I knew enough about manufacturing to be dangerous, and I still continue to learn every day,"" she said. ""In my sales organization, we have folks who have been in this space for many years and are experts because they're working on transactions every day. I'm always of the mindset that great leaders ask great questions, and my team would certainly tell you I ask a lot of them.""Story continuesColvin takes pride in being the first woman to serve in her role.Traditionally, there has not been a large representation of women in senior leadership positions in the equipment finance industry, especially within the sales organizations, she said.""There has been a big focus in the industry to change that,"" Colvin said. ""The workforce is becoming more diverse, which is exciting.""Colvin is active in diversity efforts, serving as an advocate for women in several professional organizations. She serves as the treasurer on the Women in Manufacturing Oregon Chapter Board, an organization focused on supporting, promoting and inspiring women in the manufacturing industry. She is also a member of the U.S. Bank Women's Business Resource Group and an active mentor in both the internship and MentorConnect programs at U.S. Bank.""I'm absolutely trying to help other women follow my path,"" she said. ""Creating a diverse team is a critical piece of moving forward. When we all think alike, we limit our long-term growth.""While the industry may be traditionally male-dominated, Colvin said she hasn't faced a great deal of bias.""People have been extremely open and welcoming, giving me the grace to ask questions and learn,"" she said. ""I've been so blessed to have great mentors and sponsors at the bank who advocated for me.""The people Anita interacts with are what she likes most about the job.""Whether it's working with my team or working with our clients or customers, it's really about building mutually beneficial relationships,"" she said.

For those of you interested, check out 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Dividend stocks have faced headwinds in the past given the rise in interest rates which have led to higher Treasury yields. With higher Treasury yields, capital has moved from the broader equity market into the U.S. Treasury market and the valuations of many leading dividend stocks are arguably lower than what they would have been as a result.In terms of interest rates, the Federal Reserve on March 22 raised interest rates by 25 basis points to bring the benchmark funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%.After the interest rate raise, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said, ""We believe, however, that events in the banking system over the past two weeks are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which would in turn affect economic outcomes. It is too soon to determine the extent of these effects, and therefore too soon to tell it how monetary policy should respond. As a result, we no longer state that we anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate to quell inflation. Instead, we now anticipate that some additional policy firming may be appropriate.""Story continuesWith the Federal Reserve Chairman's comments, the broader markets declined on March 22 as the market didn't like Powell's commentary on credit conditions. Recently, Deutsche Bank stock has declined on March 24 as its credit default swaps have increased. Given Deutsche Bank is a huge bank, any substantial financial difficulties Deutsche Bank faces could affect the global economy if regulators don't do enough to contain the situation.Given the economic outcomes could be negative, an economic slowdown could also negatively affect leading dividend stocks. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.chrisdorney/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 13 Best Long Term Dividend Stocks to Buy Now, we chose 13 stocks that have competitive advantages and growth potential in the long term that also pay a dividend.We ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q4.For those of you interested, check out 14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.13 Best Long Term Dividend Stocks to Buy Now13.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.MetLife in FocusHeadquartered in New York, MetLife (MET) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -24.97% so far this year. The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.5 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.68%. This compares to the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield of 2.36% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.81%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2 is up 1% from last year. In the past five-year period, MetLife has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 4.54%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. MetLife's current payout ratio is 29%. This means it paid out 29% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for MET for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $8.29 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 21.02%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, MET is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Over the past two weeks, a general bearish and risk-off sentiment cut across asset markets and triggered a lengthy unwind of speculative positions in oil futures. A top commodity analyst blamed the unusually steep decline to significant selling by banks in response to gamma-effects as prices closed in a concentration of producer puts around USD 75/bbl for Brent and USD 70/bbl for WTI crude.Luckily for the bulls, in the current week, oil prices have staged a remarkable turnaround, with Brent climbing from a two-year low around $70 per barrel on Monday to USD 77.20 per barrel on Thurday’s intraday session while WTI has recovered from around $63 per barrel to $71.20 over the timeframe. That’s a nearly 10% rally in the space of just three days.And now commodity experts at Standard Chartered are saying that the path of least resistance for oil prices at this point is higher, not lower. Previously, the analysts had said that the unwinding of speculative length appears to be complete at this juncture, thus lowering selling pressure, but had warned that prices might retest the lows if the FOMC hikes its policy rate by more than the widely expected margin of 25bps.Related: Spain Calls On Importers Not To Sign New LNG Deals With RussiaThankfully, the markets have successfully scaled that wall of worry after the Fed’s hike on Wednesday came in-line with expectations. The Fed also indicated that the current rate hike cycle is nearing an end.Fast RecoveryIt gets better for the bulls: StanChart expects last week’s gamma effects to reverse course with banks buying back positions thus reinforcing the short-term rebound. Beyond that, StanChart says oil prices will largely be dictated by OPEC’s and consuming countries’ strategic inventory policy shifts.Specifically, the experts have predicted the current surplus will persist till early Q2; however, they expect the rest of the year to be in a modest deficit.Story continuesSource: Standard Chartered ResearchStanChart is not the only oil bull here.Goldman Sachs' Jeffrey Currie has acknowledged that the unexpected banking crisis has soured the macroeconomic outlook significantly and weighed heavily on oil prices, calling the situation a ""big, scarring event."" Still, the analyst expects prices to rally from here, and has only lowered his 2023 end-of-year target from $100 to $94 a barrel.According to Currie, fundamentals in the oil markets remain largely unchanged thus supporting the previous bull case. He has pointed out that key physical indicators, such as refining margins and time spreads, have remained stable, a positive sign that in-use demand remains strong and is likely to continue driving the physical market higher. Currie has also argued that the banking crisis will only have short-lived effects but very limited impact over the long-term, ""I think the key message here is fundamentally we haven't seen a big significant shift,"" he said. ""Physical markets are going to have to drive this market higher.""However, he has warned that the turmoil will result in a ""... a longer path forward.""Hedge fund manager Pierre Andurand of Andurand Capital is not a mere bull but an ultra-bull:  Andurand has predicted that crude will hit $140/bbl by the end of the year. Just like Currie, Andrurand argues that the recent oil price crash due to banking jitters was purely speculative. Further, he expects crude oil demand to peak around 2030, but ""even when we peak, oil demand won't fall down so fast. We will reach peak demand towards 110M bbl/day and then a slow decline from there.""Oil and gas stocks have also been surging higher in tandem with the commodities they track: the energy sector’s benchmark, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE), is up 4.1% since the beginning of the week.After posting record profits for two straight years amid high oil and gas prices, earnings for the energy sector are only expected to decline modestly in the current year compared to other market sectors. Late last year, a  Moody's research report projected that industry earnings will stabilize overall in 2023, though they will come in slightly below levels reached by recent peaks. The analysts note that commodity prices have declined from very high levels earlier in 2022, but have predicted that prices are likely to remain cyclically strong through 2023. This, combined with modest growth in volumes, will support strong cash flow generation for oil and gas producers. Moody’s estimates that the U.S. energy sector’s EBITDA for 2023 will clock in at $585, good for a modest 6% decline from 2022 levels.Valuations in the oil and gas sector also remain low despite two years of strong rallies with many energy and gas stocks trading at large discounts to the market.By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:EU Ban On Russian Fuel Leads To Diesel Glut In AsiaU.S. Jobs Data Provides Support For Oil After Volatile WeekNew EU Laws May Hurt The Energy TransitionRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

(NYSE: FE) electric company personnel are prepared to respond to service interruptions caused by a storm system that is expected to bring high winds and heavy rain this weekend to Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.FirstEnergy Corp. Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)Company meteorologists have been tracking the storm for several days. The system is expected to bring periods of significant rainfall, strong wind gusts of more than 50 miles per hour and potential thunderstorms to central and eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania and western West Virginia on Saturday. With rain accumulations of more than four inches possible in some areas, localized flooding could occur. Precipitation began late Thursday and is expected to continue into late Saturday for many areas, while sustained winds and heavy gusts, peaking Saturday afternoon, are expected through early Sunday morning.The winds and rain could slow restoration efforts, as crews cannot safely operate bucket trucks when wind speeds exceed 40 miles per hour. Saturated soil and flooding can also hinder access and create hazardous conditions for crews as they work to make repairs to lines and equipment damaged by fallen trees and branches.""While we invest in our electric system throughout the year to enhance reliability for customers, high winds and heavy rain have the potential to cause power outages and can also pose challenges to our crews as they work to make repairs,"" said Sam Belcher, senior vice president of FirstEnergy and president of FirstEnergy Utilities. ""We are taking every step to ensure we are prepared to restore electric service to customers as quickly and safely as possible.""FirstEnergy's electric companies are implementing storm response plans, which include staffing additional operators, damage assessors and analysts at distribution control centers, and arranging to bring in additional line, substation and forestry personnel, as needed, based on the severity of the weather. In addition, the company has notified contractors to be ready to assist with restoration efforts. FirstEnergy representatives have also been in contact with emergency management officials, state officials, regulators and local officials about the company's storm preparation efforts.Story continuesHow to Report Power Outages and Downed Lines Customers who experience a service interruption due to the storm are encouraged to report their outage by calling 1-888-LIGHTSS (1-888-544-4877), texting OUT to LIGHTS (544487) or clicking the ""Report Outage"" link on www.firstenergycorp.com.FirstEnergy customers can sign up to receive email and text message alert notifications for updates after they've reported a power outage. Customers can also use two-way text messaging to report outages, request updates on restoration efforts and make other inquiries about their electric accounts. More information about these communication tools is available at www.firstenergycorp.com/connect.High winds and saturated soil can bring down trees and branches onto power lines. Customers should assume all downed or low-hanging power lines are energized and dangerous. Stay at least 30 feet away and use extra caution where downed lines are tangled in trees or other debris. Report downed lines ASAP by calling 911.For updated information on the company's current outages, the company's storm restoration process and tips for staying safe, visit FirstEnergy's 24/7 Power Center at www.firstenergycorp.com/outages.Customers Encouraged to Prepare in Advance of the StormFirstEnergy encourages customers to plan for the possibility of power outages due to the impending storm by following these tips:Keep electronic devices such as cell phones, laptops and tablets fully charged.Have a car charger on-hand to charge mobile devices if your power is out. If you have a smart phone, this will ensure you have access to online information sources.Keep a flashlight, portable radio and extra batteries handy in the event of a power outage. Tune to a local station for current storm information.Do not use gas stoves, kerosene heaters or other open-flame heat sources to prevent deadly carbon monoxide gas from building up in your home.If you have a water well and pump, keep an emergency supply of bottled water and/or fill your bathtub with fresh water.Stock an emergency supply of convenience foods that do not require cooking.Consider having a hard-wired phone available to report an outage or emergency. A plain, hard-wired phone can operate on power delivered through the phone line.Operate Backup Generators SafelyEmergency power generators offer an option for customers needing or wanting uninterrupted service. To ensure the safety of the home's occupants as well as that of electric company employees who may be working on power lines in the area, the proper generator should be selected and installed by a qualified electrician.When operating a generator, the power coming into the home should always be disconnected. Otherwise, power from the generator could be sent back onto the power lines, creating a hazardous situation for company workers. Locate the generator outside of your home and far away from windows, doors and vents. Never locate a generator inside your home.View additional generator safety information.FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence.

He added that consultant Bain &amp; Co., which Salesforce is working with to review the business, has yet to provide final recommendations.After years of hiring and big acquisitions, the software company is newly focused on profitability. Salesforce in January announced it would eliminate 10% of its workforce, or about 8,000 employees, its largest-ever headcount reduction, and close offices across the US. A group of activist investors who have taken stakes in the company are pushing to cut costs further in search of increased earnings and improved profit margins.Salesforce wouldn’t be alone in the industry if it wiped out more jobs. Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon Inc. and Twilio Inc. announced additional rounds of major cuts in recent weeks, amounting to more 21,000 workers.Millham, who joined the company as its 13th employee in 1999 and was promoted to chief operating officer last year, said he’s focused on making the sales and go-to-market divisions he oversees more efficient, and finding new selling opportunities, such as with the company’s recently announced AI products. He has taken over some of the operational and customer-facing responsibilities previously held by co-Chief Executive Officer Bret Taylor before that executive left the company earlier this year, including appearances on earnings calls.Story continuesThe San Francisco-based company, the top maker of customer relations management software, has been looking at measures including reducing the number of salespeople assigned to each deal, utilizing third-party sellers and emphasizing productivity such as monthly sales targets, Millham said. Salesforce also is urging employees to go into the office more often, although it hasn’t imposed a return-to-office mandate. Attendance at company sites is up significantly in recent months, he said.“From the very beginning this was a performance-oriented culture,” Millham said. “We may have drifted a bit from that during the pandemic as we took care of our employees and made sure everyone was staying healthy.” He added that he wants Salesforce to have both a performance and wellness culture.The stock has jumped 43% this year, closing at $190.06 Friday in New York, making up almost all of its value after a 48% plunge in 2022.Investors rejoiced earlier this month when the company said it would reach margin targets years earlier than anticipated. “We feel pretty good about what we’ve been able to deliver so far,” Millham said, before adding “it’s not a job that’s done by any stretch.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Texas Preacher’s $24 Million Ponzi SchemeSVB’s Collapse Shows the World’s Favorite Safe Asset Isn’t Risk-FreeCollege Students Are About to Put a Robot on the Moon Before NASAChina Lent Heavily to Developing Nations.

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends Salesforce.com (CRM) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this customer-management software developer is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Salesforce.com is 23.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 35.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 11.3%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Salesforce.com is 12.1%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 5.9%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 36% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Salesforce.com have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 54.2% over the past month.Bottom LineSalesforce.com has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Salesforce.com well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With talks of an impending recession, everyone is looking for safer options. However, Shelby Davis once famously said, “Invest for the long haul. Don’t get too greedy, and don’t get too scared.”Although stock indexes are lackluster, it’s important to think ahead to the next bull market, regardless of whether it’s imminent or further down the line. Focusing on the future will allow you to prepare your portfolio for the worst-case scenario. It will also position you for success when the market inevitably improves.Selecting the best stocks with potential can be challenging for investors. While some stocks with potential can offer rapid returns as optimism about the future rises, a souring outlook can lead to a significant decline in value. Therefore, it’s recommended that investors opt for proven companies with a track record of expansion and success.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhile past performance does not guarantee future returns, it’s reasonable to assume that companies riding big-picture trends will probably continue growing as long as they persist.

As a result, the company consistently achieves sales and profit growth.

This impressive expansion is a testament to the company’s significant progress over the years, with its cancer screening tests gaining widespread acceptance.Despite progress in reducing losses, the company’s financials still present a challenge, with a net loss of $127.7 million, or $0.72 per share, in the fourth quarter, compared to the previous year’s net loss of $220.6 million, or $1.28 per share. This financial setback might give some investors pause, especially given the current bearish market environment.Exact Sciences will only grow from here.

Over the past ten years, Visa’s PE ratio range has been between 19.66 (minimum) and 84.19 (maximum), with a median of 33.07. Therefore, Visa’s current PE ratio is below its historical median, showing it may be undervalued.Why is Visa stock down? Well, there are a couple of factors at play. First, we are seeing a general slowdown in growth and spending, which does not bode well for Visa’s prospects.Secondly, Visa, for the longest time, has commanded a premium in its industry. However, with the markets cooling off, investors are taking less interest in stocks with growth potential. During volatile times, investors pour capital into safer avenues such as utility and dividend stocks. We see the same trend in 2023.That opens up a great opportunity for you to look into Visa. Its latest financials confirm its health and vitality. Visa beat first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings estimates, fueled by a rise in cross-border travel. After adjustments, the company earned $4.6 billion, or $2.18 per share. The revenue generated was $7.9 billion under generally accepted accounting principles.And the growth story is not over.The worldwide trend toward cashless payments has been ongoing for years, but significant growth potential remains, particularly in emerging markets. Accounting firm PwC Global estimates that cashless payment volumes could double globally by 2030.Despite the highly competitive nature of the payments industry, Visa, as the market leader, is likely to grow along with the industry.Salesforce (CRM)lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco.

As the industry’s gold standard, Salesforce holds an outstanding position in this field.Salesforce’s position as the industry leader in customer relationship management makes it the preferred choice for new market entrants. Existing customers have greater revenue potential with ongoing product features and pricing enhancements. This established market dominance makes it highly improbable for any firm to challenge Salesforce’s position anytime soon.However, the pressure has been increasing on Salesforce lately. The cloud software pioneer is under increasing pressure to prioritize profitability, leading to the departure of several executives.This is a common occurrence at the end of an era, which, in this case, is the end of the easy-money economic policy era. The US Federal Reserve’s hawkish interest rate hikes aimed at combating inflation contributed to this shift.Salesforce’s potential for growth warrants its inclusion in this list of stocks with potential, despite modest profits alongside strong revenue growth. Management acknowledges the need for change to sustain investor interest.The company is taking profitability more seriously, with predicted profit margin expansion and introducing a share repurchase program to return excess cash to shareholders by reducing the overall share count.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase Ralph Lauren's shares on or after the 30th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 14th of April.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.75 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.00 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Ralph Lauren has a trailing yield of 2.7% on the current share price of $111.09. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether Ralph Lauren has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately Ralph Lauren's payout ratio is modest, at just 39% of profit. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Ralph Lauren generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out an unsustainably high 241% of its free cash flow as dividends over the past 12 months, which is worrying. Unless there were something in the business we're not grasping, this could signal a risk that the dividend may have to be cut in the future.While Ralph Lauren's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Were this to happen repeatedly, this would be a risk to Ralph Lauren's ability to maintain its dividend.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. For this reason, we're glad to see Ralph Lauren's earnings per share have risen 17% per annum over the last five years. Earnings have been growing at a decent rate, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Ralph Lauren has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.5% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpIs Ralph Lauren worth buying for its dividend? We're glad to see the company has been improving its earnings per share while also paying out a low percentage of income. However, it's not great to see it paying out what we see as an uncomfortably high percentage of its cash flow. It might be worth researching if the company is reinvesting in growth projects that could grow earnings and dividends in the future, but for now we're not all that optimistic on its dividend prospects.So while Ralph Lauren looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. For example, Ralph Lauren has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is significant) we think you should know about.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

SKX appears encouraging on the back of robust business strategies. The company remains focused on boosting its omni-channel capabilities by expanding its direct-to-consumer (DTC) business and enhancing its foothold internationally. SKX has been gaining from growth in its domestic and international channels for a while now. Continued global demand for its Comfort Technology footwear is steadily driving results.This footwear leader has appreciated 34.9% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s 24.7% growth. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Skechers’ 2023 sales and earnings per share (EPS) is currently pegged at $7.92 billion and $2.95 each, suggesting respective growth of 6.4% and 24% from the corresponding year-ago reported figures. For 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and EPS stands at $8.80 billion and $3.66 each, indicating corresponding increases of 11.1% and 24.2% from the prior-year reported numbers. This reflects the analysts’ optimism about the stock.Let’s Delve DeeperSkechers has been making strategic investments to improve the infrastructure worldwide, primarily e-commerce platforms and distribution centers. The company is focused on designing and developing new products. Going ahead, SKX plans to introduce more innovative and comfortable technology products, build multi-platform marketing campaigns and launch more e-commerce sites around the world.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSkechers has been directing resources to enhance its digital capabilities, including augmenting website features, mobile applications and a loyalty program. Investments made to integrate store and digital ecosystems for developing a seamless omnichannel experience are likely to drive greater sales. The company has updated its point-of-sale systems to better engage with customers, both offline and online. Initiatives such as “Buy Online, Pick-Up in Store” and “Buy Online, Pickup at Curbside” are worth mentioning.During the fourth quarter of 2022, Skechers’ DTC sales grew 10.8% year over year to $829.6 million. This is backed by 30% growth domestically with a triple-digit increase in e-commerce and a double-digit increase in retail stores. Both these channels gained from solid inventory levels. International DTC sales were flat year over year owing to a decline in China. However, excluding China, sales rose 22% on double-digit increases across the company’s stores and online. DTC sales jumped on growth of 27% in AMER and 19.1% in EMEA. DTC volumes also jumped 14.8% year over year.Furthermore, Skechers’ international business remains a significant sales growth driver for the company. SKX is poised to enhance its global reach in the footwear market through its distribution networks, subsidiaries and joint ventures. In fourth-quarter 2022, international sales increased 8.7% year over year. Region-wise, sales increased 22.5% year over year to $925.6 million in the Americas and 28.9% to $413.7 million in EMEA.Wrapping up, Skechers is likely to continue performing well on the back of such sturdy endeavors. The company’s 2023 outlook reflects sales momentum across most of the company’s international markets throughout the year. A China market recovery with a steady improvement in the course of the year, better distribution operating efficiency on enhanced capacity and remediation endeavors are tailwinds.Story continuesAlso, the gross margin is likely to benefit from lower logistics costs mainly in freight. For 2023, management believes in accomplishing sales between $7.75 billion and $8 billion and earnings per share between $2.80 and $3.00.

The company’s multichannel strategy is progressing well, with the addition of eight stores during the fourth quarter. Management projects revenues from the China JV to double in 2023. It predicts Saucony revenues to increase mid-single digits in 2023 with high-single digits growth in the first quarter. Further, it predicts Sweaty Betty revenues to increase in the low single digits in 2023. With respect to Sweaty Betty, it introduced one pop-up in China and intends to open 10 stores in 2023 mainly in the U.K. and Ireland. The international business remains one of the key revenue drivers.

The performance was further boosted by the top three brands, which represented more than 50% of the international revenues. Wolverine plans to invest in key growth markets and continue to invest in the international regions, with joint ventures for Merrell and Saucony, and expand e-commerce capabilities globally.Story continuesWhat Else?Management expects the profitability to grow significantly in the second half of 2023 as supply-chain costs and inventory levels normalize, and also gain from the Profit Improvement Office efforts. For 2023, revenues from the ongoing business are projected in the range of $2.53-$2.58 billion, representing an increase of 0-2% and constant currency growth of 1-3%.

39,7bd77fc5-18ea-3ca1-a52d-66370f9e8cac,PCG,2023-03-25,21 Biggest Bankruptcies in American History,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/21-biggest-bankruptcies-american-history-140746832.html,1679666866,STORY,"['BAC', 'PCGU', 'FRC']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 21 biggest bankruptcies in American history. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest bankruptcies in American history.""Bankruptcy"" is a term in fashion in 2023, and hasn't been this popular in almost 15 years since the 2008 Great Recession which led to the folding of some huge companies. Had we written this article just a month ago, there would be two changes in this list, two bankruptcies which have resulted in a global crisis that we still don't know the extent of. While bankruptcies are common not just in the U.S. but globally, as successfully running a business is a lot more difficult than TedTalks and motivational speakers would have you believe, major bankruptcies are generally quite uncommon. You can compare this list to our earlier work if you visit the 15 biggest companies that went bankrupt.After the 2008 Great Recession which resulted in some of the biggest bankruptcies in American history as well as the folding of several smaller businesses, some of the biggest financial institutions in the U.S. were deemed systemically important or colloquially referred to as ""too big to fail"", including most of the biggest banks in America by asset size.While major banks in the U.S. haven't seen a failure since the Great Recession, 2023 saw that scenario change completely, with Silicon Valley Bank collapsing in March. Silicon Valley Bank, like most major and minor financial institutions, had invested heavily in governmental bonds when interest rates were hovering near zero. However, when record inflation hit the globe including the U.S. in 2022, the Federal Reserve Board (Fed) responded by hiking interest rates consistently throughout the year, continuing into 2023. Because of this rise in interest rates, the face value of the bonds that SVB had invested in declined. Now, normally, that wouldn't be an issue as if held to maturity, the decline in value would either likely recover or not be as significant, and any current losses would remain unrealized. Unfortunately, because SVB's clientele largely comprised of tech startups whose cashflows aren't as strong, when the cost of borrowing increased because of higher interest rates, these companies had to take out their deposits because of which SVB had to sell its bonds.Story continues21 Biggest Bankruptcies in American HistoryPakhnyushchy/Shutterstock.comThe biggest misstep though, came from SVB's CEO announcing the company's losses and the requirement to raise capital to the public, when the capital had not yet been raised, and wouldn't generally have been considered to be a problem, but because of the public announcement, panic abounded and a bank run was made, resulting in around $42 billion being withdrawn in a single day, leaving the bank with a negative balance of $1 billion, and resulting in the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovations shutting down the bank. This was followed just a few days later by another huge lender in Signature Bank, thus sparking concerns of a wider banking crisis and resulting in financial institution shares plunging on 13th March. This led to the Biden administration stepping in to assuage concerns and promise to secure the deposits of all customers while simultaneously not bailing out the bank, which will cause huge losses to the company's shareholders and creditors.After the Federal Government promised to secure the banking deposits, shares rose but as concerns continued, the week commencing the 13th of March 2023 was a wildly uncertain one. One of the worst impacted banks is First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC), which has lost over 80% of its share price in just the last one month. There have been fears that First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) is on the verge of collapse, which led to a consortium of major banks, including Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) coming up with a rescue package for First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) worth $30 billion, a move attempting to show their confidence in the banking industry. However, the share price of First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) still closed 33% down even after the deal.The ramifications of the U.S. banking crisis go far beyond the country, considering the importance of its financial institutions to the global economy, which is why it was unsurprising to see European banks impacted heavily as well, none more so than Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS), the second-largest bank in Switzerland, whose share price fell by a third in just the last one month, resulting in $54 billion being offered by the Swiss National Bank as an emergency loan, and UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) acquiring Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS) on 19th March 2023, for over $2 billion.While the long-term fallout of the current situation is uncertain, it may impact the probability of the U.S. avoiding a recession after Janet Yellen, the Secretary of Treasury in the U.S., said “That could turn this into a source of significant downside economic risk.” The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) has also said that the banking crisis increases the odds of a U.S. recession in 2023, saying that the change of the U.S. entering a recession is now 35% instead of 25% in the next one year.Because of the uncertain situation right now, the biggest bankruptcies in American history may potentially change over the course of the next few months. For example, if First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) fails, its $212 billion in assets will make it one of the biggest bankruptcies in American history easily. While there have been some major bankruptcies in the cryptocurrency sphere after the collapse of FTX, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, followed by Celsius, their assets pale in comparison to the companies in our list. We have used our previous compilation of the largest bankruptcies in American history and updated them to include any major collapses which deserve to be in this list. For SVB, we have used its assets value from its website, while for Signature Bank, we used its asset value from Yahoo Finance. So now, let's take a look at the largest collapses in U.S. history, starting with:21. General Growth Properties, Inc.Assets at time of bankruptcy (in millions): $27,392General Growth Properties was a commercial real estate company which was the largest such company to declare bankruptcy in 2009, after missing a deadline to repay loans worth $900 million.20. Bank of New England CorpAssets at time of bankruptcy (in millions): $29,773Based in Boston, Bank of New England was the 18th biggest bank in the country at its peak, but met its demise in 1991, one of the oldest in our list of the biggest bankruptcies in American history.

42,42471909-dfdb-3ebd-85f3-11cfcb16ec53,MSFT,2023-03-25,How AI will change the way we work,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ai-going-change-way-100509310.html,1679738709,VIDEO,"['GOOG', 'GOOGL', 'ORCL', 'MSFT', 'ARKK', 'TSLA']","[Generative AI, augmented intelligence, machine learning- these topics have dominated the conversation around tech in 2023, and by now we’ve all heard the rumors: AI is coming for your job, it will take your family, and it will eat the food off your dinner plate, but is there any truth behind this?To find out more, we went to the ground floor of the new tech sector, where technology meets culture, and the South meets the Southwest.Webster’s dictionary defines AI as “the simulation of human behavior in computers”. Sounds harmless right? But with the exploding popularity of generative chat bots like ChatGPT, many people are reexamining where they stand on the technological food chain.Ian Beacraft is one of the leading voices in deep tech and AI. His company, Signal and Cipher, teaches large companies how to adapt to new technology.“Generative ai is here. it's in everyone's palms and it's not going anywhere,” says Ian, telling Yahoo Finance that we’ve only scratched the surface of what AI can do.“We are at the very beginning of one of the biggest revolutions in knowledge work in human history and a lot of people look at this as a large step change in the way that we do our work… what we're doing is we are digitizing skills the same way that we mechanized physical labor in the industrial revolution… we're doing things at a scale, at a volume, and at a breadth that human minds aren't really capable of.”So, will the rise of AI lead to job losses? And if so, why should we embrace this technology?We met with Garry Kasparov, the former chess Grandmaster and Avast Security Ambassador, famous for his series of chess matches against the 1980’s supercomputer, “Deep Blue”.“Every new technology in the past has threatened jobs, actually destroyed jobs, destroyed industry before creating new opportunities,” Kasparov told us.“AI is not the exception. Machines made us stronger in the past, made us faster in the past… so, many jobs we are doing today, in my view, are like zombie jobs. They're already dead. They just don't know yet.”Story continuesSo far, our experts have not painted a particularly rosy picture for the future of mankind, so we went directly to the source. You know what they say- keep your enemies close.According to ChatGPT,“Artificial intelligence has the potential to greatly impact the future of humanity in both positive and negative ways. On the positive side, AI has the potential to improve many aspects of our lives, such as healthcare, education, and transportation.”That doesn’t sound too bad, but it goes on:“One major concern is that as AI systems become more advanced, they may become difficult to control, potentially leading to unintended consequences or even catastrophic outcomes.”Therein lies the concern, and why many in the tech industry are approaching AI with a good deal of caution.“People are getting freaked out. They’re saying ‘Hey, what is this thing? Can we trust it?’”“I see both sides of the argument. and, you know, in some ways, there is a lot of opportunity, but on the other hand, we also have to be careful, just like with any technology,” says Pulkit Agrawal, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at MIT.Instead of thinking of AI as a replacement for human beings, according to Pulkit, we should think of AI as a tool.Like the invention of the PC, artificial intelligence may actually improve our work and make humans more efficient in performing our day-to-day tasks.“If an AI system can look at CT scans, and make a diagnosis, is it going to replace a doctor or not? I would say no. I think the right way to implement the system is to make the system be an advisor to a doctor, because this AI system has looked at more CT scans than any doctor could have looked in his life,” Pulkit says.While the possibilities for AI may seem limitless, it could be the key to unlocking the potential of the human brain.More Yahoo Finance coverage here:At SXSW 2023, dealmaking carries on against banking crisis backdropThe surprising companies one firm thinks will benefit from the AI 'tidal wave'US Copyright Office opens door to protecting AI-assisted works]"

Chairman Jerome Powell suggested to reporters that rates could have been hiked by 50 basis points if not for pressures in the banking system.Powell also ruled out rate cuts this year in response to a question from Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger at the Fed's press conference.Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell holds a news conference after the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on interest rate policy in Washington, U.S., March 22, 2023. REUTERS/Leah MillisAnd while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 530 points by the close of trading on Wednesday, the market stabilized on Thursday as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other top businesspeople did everything they could publicly and behind the scenes to tamp down concerns of a full-blown bank crisis.""This isn't a crisis,"" one prominent CEO told me over dinner this week, adding the situation is far less dire than the subprime mortgage crisis that led to the Great Recession. The exec blasted leaders at Silicon Valley Bank but also voiced concern about the outcome of First Republic (FRC).A person familiar with the Treasury Secretary's thinking told me the department is closely watching deposit inflows at the banks — and that suggests the financial system isn't in crisis mode.By Friday, however, market stress was back in focus as all eyes turned to Deutsche Bank (DB) and its various struggles and now dwindling stock price.In other words, another wild week!Here are five things you may have missed during another very busy week for markets.1. Nvidia's AI pushThe Street gushed over Nvidia's (NVDA) various projects and exposure to the new artificial intelligence movement at its annual GTC conference. But we also heard from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on the impact of higher interest rates — well-timed considering this was Fed meeting week.""This is the time when we all have to do more with less,"" Jensen told Yahoo Finance Live (video above), ""and accelerated computing is really the best path forward to do so.""Story continuesNvidia shares are up a sizzling 18% in March.2. Speaking of AI...Microsoft (MSFT) founder Bill Gates made his first substantive comments on AI, coming on the heels of the company he launched that is pushing deeper into the ChatGPT realm.""Superintelligent AIs are in our future,"" Gates said in a new post on his blog. Gates believes people will see AI on par with the capabilities of a human brain 10 to 100 years from now.Scary or cool, it could prove lucrative to Microsoft's bottom line over the next decade — and Gates's net worth.Microsoft founder Bill Gates reacts during a visit with Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of the Imperial College University, in central London, on February 15, 2023. (Photo by JUSTIN TALLIS/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)3. Ford, refoundedFord execs made a pitch to Wall Street at a teach-in held at the New York Exchange: We will make money on EVs by 2026.Crunching the numbers, Ford is on pace to lose more than $5 billion on an operating basis in its EV business for the combined 2022 and 2023 period. CEO Jim Farley told me he's ready to go after Tesla's lucrative profit margins in the EV business.4. GameStop plays with investorsHardcore fans of GameStop (GME) — of which there are many — rejoiced when the company posted its first profitable quarter in over two years.CEO Matt Furlong promised more cost-cutting, too, in another short earnings call.But these same folks appear to have forgotten that GameStop continues to have issues growing its sales, and that could catch up to the retailer over time, as Yahoo Finance reported. Power to the fundamental analysts.5. People chow down at the moviesStaying with the meme stocks, AMC (AMC) stock caught a bid mid-week in the wake of GameStop's better-than-expected quarter.The company's performance also caught a shout-out from CEO Adam Aron.""Learned at my weekly staff meeting that AMC set an all-time record last week for the highest-ever in our history 'Food and Beverage Revenue Per Patron,'"" Aron tweeted to his 293,000 followers.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for WBA in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.1 per share.

To keep us close to the culture and our customers, as well as to our challenges and opportunities, I intend to continue working in stores.""Be a human, not a titleStaff aren't yet convinced Narasimhan will enforce the change they want to see at the top.To get their buy-in, experts said, the CEO will need to truly listen to the issues and make sure his leadership team helps to enact change.Chris Preston is the founder and director of U.K.-based employee engagement specialists The Culture Builders and said that if Narasimhan avoids the pitfalls CEOs often fall into when it comes to culture initiatives, it could be an extremely positive idea.He explained: ""It needs to be low-key and consistent. It's can't be 'Oh my God the CEO is coming in', it just needs to be something that happens. I've seen two extremes of this: at one company there was a meeting with executives that happened once a month and had done for years, it was really relaxed. At another big pharmacy brand when the CEO came to visit it was like the Royals were in town.""Story continuesInstead of telling employees what they're doing, the C-suite needs to ""shut up and listen"" if they want to enact positive change, he added. CEOs need to be seen by their staff as humans and not titles, he added, so instead of operating from a pedestal bosses need to get to grips with the real challenges in the trenches.It was a sentiment echoed by Piers Hudson, senior director of research at global HR specialists Gartner, based in Connecticut. Hudson added: ""If it's not perceived that the CEO is actually there to listen and understand it smacks of tokenism and will lead to backfiring.""He said the CEO should be showing an interest in staff as people as opposed to employees: ""The focus of these visits should be both to help the CEO but also help people feel they've been understood.""That could be how the job fits into their life goals and broader family issues, so insuring there's enough of a focus not just on: 'How do we make coffee quicker' but asking 'How does this fit into your life? Are we protecting you if people aren't being pleasant to you?' That engagement will help it not to feel tokenistic or like the CEO is just doing it to show their face.""Value of a smiley face on cupsThe Seattle-based chain is fondly thought of not only for brightening up customers' days with hand-drawn smiley faces on the side of cups, but also for going above and beyond for visitors.In February 2022 a Texas cafe was lauded for secretly checking a female patron didn't feel threatened by an older man who was speaking to her. The note on the woman's cup from a barista read: ""Are you okay? Do you want us to intervene? If you do, take the lid off the cup.""Staff clearly care about their customers, said Preston, and to make sure they don't become disenchanted with their efforts there's a simple aim to keep in mind: solutions.Preston explained: ""We work with a lot of high-performing sports teams and athletes and they typify this idea. They never dwell on an issue for longer than two hours, they're looking at how they improve for next time. After a conversation CEOs need to have the moment where they say to staff: ""How about we ...""He said staff need to understand the ""why"" behind company decisions, whether it's why wages can't be increased, shift patterns changed or more employees hired. That understanding of a reasonable solution then needs to be communicated to the rest of a business' c-suite, Preston added, to make sure that agreements are followed through.Employees can also get more out of conversations with executives by making sure the concerns they are raising are company-wide issues backed by data, added Hudson.He explained: ""Clearly there will be a diversity of experience in a company like Starbucks but the CEO and CHRO will be trying to understand if it's a local issue or not. It's making sure you elevate the issue to something which a business has structurally created the context for and making that link.""It's then on the CEO to establish what the next steps are and when staff will hear back, he said: ""If left with no resolution it'll only feel like staff have said their piece and have been ignored.""Power of vulnerabilityUsed to being under fire from stakeholders, board members and more, CEOs can often fall into the habit of becoming defensive when faced with criticism.Being prepared and educated on issues is key to beginning potentially combative dialogue in a calm manner, added Hudson, who also encouraged CEOs to embrace their vulnerability.He explained: ""CEOs are not necessarily great at being vulnerable. They're used to being in combative conversations with investors and people who are trying to pull angles on them.""Having somebody prepping them and perhaps even rehearsing: 'These are the sort of conversations we might have' and knowing where you stand on these issues will help.""That opportunity for preparation should be extended to staff as well, Hudson said, giving staff the opportunity to ""set the agenda"".This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

For those of you interested, check out 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Dividend stocks have faced headwinds in the past given the rise in interest rates which have led to higher Treasury yields. With higher Treasury yields, capital has moved from the broader equity market into the U.S. Treasury market and the valuations of many leading dividend stocks are arguably lower than what they would have been as a result.In terms of interest rates, the Federal Reserve on March 22 raised interest rates by 25 basis points to bring the benchmark funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%.After the interest rate raise, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said, ""We believe, however, that events in the banking system over the past two weeks are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which would in turn affect economic outcomes. It is too soon to determine the extent of these effects, and therefore too soon to tell it how monetary policy should respond. As a result, we no longer state that we anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate to quell inflation. Instead, we now anticipate that some additional policy firming may be appropriate.""Story continuesWith the Federal Reserve Chairman's comments, the broader markets declined on March 22 as the market didn't like Powell's commentary on credit conditions. Recently, Deutsche Bank stock has declined on March 24 as its credit default swaps have increased. Given Deutsche Bank is a huge bank, any substantial financial difficulties Deutsche Bank faces could affect the global economy if regulators don't do enough to contain the situation.Given the economic outcomes could be negative, an economic slowdown could also negatively affect leading dividend stocks. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.chrisdorney/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 13 Best Long Term Dividend Stocks to Buy Now, we chose 13 stocks that have competitive advantages and growth potential in the long term that also pay a dividend.We ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q4.For those of you interested, check out 14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.13 Best Long Term Dividend Stocks to Buy Now13.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the company’s adjusted gross profit margin contracted 410 basis points to 36.8% due to escalated cost inflation, higher other supply-chain expenses and an adverse product mix. Also, McCormick continued to witness supply chain-related issues. The persistence of these headwinds is a worry for the quarter under review.That said, McCormick has been benefiting from its solid acquisitions and the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (“CCI”) program.  McCormick focuses on saving costs and enhancing productivity through its CCI program.On its last earnings call, MKC stated that it anticipates fiscal 2023 to witness a solid underlying business performance, backed by sales growth. It expects the Global Operating Effectiveness Program and the lapping of pandemic-led hurdles to have positively impacted fiscal 2023 operating income, which is likely to be somewhat negated by the impacts of the Kitchen Basics divestiture and a rise in employee incentive compensation costs.Management expects fiscal 2023 sales growth to be fueled by pricing actions, which, along with cost savings, is likely to help it counter inflationary headwinds.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the company’s adjusted gross profit margin contracted 410 basis points to 36.8% due to escalated cost inflation, higher other supply-chain expenses and an adverse product mix. Also, McCormick continued to witness supply chain-related issues. The persistence of these headwinds is a worry for the quarter under review.That said, McCormick has been benefiting from its solid acquisitions and the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (“CCI”) program.  McCormick focuses on saving costs and enhancing productivity through its CCI program.On its last earnings call, MKC stated that it anticipates fiscal 2023 to witness a solid underlying business performance, backed by sales growth. It expects the Global Operating Effectiveness Program and the lapping of pandemic-led hurdles to have positively impacted fiscal 2023 operating income, which is likely to be somewhat negated by the impacts of the Kitchen Basics divestiture and a rise in employee incentive compensation costs.Management expects fiscal 2023 sales growth to be fueled by pricing actions, which, along with cost savings, is likely to help it counter inflationary headwinds. The company anticipates seeing solid growth via brand strength, brand marketing, new products, category management and differentiated customer engagement. These factors bode well for the quarter under review.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for McCormick this time.

59,9964c50f-4eb4-38f1-8c5e-06c088caf155,PM,2023-03-25,7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks to Compete Against Rising Yields,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-high-yield-dividend-stocks-182018859.html,1679422818,STORY,"['ICL.TA', 'PM', 'BHP', 'PFE', 'PSX', 'RIO']","[Although passive income has always been a strong component of a well-balanced portfolio, investors may want to pay particular attention to high-yield dividend stocks to buy. Should the Federal Reserve continue to move forward with its interest rate hikes, bond yields will rise. In turn, securities that can’t keep pace with a higher dividend yield may suffer the consequences.Indeed, one of the problematic circumstances associated with the Fed’s otherwise noble efforts in containing inflation centers on the competition. Unless you anticipate the U.S. government defaulting on its obligations, its debt securities practically represent zero-risk investments. Of course, when zero-risk investments offer a superior yield to equities, that becomes a serious dilemma. To help mitigate this dynamic, those that want to stay in the market should consider the below high-yield dividend stocks to buy.PFEPfizer$40.63PSXPhillips 66$96.37PMPhilip Morris$95.75BHPBHP Group$58.09RIORio Tinto$74.54ICLICL Group$6.67IIPRInnovative Industrial Properties$79.95InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPfizer (PFE)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comOne of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) obviously played a major role in addressing the Covid-19 crisis. However, with pandemic-related fears subsiding quickly, the shifting framework boded poorly for PFE stock. Since the start of the new year, PFE gave up nearly 22% of its equity value. Over the trailing year, it’s down 26%.Nevertheless, it might not be the wisest idea to abandon a generally solid enterprise. For instance, Pfizer carries an Altman Z-Score of 3.4, indicating fiscal resilience. As well, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio comes in at 0.85 times, favorably below the sector median of 1.74 times. Operationally, Pfizer benefits from an excellent three-year revenue growth rate of 34.4%. Also, it’s very much profitable with a net margin of 31.27%.Story continuesFor passive income, Pfizer carries a forward yield of 4.09%. Its payout ratio is on the low side at 42.3%. Also, it features 12 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Therefore, it makes for an intriguing case for high-yield dividend stocks to buy.Phillips 66 (PSX)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA hydrocarbon energy firm, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) specializes in the downstream component of the energy value chain. This arena involves refining and marketing. To be fair, the new year hasn’t treated PSX stock all that well. In addition, some of the banking jitters impacted sentiment in other areas. Since the January opener, PSX dipped over 6%.Nevertheless, it could rank among the high-yield dividend stocks to buy. Fundamentally, the normalization of society (i.e. workers returning to the office) should benefit downstream energy specialists. Financially, Phillips 66 offers several enticing attributes. For instance, its Altman Z-Score of 4.07 indicates a stable business. Operationally, its revenue growth rate of 14.9% and EBITDA growth rate of 39.3% during the past three years bolsters confidence. For passive income, the energy firm carries a forward yield of 4.43%. Moreover, its payout ratio sits at 32.04%, providing confidence regarding yield sustainability.Philip Morris (PM)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comAs one of the world’s biggest tobacco firms, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) invariably carries a controversial profile. For those willing to overlook that angle, another challenge exists: global smoking rates have declined over the past several years. From this perspective, it may not be surprising that PM went volatile in 2023. Since the Jan. opener, PM fell more than 6%.Still, it could stand among the high-yield dividend stocks to buy because the business isn’t completely irrelevant. Should economic hardships materialize, it might be possible that global smoking rates rise due to the stress relief phenomenon. Also, Philip Morris offers heated tobacco products – essentially e-cigarettes or vaporizers – that offer a popular alternative to “analog” products. In addition, Philip Morris offers a stable balance sheet (with an Altman Z-Score of 3.1). As well, it’s a richly profitable enterprise with a net margin of 28.49%.Regarding passive rewards for shareholders, the company offers a forward yield of 5.36%. While its payout ratio stands a bit on the high side at 73.92%, it features 14 years of consecutive annual dividend increases.BHP Group (BHP)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockA metals and mining firm, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) represents an intriguing take for high-yield dividend stocks. That’s because the company produces some of the hottest demand commodities in the modern world. This includes copper, iron ore, nickel, and potash. Indeed, as global economies compete in relevant sectors such as electric vehicles, securing critical resources may carry a hefty premium.Admittedly, though, the market appears a little slow in recognizing the forward outlook for BHP and its ilk. Since the January opener, shares stumbled over 6%. However, investors should look to BHP’s financials for confidence. In particular, the company owns a solid balance sheet (with an Altman Z-Score of 5.44).Also, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 14.2% and its net margin comes in at nearly 46%. Both stats rank in the upper half for the mining industry. To boot, the market prices BHP at a forward multiple of only 9.09, making it undervalued. Turning to passive income, BHP offers a forward yield of 6.25%. Its payout ratio is a tad on the high side at 63.51% but it’s relatively workable.Rio Tinto (RIO)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockBilled as a leading global mining group, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) also offers a relevant take on high-yield dividend stocks. In particular, it could play a significant role in EVs. With its specialty in copper and lithium mining, Rio basically serves the infrastructural needs of individual EV brands. Further, while it’s impossible to know which brand will win out decades from today, it’s a safe bet every automaker will require gobs of lithium.Therefore, I’m not terribly concerned about the 9% loss in RIO on a year-to-date basis. Don’t get me wrong – I’m not dismissing it. However, the longer-term implications offer an extremely attractive profile for this mining enterprise.Additionally, the company brings solid financials to the table. Its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 11.7%, while its net margin blows most competitors out of the water at 22.31%. It’s also undervalued against both trailing and forward earnings. For passive income, Rio carries a forward yield of 6.96%. As with BHP Group above, its payout ratio is a bit high at 66.63%. Still, it’s relatively workable.ICL Group (ICL)dividend stocks ceSource: ShutterstockHeading into the riskier side of high-yield dividend stocks to buy, ICL Group (NYSE:ICL) represents a multinational manufacturing concern that develops, produces, and markets fertilizers, metals, and other special-purpose chemical products. Because of the tough economic environment along with the recent banking sector jitters, ICL hasn’t performed well recently. Since the start of the new year, ICL fell over 9%.That’s not all. In the past 365 days, ICL gave up nearly 44% of its equity value. Still, those willing to accept some risk in their high-yield dividend stocks may have a compelling opportunity here. Specifically, ICL enjoys very strong financials. In addition to its stable balance sheet, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 23.6%. Also, it’s highly profitable with a net margin of 21.56%.Also, it’s undervalued, trading at a trailing multiple of 3.98. In contrast, the sector median value is 12.16 times. Regarding rewards for shareholders, ICL’s forward yield comes out to 8.38%. The tradeoff is that its payout ratio is high at 78.31%. Still, for sensible speculation, ICL may attract the right investor.Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockTied tangentially to the cannabis industry, Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR) represents a leading provider of real estate capital for the underlying “green” industry. To be clear, Innovative itself isn’t a cannabis grower. Rather, it helps enterprises that focus on this particular subsegment of the agricultural industry find success.Unfortunately, the market itself generates controversy for obvious reasons. As well, legal vagaries between federal and state laws stymie forward progress. Therefore, IIPR rates as an extremely volatile example of high-yield dividend stocks. Since the start of the year, it’s down over 18%. In the trailing year, it lost over 59% of its equity value – a hefty figure.While troubled, prospective speculators should note that Innovative features a cash-rich balance sheet. Also, its operations are on fire (in a good way). Its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 33.7% while its net margin stands at nearly 56%. Finally, Innovative features a forward yield of 8.97%. The one drawback here is that its payout ratio pings at 126.39%. Therefore, sustainability will be a concern, making IIPR appropriate for speculators.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The company offers the most diversified refinery base in the industry, with a capacity of 3.2 million barrels per day in its 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean.Importantly, Valero is best placed to reap profits from solid refining margins, mainly owing to the strategic refinery structure that enables it to use cheaper oil for more than half of its needs. The majority of Valero’s refining plants are located in the Gulf Coast area, from where there is easy access to the export facilities.The Gulf Coast presence helped Valero expand export volumes over the past years and gain from high distillate margins.

EEFT recently announced that its subsidiary, Ria Money Transfer, agreed to be an official sponsor of FC Internazionale Milano, the famous Italian football club commonly known as Inter Milan. The deal is likely to continue through the 2025 season.The sports sponsorship is expected to boost Euronet’s Ria brand’s awareness internationally, which will benefit the company’s Money Transfer segment. This unit encompasses Xe, Dandelion and Ria Money Transfer businesses. The deal is expected to be crucial for Euronet as Inter Milan has a fanbase of more than 500 million around the globe.Ria has a presence in more than 180 countries and territories, making it a perfect fit for the football club. The move from Euronet is a prudent one, given the fact that the global remittance market is expected to grow rapidly in the coming days. Its Money Transfer segment accounted for 42% of its total revenues in 2022. The company has also been expanding its digital presence and bolstering its remittance service capabilities.Payments technology juggernaut Visa Inc. V recently revealed in its “Money Travels: 2023 Digital Remittances Adoption” research report that digital remittances are becoming the most sought-after method of payments internationally. This is expected to create huge opportunities for companies providing money transfer services like Euronet, MoneyGram International, Inc. MGI and The Western Union Company WU.The certainty and security of digital transactions is expected to drive the demand for digital remittances. While traditional modes of money transfer expose one to unexpected delays and higher fees charged by banks, the digital option makes the process more seamless and secure.Given the stiff competition prevalent in the U.S. market, MoneyGram is focusing on diversifying its revenue mix geographically to align with the global remittance market growth and pursue higher-margin corridors.

62,413c5e13-aff8-368f-9127-ee78a31bd5db,SPG,2023-03-25,4 Dividend Stocks to Avoid — and 3 to Buy Instead,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-dividend-stocks-avoid-3-170132173.html,1679418092,STORY,"['BAC', 'SIVB', 'KRC', 'WFC', 'SPG', 'KEY']","[The conversation surrounding which dividend stocks to buy and which to avoid centers on a wobbly economy. The failures of banks including Silvergate Capital (NYSE:SI), Silicon Valley Bank (NASDAQ:SIVB), and Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY) sent shockwaves rippling through the financial system. As a result, the potential for a financial crisis a-la 2008/2009 remains high. The FDIC has stepped in, and things appear calm, for the moment.The FDIC has implicitly guaranteed all uninsured deposits. That effectively subverts risk altogether which has caused multiple banks teetering on the brink of failure to rebound. However, I’d avoid the weakest large and regional banks.Further, there are other economic issues afoot. Consumer spending remains volatile, as does commercial real estate. Dividend stocks in those sectors are highly risky currently.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat said, the strongest big banks look like good opportunities as customers flock to safety.WFCWells Fargo$38.52KEYKeyCorp$12.70SPGSimon Property Group$109.83KRCKilroy Realty Corp.$30.71PMPhilip Morris$95.58BACBank of America$28.78JPMJPMorgan Chase$130.89Wells Fargo (WFC)Wells Fargo (WFC) bank sign in yellow and red with wagon logo. The sign is flanked by tall grassSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is one of the largest banks in the U.S., boasting a market capitalization of around $145 billion. By some logic, Wells Fargo should be among the dividend stocks in a favorable position right now, as big banks appear to be bastions of safety relative to their regional peers.The fact that Wells Fargo is among 4 banks that made $5 billion uninsured deposits each into First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) seems to strengthen that sentiment: It’s strong enough to contribute and act as an anchor for the overall banking system.But despite Wells Fargo’s size and reputation due to that scale, there are lots of things not to like. Wells Fargo shouldn’t be judged currently solely based on its past transgressions. The firm’s fake account scandal is likely a thing of the past, even as it garners headlines in court recently.Story continuesBut I do question whether a firm that set sales goals so high that workers were compelled to create fake accounts, is suddenly so different. Wells Fargo continues to have a less-than-stellar reputation, and it wouldn’t be surprising for material weaknesses to emerge again soon.KeyCorp (KEY)a Keybank buildingSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comKeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) is a regional bank stock that was already facing trouble before regional banks were under such pointed scrutiny. Yes, like all banks, KeyCorp appears to be ‘safe’ following the FDIC interceding. But while that will temporarily prop it up, I still believe it’s a dividend stock to avoid.The primary reason, outside of unknown instabilities, is its weak performance of late. In the fourth quarter, KeyCorp did not perform strongly. Earnings were below the low end of analysts’ expectations.KeyCorp had interest rates on its side. The Federal Reserve pushed rates aggressively higher in 2022. That’s generally a boon to banks that benefit from higher interest income due to those higher rates. KeyCorp was no different, with $1.227 billion in net interest income in Q4, up 18.2%.But it wasn’t enough. Total revenues fell 2.5% during the period. The overall effect here is simple: KEY stock could still have serious underlying issues that the FDIC can’t glaze over. And given Q4 performance was so weak, this doesn’t bode well for shareholders in the wake of so much market instability.Simon Property Group (SPG)building facade of simon property group (SPG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comSimon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) is a retail REIT that certainly is among the higher-yielding dividend stocks in the market, with a current yield of roughly 6.9%.Many times, such high yields are enough to entice investors to investing their capital in these stocks. At the same, high yields correlate to greater risk, scaring capital away. I would suggest avoiding Simon Property Group, primarily because the company’s portfolio is heading into weakness.The company leases malls and outlets along with mills. The reason to avoid SPG stock is simple: retail sales fell in February, signaling an increasingly weaker consumer. That weaker consumer, in turn, is less-likely to frequent Simon Property Group’s sites. That could lead to businesses in those malls and outlets shutting down, lowering revenues and increasing stress.Lease income increased very slightly in 2022 for the company. Losses, however, grew from $8.01 million to $61.2 million. Thus, it’s probably best to stick with lower-risk dividend stocks as retail should weaken further.Kilroy Realty Corp. (KRC)a person in a suit holds a tiny house to represent reits to buySource: ShutterstockLike SPG stock, Kilroy Realty Corp (NYSE:KRC) is a high-yield dividend REIT. And like SPG, Kilroy Realty Group is facing substantial headwinds. However, Kilroy Realty Group operates in the office REIT sector, so its difficulties differ from those in the retail sector.In particular, Kilroy Realty looks suspect due to the geography of its holdings. Its portfolio includes substantial holdings in San Francisco and San Diego. San Francisco is of course home to Silicon Valley and the tech center of the U.S. It’s no secret that the region and industry are undergoing serious volatility at present. Layoffs in the tech sector are likely to continue at a rapid pace. Additionally, Silicon Valley Bank was the epicenter of banking failures that promised to burn through the banking system, had the FDIC not interceded.There are too many unknowns right now to invest in KRC stock. Office REITs are facing serious issues as companies and employees battle over work-from-home return-to-office dynamics.Philip Morris (PM)An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.Source: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.comSwitching gears, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) is a dividend stock investors should consider. Like other dividend stocks on this list, PM stock also offers a reasonably high 5.3% yield, nearer the higher end of the safe spectrum. I keep writing about Phillip Morris because I want investors to see what a strong opportunity it represents. Cigarette smoking is out of fashion, but Phillip Morris is in a strong position to fill the void.The firm’s IQOS vape brand is one reason analysts like PM stock. Overall, smoke-free products currently account for nearly one-third of company revenues. That truth is part of the reason to preference Phillip Morris over other big tobacco stocks. Its competitors are having a more difficult time pivoting away from cigarettes as a revenue source. Yet, cigarette sales continue to trend downward as smoking has lost favor. That puts Phillip Morris in prime position.The company acquired Swedish Match late last year. The snus and nicotine pouch manufacturer has grown even faster than the company overall and should help the firm push its lead further ahead of lagging competitors.Bank of America (BAC)As It Tests Support, Bank of America Stock Provides a Trading OpportunitySource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comBank of America (NYSE:BAC) may continue to be among the winners, as far as dividend stocks in the banking sector are concerned, over the next few weeks. Bank of America is among the better-regarded of the large banks, meaning it will benefit for some time. Dividend investors should also know that BAC’s 3.2% dividend yield sits right in the sweet spot of providing enough income, without excessive risk.Bank of America was one of those four banks mentioned above that deposited $5 billion into First Republic Bank to shore up its reserves. That’s a clear sign of its position as one of the most important pillars of the banking system. In fact, it’s the second-largest bank in the U.S., behind the last stock below.If you have any confidence in the U.S. banking system, Bank of America is a clear choice right now.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)A sign for JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM).Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.comA recent article in Barron’s pointed out the advantages JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock offers following the recent meltdown. That article pointed to the company’s strong balance as an overarching reason it looks so appealing now. It’s the largest bank and has much stronger reserves than others. That’s especially true when compared to banks that recently fell.The last financial crisis cemented new rules that mean big banks are better capitalized than they previously were. Regulations on smaller banks were rolled back recently, however. That certainly contributed to the meltdown, sure. But it also makes the big banks look extra safe at this moment. And that’s going to benefit the #1 and #2 banks for some time.The overarching idea is that JPMorgan has an excellent opportunity to increase its leading position right now. We’ve all read and heard about depositors flocking to Chase bank to put their money where it’s safest. That is going to allow the company to grow in ways it couldn’t have expected just a week ago.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Goldman Sachs in FocusBased in New York, Goldman Sachs (GS) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -8.31%. The investment bank is currently shelling out a dividend of $2.5 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.18%. This compares to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.5% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.81%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $10 is up 11.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, Goldman Sachs has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 29.39%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Goldman's current payout ratio is 33%, meaning it paid out 33% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, GS expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $33.14 per share, with earnings expected to increase 10.25% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, GS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

66,911ec0df-295b-4f02-916c-b9b08b9a49a9,GS,2023-03-25,Goldman Sachs: Should it be punished for its role in the Silicon Valley Bank debacle?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-should-it-be-punished-for-its-role-in-the-silicon-valley-bank-debacle-140455869.html,1679666695,STORY,['GS'],"[We journalists usually write articles about how problems like how the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) happened. But because so much has been written about SVB since it became the second-biggest bank failure in U.S. history two weeks ago, I’d like to depart from form.Instead of chewing over the SVB’s collapse, I’d like to make some suggestions that I think could help forestall future SVB-like problems by instilling in Wall Street the fear of making unseemly profits on the financial distress of others.As part of this, I’d like to suggest a non-traditional and constructive approach for our political leaders to take during public hearings next week examining the role that Goldman Sachs (GS) played in the collapse of SVB. There’s no date set for those hearings, but you can be sure that we’ll have them.Rather than use the upcoming U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearings to posture and make speeches, which are Congressional specialties, it would be great if the people running the show use them to extract the information from Goldman that will allow us to figure out how much money Goldman made by buying $24 billion of securities from SVB at a below-market price.And then to demand that Goldman turn over that profit to the federal government as compensation for the financial damage caused by SVB’s collapse and the subsequent aftereffects.You can be sure that if that happened, Wall Street firms would hesitate before taking massive advantage of Main Street firms that are in financial distress and in need of financing and good advice, as SVB was.Here’s the deal, based on my reading of documents, conversations with knowledgeable people who declined to talk on the record and more than 50 years of parsing numbers and explaining them in what I call “a language approaching English.”SVB, which had foolishly loaded its balance sheet with long-term federal government securities yielding less than 2% back when interest rates were mega-low, needed to convert those securities to cash to try to avoid a credit downgrade from Moody’s and to raise cash to pay off depositors who were starting to take their money out of the bank.Story continuesOn March 8, SVB ended up getting about $21.5 billion from Goldman for securities that were valued at about $24 billion on its books. The bank took a $2.5 billion loss on the sale. But it painted the most optimistic picture of the deal, stressing that its loss was $1.8 billion after taxes, a number that you see a lot, rather than $2.5 billion, a number that you rarely if ever see.The securities were selling for less than SVB paid for them because their average yield was fixed at a pathetic 1.79% and the yield on 10-year Treasury securities was about 3.8%. This meant that SVB’s 1.79% securities were valued in the financial markets at less than face value.Did Goldman Sachs dole out bad advice to Silicon Valley Bank? And if so, profit from it? A Goldman exec at the firm's investor day in NYC in February. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidHowever, because of bookkeeping rules, SVB was carrying its portfolio of so-called “available for sale” securities at cost, not at their market value. That’s why the $1.8 billion loss that SVB announced on the sale of the securities to Goldman came as a shock to SVB depositors and was a key element in starting a massive deposit outflow that caused the FDIC to take over the bank.That takeover, combined with the failure of Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank, both of which specialized in what I call “craptocurrency” (and most people call cryptocurrency), threatened to turn into a total financial panic. That prompted the federal government to say that all deposits in three banks were fully guaranteed, not just those up to the $250,000 limit.Goldman profited in two ways from its purchase of SVB’s securities.First, because it was one of the few buyers capable of cutting a check of $21.5 billion in an overnight transaction, it got to buy the $24 billion of securities for less than their market price because it was dealing with a desperate seller that was in a big hurry.It’s not clear how big that discount was. The number that emanates from Goldman is 0.26%—which works out to something in the $50 million to $60 million range. If the right questions get asked by lawmakers, we’ll be able to get the right number.Now, for the second source of profit. With interest rates falling as the result of the turmoil in financial markets, the market prices of the securities Goldman bought from SVB rose. Goldman’s intention was to sell most (if not all) of the SVB securities as quickly as possible, but we don’t know how many of those securities it sold or at what prices. Again, if the right questions are asked, we can find out Goldman’s profit on that part of the deal, too.Then there’s a whole other, complicated question of whether it was SVB’s managers or Goldman that screwed up the timing and that precipitated the announcement of the $1.8 billion loss before Goldman had lined up buyers for $2.25 billion of new SVB stock. That announcement touched off the bank run that led the FDIC and the state of California to close SVB.We need to know if SVB came to Goldman saying that it wanted to sell it the “assets for sale” and to also raise new capital to offset its losses, or whether Goldman suggested the securities sale and capital raising as a package deal.Customers line up outside of the Silicon Valley Bank headquarters, waiting to speak with representatives, in Santa Clara, California, U.S., March 13, 2023. REUTERS/Brittany Hosea-SmallWhy does this matter? Because if SVB had raised the $2.25 billion of capital that it was seeking before it did the asset sale and announced its $1.8 billion after-tax loss, depositors would have had nothing to be frightened about and we’d probably be talking about SVB in the current tense, not the past tense.But announcing the loss, combined with SVB CEO Greg Becker announcing that the bank was seeking to sell $2.25 billion of new stock and urging the bank’s depositors not to worry, made it impossible to raise the capital and doomed the bank.If the timing of the asset sale and the failed capital sale is SVB's fault, then we can’t blame Goldman for SVB’s collapse. However, if SVB came to Goldman for advice and Goldman advised it to sell assets and raise capital, then doing the asset sale and disclosing the loss before raising the capital is the fault of bad advice from Goldman.It would be great if lawmakers use the upcoming hearings to find out how much the government should seek to claw back from Goldman on the money it made on the assets it purchased from SVB. It would be even greater if in addition to that, we could find out whether to blame Goldman or SVB’s managers about the terrible timing of SVB announcing a big loss on the asset sale to Goldman before lining up investors to buy the $2.25 billion of new SVB stock the bank wanted to sell.Will either of these things happen? It seems unlikely—but we can always hope.Allan Sloan, who has written about business for more than 50 years, is a seven-time winner of the Gerald Loeb Award, business journalism’s highest honor.

As the U.S. government steps in to guarantee the deposits at now defunct Silicon Valley Bank, and the largest banks in America inject $30 billion of deposits into troubled lender First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC), investors have been understandably rattled and moved their money out of bank stocks. However, by most accounts, the selloff of bank stocks has been an overreaction. By nearly all accounts, this is not a repeat of the 2008-09 financial crisis. The good news for long-term investors is that many rock-solid bank stocks are now on sale as their share prices have been pushed lower in recent weeks. Here are seven bank stocks to buy on the dip.JPMJPMorgan$127.18GSGoldman Sachs$313.67HSBCHSBC$34.30WFCWells Fargo$37.20BACBank of America$27.64USBUS Bancorp$34.79PNCPNC Financial$124.40JPMorgan Chase (JPM)JPM stock: the JPMorgan logo on top of a buildingSource: ShutterstockLet’s begin with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), which remains the largest U.S. bank by market capitalization. Few banks are as solid today as JPMorgan Chase. Many analysts refer to the lender as having a “fortress balance sheet.” And despite the turmoil of financial markets over the past year, JPMorgan Chase has found a way to continue reporting strong quarterly earnings. The bank’s profit for the fourth and final quarter of 2022 was $11 billion, or $3.57 per share, compared with $10.4 billion, or $3.33 per share, during the same period a year earlier.The revenue of JPMorgan’s investment-banking unit continued to decline in Q4 due to a lack of deals caused by the stock market’s struggles. The investment banking unit’s revenue declined 57% year-over-year last quarter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStory continuesHowever, the lender’s trading revenue grew amid the market volatility as investors repositioned their portfolios to navigate the current high interest-rate environment. Moreover, the bank’s revenue from fixed income trading rose 12% YOY in Q2, .It should come as no surprise that JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is reportedly advising First Republic Bank on its recovery plan given the clout that JPM and its management team have in the global banking sector.Goldman Sachs (GS)In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the backgroundSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comGoldman Sachs’ (NYSE:GS) consumer banking unit, called “Marcus,” got off to a promising start in 2016, but it was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and never recovered. Goldman ultimately lost $3 billion on Marcus, which was rolled into a “platform solutions business” before being shut down and leaving the Wall Street titan with a rare black eye.However, there is every reason to believe that Goldman Sachs will bounce back and return to its winning ways, making it one of the best  bank stocks to buy on the dip. The company has taken decisive steps to right its ship, including cutting more than 3,000 jobs and slashing its annual bonus payments to bankers by 40%.The layoffs have been concentrated in Goldman’s investment banking division, whose corporate deal making has meaningfully slowed over the last year. The bank’s CEO, David Solomon, has said that he will refocus the investment bank on what it does best: making money for corporate clients.HSBC Holdings (HSBC)HSBC logo on corporate buildingSource: ShutterstockInvestors looking for a solid foreign bank outside the U.S. should consider HSBC Bank (NYSE:HSBC). The lender, which began life in Hong Kong and primarily served Asian markets is today based in London and is increasingly focusing on Europe while also trying to break into North America.In fact, HSBC is now the biggest bank in Europe with more than $10 trillion of assets under custody.  While HSBC recently announced that it was exiting Canada after a failed foray into that market, the sale of its Canadian unit will result in a special one-time dividend payment of 21 cents per share to its stockholders.HSBC announced the special dividend payment along with strong fourth-quarter results that showed a profit of $5.2 billion, which was 108% higher than the $2.5 billion of net income that  the bank had recorded a year earlier, and higher than the $4.97 billion that analysts who cover the lender had, on average, expected.Due to the strong Q4 print, HSBC announced a regular dividend payment to shareholders of 40 cents per share, which equates to a yield of 4.72% and is among the highest of any bank.Wells Fargo (WFC)Wells Fargo (WFC) bank sign in yellow and red with wagon logo. The sign is flanked by tall grassSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comU.S. lender Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) made headlines at the start of this year when it announced that it was exiting the multitrillion-dollar U.S. mortgage market. The announcement was a shock given that Wells Fargo was a leader in the U.S. home loan market, managing as much as $201.8 billion of such loans, according to data from Inside Mortgage Finance.The lender said it was getting out of the real estate game due to a combination of onerous regulations and rising interest rates that have dampened the market over the last year.Going forward, Wells Fargo plans to focus exclusively on providing home loans for its rich clients of its wealth-management unit.Additionally, the lender said it was generating more of its revenue from investment banking and credit cards rather than from mortgages and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). While a surprise, Wells Fargo’s exit from the real estate market is not unprecedented. That’s because JPMorgan Chase got out of the mortgage market after the 2008 financial crisis.Wells Fargo announced its exit from the housing sector as it reported disappointing Q$ earnings in January.Bank of America (BAC)bank of america stockSource: PL Gould / Shutterstock.comAnother U.S. lender that is viewed as stable and strong today is Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). The second biggest bank in the U.S. after JPMorgan Chase has come along way since the dark days of the 2008 financial crisis. Between late 2007 and mid-2009, BAC stock declined more than 80%, and, at one point, was trading for just $6 a share and in danger of becoming a penny stock. Fortunately, Bank of America weathered the storm and even purchased financial firm Merrill Lynch coming out of the crisis and is today much healthier than in the past.Along with JPMorgan, Bank of America helped to organize the group of 11 banks that agreed to deposit $30 billion in troubled lender First Republic to help shore-up its finances and rally confidence in the banking sector. Bank of America is thriving under the leadership of CEO Brian Moynihan, who has the lender focused on consumer banking and loans. That strategy helped Bank of America post a Q4 2022 earnings beat despite a sharp downturn in investment banking revenues. BAC stock is down 15% on the year and a definite buy at current levels.US Bancorp (USB)US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is not quite as well known as the four largest lenders in America. However, US Bancorp is the fifth biggest bank in the U.S. based in assets despite being primarily based in the Midwest. Maybe it’s because of its roots in the American heartland, but U.S. Bancorp has largely avoided scandal throughout its nearly 100 years of existence. And many analysts single the bank out for being one of the best managed financial institutions in the country.In particular, bullish analysts point out that US Bancorp has low-cost deposits that other banks can’t match, and more than enough funds on hand to cover potential loan losses. The bank also has limited exposure to troubled foreign lenders such as Credit Suisse.One of US Bancorp’s fans is none other than famed investor Warren Buffett. While he has sold most of his bank stocks in recent years, Buffett continues to own more than 8 million shares of USB stock, worth more than $300 million.PNC Financial Services (PNC)An image of a solar panel in the shape of a piggy bank on a rooftop; concept for solar stocksSource: Andreas Prott / ShutterstockAlso among the 10 biggest U.S. banks with more than $500 billion of assets is PNC Financial Services (NYSE:PNC). Like other lenders, PNC stock has been dragged lower by the current banking troubles and investors’ shaky sentiment. However, by all accounts, PNC Financial remains a sturdy bank that has none of the underlying problems that plagued a number of regional banks in recent weeks. In fact, there were rumors that PNC Financial was going to try to buy Silicon Valley Bank following its collapse. But the bank has ruled out that scenario.The decision to steer clear of Silicon Valley Bank could be a smart one given the financial mess at that institution. PNC’s revenue grew 4% in the final quarter of last year versus the same period a year earlier to $5.76 billion.During Q4, the company also $1.2 billion to shareholders through its generous dividend that pays $1.50 per share each quarter for a yield of 4.55%. Like its peers, PNC stock has been dragged lower due to the current turmoil of the financial sector.As the first quarter nears its end, PNC Financial’s stock is down 21%. Investors should view the decline as a buying opportunity.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in BAC.

69,482f15d2-ab40-35d7-9a79-ab07e8fd41b0,HOLX,2023-03-25,Catalent (CTLT) Inks Deal for Nasal Spray for Opioid Overdoses,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/catalent-ctlt-inks-deal-nasal-151603319.html,1679670963,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Catalent, Inc. CTLT signed a commercial supply agreement with Harm Reduction Therapeutics. Per the agreement terms, Catalent will manufacture Harm Reduction Therapeutics’ naloxone nasal spray, RiVive (3.0 mg), for the emergency treatment of known or suspected cases of opioid overdose.Harm Reduction Therapeutics is a 501(c)(3) non-profit pharmaceutical company, which aims to prevent opioid overdose deaths by making low-cost naloxone available to everyone.Catalent expects the FDA’s approval for RiVive in July 2023 and the U.S. launch in early 2024.The latest deal is likely to significantly solidify Catalent’s Inhalation Strategy business.Rationale Behind the AgreementThe commercial supply agreement follows the FDA’s grant of Priority Review status to Harm Reduction Therapeutics in December 2022 for its over-the-counter (OTC) naloxone nasal spray, New Drug Application. Naloxone, which is a safe and effective opioid antagonist, was originally approved by the FDA in 1971. Since then, it has been used extensively by medical professionals and the general public to effectively reverse opioid overdoses. However, access to existing naloxone nasal sprays is currently limited to behind-the-counter pharmacy distribution via a prescriber or a Health Department’s standing order.Per Catalent’s management, the agreement with Harm Reduction Therapeutics is a significant step forward in tackling a major national public health issue, which will likely enable it to be part of a potentially life-changing program.Harm Reduction Therapeutics’ management believes that amid the ongoing national tragedy of the opioid epidemic and for OTC naloxone to address this unmet need, the company’s need for a manufacturing partner with the capability to help make naloxone more widely and easily accessible to save lives will likely be met. These lives would otherwise be lost to opioid overdose.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Coherent Market Insights published on GlobeNewswire, the global naloxone market was estimated to be $1,118.3 million in 2022 and is anticipated to see a CAGR of 10.4% between 2022 and 2030. Factors like the increasing prevalence of opioid overdoses and favorable reimbursements for naloxone products are expected to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the latest agreement seems to have been timed well.Recent AgreementsThis month, Catalent announced a licensing agreement with Bhami Research Laboratory (BRL). The deal is expected to provide Catalent with access to BRL’s formulation technology to help enable the subcutaneous delivery of high-concentration biologic therapies.The same month, Catalent announced its successful formulation design and clinical-phase manufacturing collaboration with Grünenthal for an orally dosed small molecule in the latter’s pipeline.

70,71530d68-c8a6-34bf-83a9-763f9d280f27,HOLX,2023-03-25,"Here is What to Know Beyond Why Hologic, Inc. (HOLX) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-hologic-inc-130001959.html,1679662801,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this medical device maker have returned -3.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, which Hologic falls in, has gained 0.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.88 per share, indicating a change of -57.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.74 points to a change of -37.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.99 indicates a change of +6.7% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Hologic.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for HOLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Hologic, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $967.05 million indicates a year-over-year change of -32.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.97 billion and $4.13 billion estimates indicate -18.4% and +4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $1.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -27%. EPS of $1.07 for the same period compares with $2.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $980.98 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.5%. The EPS surprise was +18.89%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session.

The streaming giant is also expanding games portfolio in order to keep subscribers engaged.This internet video service is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.81 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -20.4%.

Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal joins us for more. Hey, Allie.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hi, Rachelle. And that's right, Netflix leading the S&amp;P 500 on Thursday, with shares closing more than 9% higher after a big rally that we saw in the stock. Shares leveling out a bit today, up about 1.4%, but still trading to the upside following those huge gains.It was not immediately clear what was driving this rally yesterday. But it all seems to stem back to positive data surrounding the company's password sharing crackdown in Canada. And according to [INAUDIBLE] Data, that crackdown did not have a material impact on churn. In fact, gross additions in Canada actually improved.Wells Fargo out with some new estimates following that report, saying if Netflix added 10 million extra Canadian members at an additional $8 a month plus 5 million additions at $15 a month, that would lead to a $2 billion upside in revenue at the high margin, which is what Netflix wanted. They really wanted to improve that top line number, improve profitability.In addition to that password sharing crackdown, we've also seen recent reports that their ad-supported tier is doing really well. Bloomberg reporting earlier this week that the ad tier reached roughly 1 million monthly active users in the US in those first two months, bucking earlier reports that the ad tier was actually struggling. So that's been positive.The fact that we've seen a lot of analysts on Wall Street reiterating their buy ratings or outperform ratings, encouraging investors to jump into the stock, has also led to some momentum, in addition to the fact that Netflix seems to really be doubling down on its gaming strategy.Story continuesSo once again, just multiple revenue initiatives here. And all of that really helping sentiment heading into the next earnings season. Netflix will report Q1 earnings on April 18. So hopefully some more details surrounding all of these strategy plays and more specifics on how Netflix thinks all of this could play out and help the stock in the future.RACHELLE AKUFFO: It's interesting to see how low that churn is because social media was sort of all ablaze as to what would happen, people saying they would quit Netflix. It doesn't seem to be the case, at least for Canada for right now.And Allie, there's also some news from the FTC that they've proposed a rule that would make it easier for consumers to cancel free subscriptions. What more can you tell us about that?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, so the FTC proposing this new regulation which essentially would ban companies which use deceptive, lengthy, cumbersome measures to have users cancel a subscription. We all have been there. I know personally for me, I've been offered three months of free Apple TV+ with my phone subscription. But I know in the back of my head, I'm going to forget that's there. And then they will keep charging me for that.So essentially with this new ruling, customers will be able to cancel the same way that they signed up for a particular service. And look, streaming obviously affected by that, with all of the major companies that we have, so many options on the market. We know this has been a frustrating point for consumers, a pain point for consumers moving forward.So perhaps this is one way that customers can really address this head-on and not have to deal with lots and lots of fees over time because we know that the industry is heading in a place where we're going to see some consolidation. Consumers are already being more picky, more choosy in the services and the platforms that they choose to subscribe to. So I think this is another development in that process and how we're going to see a more picky consumer moving forward.RACHELLE AKUFFO: It certainly does keep evolving, this space. I usually just do the calendar reminder. But I've been caught out plenty of times with those free subscriptions as well.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes.RACHELLE AKUFFO: A big thank-you there, Allie Canal. Thanks so much.]"

79,9964c50f-4eb4-38f1-8c5e-06c088caf155,PSX,2023-03-25,7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks to Compete Against Rising Yields,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-high-yield-dividend-stocks-182018859.html,1679422818,STORY,"['ICL.TA', 'PM', 'BHP', 'PFE', 'PSX', 'RIO']","[Although passive income has always been a strong component of a well-balanced portfolio, investors may want to pay particular attention to high-yield dividend stocks to buy. Should the Federal Reserve continue to move forward with its interest rate hikes, bond yields will rise. In turn, securities that can’t keep pace with a higher dividend yield may suffer the consequences.Indeed, one of the problematic circumstances associated with the Fed’s otherwise noble efforts in containing inflation centers on the competition. Unless you anticipate the U.S. government defaulting on its obligations, its debt securities practically represent zero-risk investments. Of course, when zero-risk investments offer a superior yield to equities, that becomes a serious dilemma. To help mitigate this dynamic, those that want to stay in the market should consider the below high-yield dividend stocks to buy.PFEPfizer$40.63PSXPhillips 66$96.37PMPhilip Morris$95.75BHPBHP Group$58.09RIORio Tinto$74.54ICLICL Group$6.67IIPRInnovative Industrial Properties$79.95InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPfizer (PFE)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comOne of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) obviously played a major role in addressing the Covid-19 crisis. However, with pandemic-related fears subsiding quickly, the shifting framework boded poorly for PFE stock. Since the start of the new year, PFE gave up nearly 22% of its equity value. Over the trailing year, it’s down 26%.Nevertheless, it might not be the wisest idea to abandon a generally solid enterprise. For instance, Pfizer carries an Altman Z-Score of 3.4, indicating fiscal resilience. As well, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio comes in at 0.85 times, favorably below the sector median of 1.74 times. Operationally, Pfizer benefits from an excellent three-year revenue growth rate of 34.4%. Also, it’s very much profitable with a net margin of 31.27%.Story continuesFor passive income, Pfizer carries a forward yield of 4.09%. Its payout ratio is on the low side at 42.3%. Also, it features 12 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Therefore, it makes for an intriguing case for high-yield dividend stocks to buy.Phillips 66 (PSX)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA hydrocarbon energy firm, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) specializes in the downstream component of the energy value chain. This arena involves refining and marketing. To be fair, the new year hasn’t treated PSX stock all that well. In addition, some of the banking jitters impacted sentiment in other areas. Since the January opener, PSX dipped over 6%.Nevertheless, it could rank among the high-yield dividend stocks to buy. Fundamentally, the normalization of society (i.e. workers returning to the office) should benefit downstream energy specialists. Financially, Phillips 66 offers several enticing attributes. For instance, its Altman Z-Score of 4.07 indicates a stable business. Operationally, its revenue growth rate of 14.9% and EBITDA growth rate of 39.3% during the past three years bolsters confidence. For passive income, the energy firm carries a forward yield of 4.43%. Moreover, its payout ratio sits at 32.04%, providing confidence regarding yield sustainability.Philip Morris (PM)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comAs one of the world’s biggest tobacco firms, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) invariably carries a controversial profile. For those willing to overlook that angle, another challenge exists: global smoking rates have declined over the past several years. From this perspective, it may not be surprising that PM went volatile in 2023. Since the Jan. opener, PM fell more than 6%.Still, it could stand among the high-yield dividend stocks to buy because the business isn’t completely irrelevant. Should economic hardships materialize, it might be possible that global smoking rates rise due to the stress relief phenomenon. Also, Philip Morris offers heated tobacco products – essentially e-cigarettes or vaporizers – that offer a popular alternative to “analog” products. In addition, Philip Morris offers a stable balance sheet (with an Altman Z-Score of 3.1). As well, it’s a richly profitable enterprise with a net margin of 28.49%.Regarding passive rewards for shareholders, the company offers a forward yield of 5.36%. While its payout ratio stands a bit on the high side at 73.92%, it features 14 years of consecutive annual dividend increases.BHP Group (BHP)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockA metals and mining firm, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) represents an intriguing take for high-yield dividend stocks. That’s because the company produces some of the hottest demand commodities in the modern world. This includes copper, iron ore, nickel, and potash. Indeed, as global economies compete in relevant sectors such as electric vehicles, securing critical resources may carry a hefty premium.Admittedly, though, the market appears a little slow in recognizing the forward outlook for BHP and its ilk. Since the January opener, shares stumbled over 6%. However, investors should look to BHP’s financials for confidence. In particular, the company owns a solid balance sheet (with an Altman Z-Score of 5.44).Also, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 14.2% and its net margin comes in at nearly 46%. Both stats rank in the upper half for the mining industry. To boot, the market prices BHP at a forward multiple of only 9.09, making it undervalued. Turning to passive income, BHP offers a forward yield of 6.25%. Its payout ratio is a tad on the high side at 63.51% but it’s relatively workable.Rio Tinto (RIO)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockBilled as a leading global mining group, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) also offers a relevant take on high-yield dividend stocks. In particular, it could play a significant role in EVs. With its specialty in copper and lithium mining, Rio basically serves the infrastructural needs of individual EV brands. Further, while it’s impossible to know which brand will win out decades from today, it’s a safe bet every automaker will require gobs of lithium.Therefore, I’m not terribly concerned about the 9% loss in RIO on a year-to-date basis. Don’t get me wrong – I’m not dismissing it. However, the longer-term implications offer an extremely attractive profile for this mining enterprise.Additionally, the company brings solid financials to the table. Its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 11.7%, while its net margin blows most competitors out of the water at 22.31%. It’s also undervalued against both trailing and forward earnings. For passive income, Rio carries a forward yield of 6.96%. As with BHP Group above, its payout ratio is a bit high at 66.63%. Still, it’s relatively workable.ICL Group (ICL)dividend stocks ceSource: ShutterstockHeading into the riskier side of high-yield dividend stocks to buy, ICL Group (NYSE:ICL) represents a multinational manufacturing concern that develops, produces, and markets fertilizers, metals, and other special-purpose chemical products. Because of the tough economic environment along with the recent banking sector jitters, ICL hasn’t performed well recently. Since the start of the new year, ICL fell over 9%.That’s not all. In the past 365 days, ICL gave up nearly 44% of its equity value. Still, those willing to accept some risk in their high-yield dividend stocks may have a compelling opportunity here. Specifically, ICL enjoys very strong financials. In addition to its stable balance sheet, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 23.6%. Also, it’s highly profitable with a net margin of 21.56%.Also, it’s undervalued, trading at a trailing multiple of 3.98. In contrast, the sector median value is 12.16 times. Regarding rewards for shareholders, ICL’s forward yield comes out to 8.38%. The tradeoff is that its payout ratio is high at 78.31%. Still, for sensible speculation, ICL may attract the right investor.Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockTied tangentially to the cannabis industry, Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR) represents a leading provider of real estate capital for the underlying “green” industry. To be clear, Innovative itself isn’t a cannabis grower. Rather, it helps enterprises that focus on this particular subsegment of the agricultural industry find success.Unfortunately, the market itself generates controversy for obvious reasons. As well, legal vagaries between federal and state laws stymie forward progress. Therefore, IIPR rates as an extremely volatile example of high-yield dividend stocks. Since the start of the year, it’s down over 18%. In the trailing year, it lost over 59% of its equity value – a hefty figure.While troubled, prospective speculators should note that Innovative features a cash-rich balance sheet.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now. Investing in the stock market is all about timing. Make the right call at the right time and you'll see your money grow, but fail to read the winds and there are chances of losing an equal amount as well. This basic principle is behind one of the more important theories in investment which are called portfolio diversification. While retail investors typically just buy stocks on the go, professionals are taught mathematical techniques to balance out their portfolios. These techniques include calculating the covariances and the variances of individual stocks within a portfolio to determine the variance of the entire collection of stocks.However, what if you didn't want to go through all this complicated math? After all, if your portfolio has fifty stocks, then you have to calculate the aforementioned metrics for each security and then regularly update the data to keep abreast of the current situation. Well, in that case, you'll have to trust your gut. The gut is a strong and underrated investment weapon, and if wisely used, can potentially make luck work in your favor. One segment of stocks that is quite important these days especially given the market turmoil, is the cyclical sector.In simple terms, cyclical stocks are those that see their fortunes rise and fall with the broader economy. As consumers see their incomes rise due to gross domestic product (GDP) growth, they have more money to spend on products and services. So naturally, cyclical companies are those that see their revenue, and the corresponding share price go up when the economy is doing well. On the flip side, should there be a slowdown, as is feared these days, then their revenues drop and the share price goes down as well.Today's market conditions merit a closer look at cyclical stocks since the U.S. economy is facing rather historic challenges. The Federal Reserve has been in a valiant fight since last year to control inflation by raising interest rates. However, this decision has proven to have a variety of painful outcomes. Out of these, the most devastating took place earlier this month when SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) collapsed (see biggest bankruptcies in US history). Its collapse was caused by two primary reasons, both of which are interrelated. The bank had invested heavily in long term bonds at a time when the Fed's return rates were low, and then when the rates went up, these securities lost their value on the market, and SVB incurred massive losses. These left it unable to keep adequate funds and the bank was taken over by regulators instead.Story continuesSVB's collapse is related directly to cyclical stocks. This is due to the fact that the bank's failure should cause some concern about an aggressive interest rate hiking cycle - a tool that is argued to be crucial in the Fed's inflation fight. However, high interest rates also slow down growth, and if you're reading carefully, then as we pointed out above, slowing growth impacts cyclical stocks. This then creates the perfect opportunity to buy, since anything that goes down, comes up as well in the stock market. Of course, a stock purchase decision should be made after careful thought and consultation with licensed professionals.Unlike other stock market sectors such as energy and basic materials, the cyclical sector consists of a wide variety of firms that cover industries such as electronic commerce firms, car manufacturers, hotels, and distributors. The one common thing across all these categories is that they are sensitive to consumer spending - hence the broader classification as 'cyclical.'Today, we'll look at some of the top cyclical stocks, with the notable picks being Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).biggest eCommerce websites in the worldKen Wolter / Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe started off our search by narrowing down the stocks classified as cyclical.

84,8db205b5-7784-3616-8999-578444cfdb3a,M,2023-03-25,Standard Chartered: Oil Prices Likely To Head Higher,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/standard-chartered-oil-prices-likely-220000515.html,1679695200,STORY,['M'],"[After a major decline that saw oil prices fall to multi-year lows, oil markets appear to have bottomed out and begun an encouraging ascent higher. Over the past two weeks, a general bearish and risk-off sentiment cut across asset markets and triggered a lengthy unwind of speculative positions in oil futures. A top commodity analyst blamed the unusually steep decline to significant selling by banks in response to gamma-effects as prices closed in a concentration of producer puts around USD 75/bbl for Brent and USD 70/bbl for WTI crude.Luckily for the bulls, in the current week, oil prices have staged a remarkable turnaround, with Brent climbing from a two-year low around $70 per barrel on Monday to USD 77.20 per barrel on Thurday’s intraday session while WTI has recovered from around $63 per barrel to $71.20 over the timeframe. That’s a nearly 10% rally in the space of just three days.And now commodity experts at Standard Chartered are saying that the path of least resistance for oil prices at this point is higher, not lower. Previously, the analysts had said that the unwinding of speculative length appears to be complete at this juncture, thus lowering selling pressure, but had warned that prices might retest the lows if the FOMC hikes its policy rate by more than the widely expected margin of 25bps.Related: Spain Calls On Importers Not To Sign New LNG Deals With RussiaThankfully, the markets have successfully scaled that wall of worry after the Fed’s hike on Wednesday came in-line with expectations. The Fed also indicated that the current rate hike cycle is nearing an end.Fast RecoveryIt gets better for the bulls: StanChart expects last week’s gamma effects to reverse course with banks buying back positions thus reinforcing the short-term rebound. Beyond that, StanChart says oil prices will largely be dictated by OPEC’s and consuming countries’ strategic inventory policy shifts.Specifically, the experts have predicted the current surplus will persist till early Q2; however, they expect the rest of the year to be in a modest deficit.Story continuesSource: Standard Chartered ResearchStanChart is not the only oil bull here.Goldman Sachs' Jeffrey Currie has acknowledged that the unexpected banking crisis has soured the macroeconomic outlook significantly and weighed heavily on oil prices, calling the situation a ""big, scarring event."" Still, the analyst expects prices to rally from here, and has only lowered his 2023 end-of-year target from $100 to $94 a barrel.According to Currie, fundamentals in the oil markets remain largely unchanged thus supporting the previous bull case. He has pointed out that key physical indicators, such as refining margins and time spreads, have remained stable, a positive sign that in-use demand remains strong and is likely to continue driving the physical market higher. Currie has also argued that the banking crisis will only have short-lived effects but very limited impact over the long-term, ""I think the key message here is fundamentally we haven't seen a big significant shift,"" he said. ""Physical markets are going to have to drive this market higher.""However, he has warned that the turmoil will result in a ""... a longer path forward.""Hedge fund manager Pierre Andurand of Andurand Capital is not a mere bull but an ultra-bull:  Andurand has predicted that crude will hit $140/bbl by the end of the year. Just like Currie, Andrurand argues that the recent oil price crash due to banking jitters was purely speculative. Further, he expects crude oil demand to peak around 2030, but ""even when we peak, oil demand won't fall down so fast. We will reach peak demand towards 110M bbl/day and then a slow decline from there.""Oil and gas stocks have also been surging higher in tandem with the commodities they track: the energy sector’s benchmark, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE), is up 4.1% since the beginning of the week.After posting record profits for two straight years amid high oil and gas prices, earnings for the energy sector are only expected to decline modestly in the current year compared to other market sectors. Late last year, a  Moody's research report projected that industry earnings will stabilize overall in 2023, though they will come in slightly below levels reached by recent peaks. The analysts note that commodity prices have declined from very high levels earlier in 2022, but have predicted that prices are likely to remain cyclically strong through 2023. This, combined with modest growth in volumes, will support strong cash flow generation for oil and gas producers. Moody’s estimates that the U.S. energy sector’s EBITDA for 2023 will clock in at $585, good for a modest 6% decline from 2022 levels.Valuations in the oil and gas sector also remain low despite two years of strong rallies with many energy and gas stocks trading at large discounts to the market.By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:EU Ban On Russian Fuel Leads To Diesel Glut In AsiaU.S. Jobs Data Provides Support For Oil After Volatile WeekNew EU Laws May Hurt The Energy TransitionRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

This opportunistic defense spending entails probable orders for companies manufacturing military missiles and related weapons.In light of the aforementioned factors, one may say that Raytheon Technologies, which enjoys an established position in the missile defense system, may continue to capitalize on the growing demand and witness a strong inflow of orders, like the latest one. This shall boost RTX’s revenues from the Missiles and Defense business unit.Growth ProspectsPer the reports from Markets and Markets, the global missile defense system market is expected to witness a CAGR of 3.9% from 2021 to 2026.

For those of you interested, check out 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Dividend stocks have faced headwinds in the past given the rise in interest rates which have led to higher Treasury yields. With higher Treasury yields, capital has moved from the broader equity market into the U.S. Treasury market and the valuations of many leading dividend stocks are arguably lower than what they would have been as a result.In terms of interest rates, the Federal Reserve on March 22 raised interest rates by 25 basis points to bring the benchmark funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%.After the interest rate raise, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said, ""We believe, however, that events in the banking system over the past two weeks are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which would in turn affect economic outcomes. It is too soon to determine the extent of these effects, and therefore too soon to tell it how monetary policy should respond. As a result, we no longer state that we anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate to quell inflation. Instead, we now anticipate that some additional policy firming may be appropriate.""Story continuesWith the Federal Reserve Chairman's comments, the broader markets declined on March 22 as the market didn't like Powell's commentary on credit conditions. Recently, Deutsche Bank stock has declined on March 24 as its credit default swaps have increased. Given Deutsche Bank is a huge bank, any substantial financial difficulties Deutsche Bank faces could affect the global economy if regulators don't do enough to contain the situation.Given the economic outcomes could be negative, an economic slowdown could also negatively affect leading dividend stocks. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.chrisdorney/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 13 Best Long Term Dividend Stocks to Buy Now, we chose 13 stocks that have competitive advantages and growth potential in the long term that also pay a dividend.We ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q4.For those of you interested, check out 14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.13 Best Long Term Dividend Stocks to Buy Now13.

94,1ad4541b-c1fe-30a3-bbc5-e00d0c8c38d2,PDCO,2023-03-25,Here's Why You Should Retain Patterson Companies (PDCO) Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-patterson-companies-142402237.html,1679581442,STORY,"['PDCO', 'COO']","[Patterson Companies, Inc.’s PDCO broad product line is driving its prospects. The company recorded currency-adjusted revenue growth in third-quarter fiscal 2023, aided by a solid dental market. The trend is expected to continue. However, supplier concentration issues and stiff competitive forces persist.In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 6.1% compared with the industry’s 12.3% and the S&amp;P 500’s 9.3% growth.This renowned global dental and animal health company has a market capitalization of $2.67 billion. The company’s earnings are estimated to grow for the next five years, at an annual rate of 7.2%. Patterson Companies’ earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering an average earnings surprise of 6.22%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Broad Product Spectrum: We are optimistic about PDCO’s wide range of consumable supplies, equipment and software, and value-added services. One of its notable offerings is a private-label brand named Pivotal (introduced during fiscal 2020). The company continues adding SKUs to its broad private-label portfolio. NaVetor, for instance, is an integrated cloud-based veterinary practice management software for its Animal Health segment.Dental Market Holds Promise: Gradual recovery in the dental market and the rebounding dental equipment business (especially in North America), assisted by promotional activities, are expected to be advantageous for Patterson Companies. Per a report by marketsandmarkets.com, the dental equipment market was valued at $6.2 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach $8.9 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of approximately 7.7%.Sales in this segment were down 4.4% year over year during third-quarter fiscal 2023. However, the company’s field sales, service and support teams remain committed to delivering value to its customers and business partners, thereby driving solid operational excellence.Story continuesSolid Prospects of the Animal Health Unit: PDCO’s  growing Animal Health unit is a key long-term growth driver. Management expects solid margin improvement in this unit through strong sales execution and stronger partnerships with product manufacturers.The company’s companion animal and production animal businesses are anticipated to maintain sustained growth. Management is optimistic that the Animal Health business is well poised to drive the top line and, thereby, margins in the near term. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the segment registered sales growth of 2.6%, owing to sustained strength in the production animal business. It also reported gross margin and operating margin improvement, on the back of higher sales growth with vendor partners, improved product mix with solid product sales, private label products, equipment and software, and a team focused on expense discipline.DownsidesStiff Competition in the Niche Space: The U.S. dental products distribution industry is highly competitive and consists chiefly of national, regional, and local full-service and mail-order distributors. Besides hundreds of small local distributors, Patterson Companies also faces competition from other national and full-service firms and at least 15 full-service distributors that operate on a regional level. The company needs to introduce products to withstand competitive pressure. Failure to do so can dilute its market share.Supplier Concentration Issues: PDCO faces significant key supplier concentration. The company’s top 10 supply vendors account for more than 40% of its cost of dental products sold in a fiscal year. The loss of relationship with these vendors will disrupt the supply of raw materials, which, in turn, will lead to lower sales. A prolonged period of economic instability could reduce customers’ ability to make payments.Estimate TrendPatterson Companies is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 earnings has decreased from $2.29 to $2.28 per share.Revenue estimates for fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 are $1.66 billion, indicating a 1.2% improvement from the year-ago quarter. Earnings estimates are 71 cents per share, implying a flat year-over-year growth.Patterson Companies, Inc. PricePatterson Companies, Inc.

100,6042d994-b651-389e-b4e3-bd5f5d71ae73,TSN,2023-03-25,"UPDATE 1-Tyson Foods plant closure raises antitrust concerns among US farmers, experts",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-tyson-foods-plant-closure-141448516.html,1679667288,STORY,"['TSN', 'LC=F', 'FC=F', 'LH=F']","[(Adds details on farmers affected by plant closure in fifth paragraph)By Leah Douglas and Tom PolansekMarch 24 (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc gave its chicken suppliers two months' notice of its plan to shut a Virginia processing plant in May, raising concerns among farmers and legal experts about the company's compliance with antitrust regulations requiring it to give 90 days' notice before ending a contract.The planned closure of the plant has left dozens of Virginia chicken growers scrambling to find new buyers in a region with few other options. It could also expose Tyson to fines under the century-old Packers and Stockyards Act (PSA), the U.S. antitrust law requiring the minimum advance warning, according to Peter Carstensen, a professor of law emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Law School who previously served in the antitrust division at the U.S. Department of Justice.Tyson told Reuters the company is not canceling any farmers' contracts and instead has committed to paying the growers for the full-term of their remaining contracts, keeping in compliance with federal regulations.Antitrust issues, particularly in meatpacking, have been a priority for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) under President Joe Biden, who in 2021 directed federal agencies to tackle consolidation. Four companies, including Tyson, control 55% to 85% of the beef, pork, and chicken markets.Tyson alerted Virginia farmers by phone on March 13 and later by mail that it will shut its Glen Allen plant on May 12, according to three poultry farmers who supply the plant. The company said there are 55 farmers with 73 contracts who supply the plant with chickens raised for meat.Tyson owns chickens it slaughters and pays the farmers to raise them. The company hatches baby birds and trucks them to farmers. The farmers then raise the birds for about six weeks, until they reach the size to be slaughtered and are trucked to the processing plant.Story continuesTyson spokesperson Alicia Buffer confirmed farmers received notice last week of the May 12 closing, and said Tyson intends to stop supplying them with chicks after March 28.She said that instead of canceling their contracts, Tyson is offering farmers a voluntary buyout package, or the option to retain them and be paid through their duration.The three farmers interviewed by Reuters have between three and 10 years left on their contracts.Farmers told Reuters they felt pressure to accept the buyout option because they were not sure how the contract could remain in force after the plant is shut and the chicks stop coming.Roger Reynolds, a farmer in Crewe, Virginia, said retaining his July 2012 contract with Tyson is not a viable option, in part because it would prevent him from selling to another poultry company if one entered the region.Another farmer with a contract to supply the plant, who asked not to be named, said they may eventually have to sell their third-generation farm as the buyout offer would not cover long-term expenses like property taxes.Carstensen, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Law School, said it was unclear if Tyson's approach would absolve it of its requirement to provide farmers 90 days' notice before ending a purchase contract, because closing the plant means it won't be processing chickens there anymore.PSA violations can carry a $29,270 fine, according to the USDA website, and Carstensen said fines could apply for each contract.The USDA, which enforces the PSA, told Reuters it is ""closely monitoring"" Tyson's planned plant closure.'WE'RE DONE'Under normal circumstances, Tyson supplies farmers with chicks, while farmers assume the costs of land and chicken houses.Documents reviewed by Reuters show the company's proposed buyout package offers payment to farmers based on their average payment per flock in 2022.They also show that farmers opting to retain existing contracts instead of accepting the buyout would have to meet Tyson's contractual requirements for their facilities even after the company stops providing chicks.Tyson said those growers would have to perform ""routine and preventive maintenance"" to meet contract requirements and called the options generous.Farmers must choose between the options by the end of March, according to the document.On Monday, about 20 Tyson farmers and local government officials gathered in a fire station in Burkeville, Virginia, and raised concerns about Tyson's short timeline for closure of the plant, attendees said.Taylor Lee, a farmer in DeWitt, Virginia, who attended the meeting, said he built two new chicken houses in 2017 and raised about 400,000 birds annually for Tyson, and is unclear what will happen to his investment.""When we're done growing chickens (for Tyson), we're done, unless somebody else steps in,"" Lee said.The nearest chicken plants to Glen Allen are 100 to 150 miles away, outside the ideal radius of 60 miles, said Hobey Bauhan, Virginia Poultry Federation president. Longer distances hike transportation costs and health risks to chickens.(Reporting by Leah Douglas in Washington and Tom Polansek in Chicago; editing by Richard Valdmanis and Nick Zieminski)]"

103,8db205b5-7784-3616-8999-578444cfdb3a,MA,2023-03-25,Standard Chartered: Oil Prices Likely To Head Higher,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/standard-chartered-oil-prices-likely-220000515.html,1679695200,STORY,"['CL=F', 'SCBFF']","[After a major decline that saw oil prices fall to multi-year lows, oil markets appear to have bottomed out and begun an encouraging ascent higher. Over the past two weeks, a general bearish and risk-off sentiment cut across asset markets and triggered a lengthy unwind of speculative positions in oil futures. A top commodity analyst blamed the unusually steep decline to significant selling by banks in response to gamma-effects as prices closed in a concentration of producer puts around USD 75/bbl for Brent and USD 70/bbl for WTI crude.Luckily for the bulls, in the current week, oil prices have staged a remarkable turnaround, with Brent climbing from a two-year low around $70 per barrel on Monday to USD 77.20 per barrel on Thurday’s intraday session while WTI has recovered from around $63 per barrel to $71.20 over the timeframe. That’s a nearly 10% rally in the space of just three days.And now commodity experts at Standard Chartered are saying that the path of least resistance for oil prices at this point is higher, not lower. Previously, the analysts had said that the unwinding of speculative length appears to be complete at this juncture, thus lowering selling pressure, but had warned that prices might retest the lows if the FOMC hikes its policy rate by more than the widely expected margin of 25bps.Related: Spain Calls On Importers Not To Sign New LNG Deals With RussiaThankfully, the markets have successfully scaled that wall of worry after the Fed’s hike on Wednesday came in-line with expectations. The Fed also indicated that the current rate hike cycle is nearing an end.Fast RecoveryIt gets better for the bulls: StanChart expects last week’s gamma effects to reverse course with banks buying back positions thus reinforcing the short-term rebound. Beyond that, StanChart says oil prices will largely be dictated by OPEC’s and consuming countries’ strategic inventory policy shifts.Specifically, the experts have predicted the current surplus will persist till early Q2; however, they expect the rest of the year to be in a modest deficit.Story continuesSource: Standard Chartered ResearchStanChart is not the only oil bull here.Goldman Sachs' Jeffrey Currie has acknowledged that the unexpected banking crisis has soured the macroeconomic outlook significantly and weighed heavily on oil prices, calling the situation a ""big, scarring event."" Still, the analyst expects prices to rally from here, and has only lowered his 2023 end-of-year target from $100 to $94 a barrel.According to Currie, fundamentals in the oil markets remain largely unchanged thus supporting the previous bull case. He has pointed out that key physical indicators, such as refining margins and time spreads, have remained stable, a positive sign that in-use demand remains strong and is likely to continue driving the physical market higher. Currie has also argued that the banking crisis will only have short-lived effects but very limited impact over the long-term, ""I think the key message here is fundamentally we haven't seen a big significant shift,"" he said. ""Physical markets are going to have to drive this market higher.""However, he has warned that the turmoil will result in a ""... a longer path forward.""Hedge fund manager Pierre Andurand of Andurand Capital is not a mere bull but an ultra-bull:  Andurand has predicted that crude will hit $140/bbl by the end of the year. Just like Currie, Andrurand argues that the recent oil price crash due to banking jitters was purely speculative. Further, he expects crude oil demand to peak around 2030, but ""even when we peak, oil demand won't fall down so fast. We will reach peak demand towards 110M bbl/day and then a slow decline from there.""Oil and gas stocks have also been surging higher in tandem with the commodities they track: the energy sector’s benchmark, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE), is up 4.1% since the beginning of the week.After posting record profits for two straight years amid high oil and gas prices, earnings for the energy sector are only expected to decline modestly in the current year compared to other market sectors. Late last year, a  Moody's research report projected that industry earnings will stabilize overall in 2023, though they will come in slightly below levels reached by recent peaks. The analysts note that commodity prices have declined from very high levels earlier in 2022, but have predicted that prices are likely to remain cyclically strong through 2023. This, combined with modest growth in volumes, will support strong cash flow generation for oil and gas producers. Moody’s estimates that the U.S. energy sector’s EBITDA for 2023 will clock in at $585, good for a modest 6% decline from 2022 levels.Valuations in the oil and gas sector also remain low despite two years of strong rallies with many energy and gas stocks trading at large discounts to the market.By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:EU Ban On Russian Fuel Leads To Diesel Glut In AsiaU.S. Jobs Data Provides Support For Oil After Volatile WeekNew EU Laws May Hurt The Energy TransitionRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now. Investing in the stock market is all about timing. Make the right call at the right time and you'll see your money grow, but fail to read the winds and there are chances of losing an equal amount as well. This basic principle is behind one of the more important theories in investment which are called portfolio diversification. While retail investors typically just buy stocks on the go, professionals are taught mathematical techniques to balance out their portfolios. These techniques include calculating the covariances and the variances of individual stocks within a portfolio to determine the variance of the entire collection of stocks.However, what if you didn't want to go through all this complicated math? After all, if your portfolio has fifty stocks, then you have to calculate the aforementioned metrics for each security and then regularly update the data to keep abreast of the current situation. Well, in that case, you'll have to trust your gut. The gut is a strong and underrated investment weapon, and if wisely used, can potentially make luck work in your favor. One segment of stocks that is quite important these days especially given the market turmoil, is the cyclical sector.In simple terms, cyclical stocks are those that see their fortunes rise and fall with the broader economy. As consumers see their incomes rise due to gross domestic product (GDP) growth, they have more money to spend on products and services. So naturally, cyclical companies are those that see their revenue, and the corresponding share price go up when the economy is doing well. On the flip side, should there be a slowdown, as is feared these days, then their revenues drop and the share price goes down as well.Today's market conditions merit a closer look at cyclical stocks since the U.S. economy is facing rather historic challenges. The Federal Reserve has been in a valiant fight since last year to control inflation by raising interest rates. However, this decision has proven to have a variety of painful outcomes. Out of these, the most devastating took place earlier this month when SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) collapsed (see biggest bankruptcies in US history). Its collapse was caused by two primary reasons, both of which are interrelated. The bank had invested heavily in long term bonds at a time when the Fed's return rates were low, and then when the rates went up, these securities lost their value on the market, and SVB incurred massive losses. These left it unable to keep adequate funds and the bank was taken over by regulators instead.Story continuesSVB's collapse is related directly to cyclical stocks. This is due to the fact that the bank's failure should cause some concern about an aggressive interest rate hiking cycle - a tool that is argued to be crucial in the Fed's inflation fight. However, high interest rates also slow down growth, and if you're reading carefully, then as we pointed out above, slowing growth impacts cyclical stocks. This then creates the perfect opportunity to buy, since anything that goes down, comes up as well in the stock market. Of course, a stock purchase decision should be made after careful thought and consultation with licensed professionals.Unlike other stock market sectors such as energy and basic materials, the cyclical sector consists of a wide variety of firms that cover industries such as electronic commerce firms, car manufacturers, hotels, and distributors. The one common thing across all these categories is that they are sensitive to consumer spending - hence the broader classification as 'cyclical.'Today, we'll look at some of the top cyclical stocks, with the notable picks being Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and Amazon.com, Inc.

The award has been offered by the 338th Enterprise Sourcing Squadron, JBSA-Randolph, San Antonio, TX.Details of the DealValued at $25 million, the contract is projected to be completed by Mar 21, 2026.

Combat aircraft constitute a major portion of this portfolio. It is imperative to mention here that the F-16 Falcon jets have significantly risen in importance on a global scale over the past few years.Over the past couple of years, the F-16 witnessed significant development, with nations like Taiwan, Bulgaria, Morocco and Bahrain signing agreements to procure new F-16 aircraft. To reap the benefits of the rising demand for F-16, Lockheed Martin introduced F-16 Block 70/72 in 2020, the most advanced F-16 aircraft, combining numerous capabilities and structural upgrades. This model provides a new aircraft structure that lasts 50% longer than the previously produced F-16 aircraft. Such advancements might have been ushering in contracts from Pentagon and other U.S. allies, like the latest one, thereby boosting Lockheed Martin’s revenue prospects.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, other nations like Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest weapons exporter worldwide, the nation has been spending significantly on defense products including combat aircraft.Story continuesLockheed, being a prominent combat aircraft manufacturer in the United States, enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fighter aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 3.95% during the 2023-2028 period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities, and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Lockheed, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Boeing BA, Northrop Grumman NOC and Textron TXT.Boeing’s Defense, Space &amp; Security segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this homebuilder have returned +4.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.5% change. The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, to which PulteGroup belongs, has gained 4.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $1.78 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.52 points to a change of -30.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.36 indicates a change of -2.2% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PulteGroup.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.27 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $14.09 billion and $14.06 billion estimates indicate -13.2% and -0.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $5.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.7%. EPS of $3.63 for the same period compares with $2.51 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +12.33%.

In some ways, they have just as much at stake. And they are not standing by idly. Some TikTok creators have descended on D.C. in recent days to lobby lawmakers; others have been vocal about their opposition to an all-out ban of TikTok, a unit of China's ByteDance, which has 150 million monthly active users in the U.S.""I think there needs to be a reframing of this conversation,” said Joel Bervell, a medical student and TikTok creator whose channel focuses on medical education. “TikTok may be owned by a Chinese company, but so many of the moments that are created there are specifically and uniquely American.""Bervell's TikTok page, March 23, 2023.TikTok's creators are fervently devoted to the platform and, for many, it’s about how TikTok's algorithm uniquely works. For Sasha Allen, whose channel has 1 million followers and often offers a humorous and vulnerable experience about being young and transgender, TikTok’s algorithm rewards authenticity.“On TikTok, a lot of creators share so much more than surface-level videos,” he said. “The videos for me that do the best are the ones where I’m authentic.”Adrianna Wise, who goes by Bae, has focused her channel on cooking and her bakery Coco’s Confectionary Kitchen. She says that TikTok has invested in her profoundly as a Black creator.""I’ve honed in on TikTok because I’ve really found what they do for creators of color and diverse creators is really creating a space where we feel safe to contribute,” said Wise. “I don't want to advocate for a platform that sets us up to fail. On other platforms, I’ve seen the intentional suppression of content for people of color, but TikTok isn’t about that. They have invested in us in a way that no platform has.""Story continuesThe programs that both Wise and Bervell pointed to include the ""TikTok for Black Creatives"" incubator, a three-month program launched in 2021. Additionally, there's a grant tied to the incubator, called the MACRO x TikTok Black Creatives Grant, which gave 10 participants $50,000 to build their ""dream creative project."" Bervell, a Yale graduate who's devoted much of his time to communicating about inequalities in American healthcare, was among the first recipients of that grant.""TikTok knows the power of paying people what they're worth,"" he said. ""Black creators are often told 'teach us this information,' but they're not paid for their time.""Wise's TikTok page, March 23, 2023.'TikTok offered me a microphone'Bervell, Allen, and Wise said that their time on TikTok has changed their lives for the better.""I never thought I’d be doing brand deals, or negotiating contracts, but that’s what TikTok has taught me,” said Bervell, who has collaborated with brands like Neutrogena (JNJ), Samsung (SSUN.F), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL). “My parents are immigrants from West Africa, and I now have an opportunity to pay off my student loans even before I finish medical school.""Bervell’s success on TikTok has vaulted him into high-level medical policy conversations. He’s participant in the White House Office of Public Engagement’s Healthcare Leaders in Social Media Roundtable and has worked with the World Health Organization to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 misinformation. Bervell is concerned that a TikTok ban will stifle much of the work that’s been done on the platform.He told Yahoo Finance: “These (potential) bans for me feel like an effort to shut down a conversation that needs to happen—and I think that's how so many creators of color feel right now. There are conversations happening on TikTok that aren't happening anywhere else on the Internet.""Allen's TikTok page, March 23, 2023.For Allen, TikTok has been a creative outlet, one that’s propelled him to TikTok stardom and opened him to perspectives he never would not have encountered otherwise.“I think the insane thing about TikTok is that it’s really unlike any other social media site, because you can spread ideas so rapidly,” he told Yahoo Finance. ""I’ve had people reach out to me and say, ‘You’ve changed my views about being trans,’ and I also feel like I’ve been exposed to things on TikTok I never would have experienced otherwise.”Allen, Bervell, and Wise all understand lawmakers' concerns about the platform—but they're not convinced. Wise feels safe on TikTok, even and especially compared to other platforms.“I can’t be upset or angry at these lawmakers. I think they believe they’re doing what they intend to do – protect Americans. But my call to action for them, change-makers and lawmakers, is to get on the platform, experience the community. For them, the best way to spread their message is actually on TikTok.”'They have no idea how many people will freak out'Allen, who's 21, said that lawmakers should also worry about pushback from teenagers and young adults.“If they ban TikTok, they are absolutely clueless, because they have no idea how many people will freak out,"" he said. ""For young people, this is the equivalent of someone saying, ‘We'll, take the television away, take books away.’ This is that serious for us.”TikTok app logo is seen in this illustration taken, August 22, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationSome say too serious in come cases.""Social platforms should be used to build an audience, not a place to build a business,"" said Ahad Khan, CEO of Kajabi, which develops platforms for creators.He added: ""Unfortunately, creators who rely solely on these platforms are at the mercy of changing algorithms that can drastically impact their ad revenue, hard-to-predict and often uninspiring brand deals, and a community of followers that could disappear at a moment’s notice. Imagine spending all your time, energy, and resources building a house on sand.""How do creators respond to that? Or the suggestion that they could, well, just find another platform for their work and ideas?Bervell has an answer: ""We've tried that. TikTok is unique in the way its algorithm highlights creators who are overlooked… TikTok connects you to people you don’t know, but should know. So, when people say, why can’t you go to another app? The answer is that we’re already there, but the impact won’t be the same.”Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

119,06296bcb-385e-3dd3-b58e-cb090ca2453d,MOS,2023-03-25,The Mosaic Company (MOS) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mosaic-company-mos-trending-stock-130001799.html,1679662801,STORY,['MOS'],"[Mosaic (MOS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this fertilizer maker have returned -16.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.5% change. The Zacks Fertilizers industry, to which Mosaic belongs, has lost 10.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Mosaic is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -43.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -35.9%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.55 points to a change of -31.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -15.8%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.45 indicates a change of -27.8% from what Mosaic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Mosaic is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MOS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Mosaic, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.34 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -14.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $15.13 billion and $12.73 billion estimates indicate -20.9% and -15.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMosaic reported revenues of $4.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.7%. EPS of $1.74 for the same period compares with $1.95 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.31 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.05%. The EPS surprise was -16.35%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Mosaic is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

The reports likely confirm that manufacturing is in recession, weighed down by higher borrowing costs. With financial conditions tightening following the recent failure of two regional banks, the outlook for both business investment and manufacturing is cloudy.""We anticipate gloomier times ahead as spending softens, lending standards tighten and higher interest rates than the post-global financial crisis period make it costly to purchase capital goods and finance investment,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""The recent bout of banking sector stress will only add to upcoming strains.""Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 0.2% last month, the Commerce Department said. Data for January was revised lower to show these so-called core capital goods orders rising 0.3% instead of 0.8% as previously reported.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders unchanged. Core capital goods orders advanced 4.3% on a year-on-year basis in February. The data is not adjusted for inflation. Producer prices for finished goods, excluding food, have exceeded the monthly gains in core capital goods orders.That means inflation adjusted orders were weak. The report is consistent with regional Federal Reserve bank factory surveys showing business sentiment remaining depressed so far this year.Story continuesThat was reinforced by the S&amp;P Global survey showing its flash manufacturing PMI climbed to a still-subdued 49.3 in March from 47.3 in February. Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.3% of the U.S. economy, has contracted for two straight quarters as higher interest rates undercut demand for goods, which are typically bought on credit.Spending is also shifting away from goods to services, while the dollar's past appreciation and sluggish global growth are curbing exports. The inventory cycle is also turning, with restocking by businesses slowing.There are expectations that the tightening of lending standards by banks following recent financial markets turmoil could make credit less available to households and businesses.The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, but indicated it was on the verge of pausing further increases in borrowing costs, in a nod to the financial markets stress.Stocks on Wall Street fell on renewed fears of contagion in the banking sector. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.BLOW TO INVESTMENT""While the extent of the drag from events over the past couple of weeks remains to be seen, it would be a surprise if it didn't deal a further blow to investment, particularly for small firms more reliant on bank financing,"" said Andrew Hunter, deputy chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.Last month, there were increases in orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components, fabricated metal products and well as primary metals. But orders for computers and electronic products dipped and machinery fell.Shipments of core capital goods were unchanged after increasing 0.9% in January. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the gross domestic product measurement. Shipments of nondefense capital goods, which also go into the calculation of GDP, fell 0.6% after declining 1.7% in January.Economists at Goldman Sachs trimmed their first-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 2.4% annualized rate from a 2.6% pace. Business spending on equipment contracted in the fourth quarter, helping to restrain GDP growth to a 2.7% rate. The economy grew at a 3.2% pace in the third quarter.""The manufacturing sector is in recession and will be a drag on the broader economy,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. ""Business equipment spending may contract in real terms in the first-quarter GDP report.""Orders for items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more decreased 1.0% in February. These so-called durable goods orders dropped 5.0% in January.Durable goods orders last month were pulled down by a 6.6% decline in the volatile civilian aircraft category, which followed a 56.3% plunge in January. Boeing reported on its website that it had received just five aircraft orders in February, sharply down from 55 in January.Orders for transportation equipment fell 2.8% after tumbling 14.0% in January. Motor vehicle orders decreased 0.9%.Unfilled orders at manufacturers slipped 0.1% after being unchanged in January, which does not bode well for factory production. Inventories at factories rebounded 0.2%.""As inventories rise, container volume to U.S. ports is declining, suggesting that shipments could weaken further in the months ahead,"" said Erik Johnson, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrea Ricci)]"

134,38224e0d-d9ef-38cf-bf35-447d6568c91d,NOC,2023-03-25,Lockheed (LMT) Wins Deal to Offer Training for F-16 Jets,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-lmt-wins-deal-offer-131701810.html,1679663821,STORY,"['LMT', 'TXT', 'NOC']","[Lockheed Martin Corp.’s LMT business segment, Rotary and Mission Systems, recently clinched a contract to provide international training for F-16 jets. The award has been offered by the 338th Enterprise Sourcing Squadron, JBSA-Randolph, San Antonio, TX.Details of the DealValued at $25 million, the contract is projected to be completed by Mar 21, 2026. This contract will offer F-16 operational capability for countries that have purchased F-16 jets recently.For nations that had previously purchased and operated F-16 jets, this contract offers aircraft maintenance and pilot training to support ongoing sustainment training or in-country training to aid aircraft upgrade programs.This award involves Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to Bahrain.Importance of the F-16 JetsOver the past decade, a rapid rise in global terrorism and adverse geopolitical situations across borders have boosted the demand for defense products. Combat aircraft constitute a major portion of this portfolio. It is imperative to mention here that the F-16 Falcon jets have significantly risen in importance on a global scale over the past few years.Over the past couple of years, the F-16 witnessed significant development, with nations like Taiwan, Bulgaria, Morocco and Bahrain signing agreements to procure new F-16 aircraft. To reap the benefits of the rising demand for F-16, Lockheed Martin introduced F-16 Block 70/72 in 2020, the most advanced F-16 aircraft, combining numerous capabilities and structural upgrades. This model provides a new aircraft structure that lasts 50% longer than the previously produced F-16 aircraft. Such advancements might have been ushering in contracts from Pentagon and other U.S. allies, like the latest one, thereby boosting Lockheed Martin’s revenue prospects.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, other nations like Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest weapons exporter worldwide, the nation has been spending significantly on defense products including combat aircraft.Story continuesLockheed, being a prominent combat aircraft manufacturer in the United States, enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fighter aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 3.95% during the 2023-2028 period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities, and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Lockheed, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Boeing BA, Northrop Grumman NOC and Textron TXT.Boeing’s Defense, Space &amp; Security segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft. This segment's primary products include military aircraft like F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15, P-8, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk aircraft.BA stock has a long-term earnings growth of 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales implies a 22.1% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned combat aircraft. The company also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems. This is to help warfighters in accomplishing missions anytime, anywhere and under any conditions.NOC stock boasts a long-term earnings growth of 3.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales indicates a 4.6% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense designs, builds and supports versatile and globally known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Some of Textron’s renowned products include the Beechcraft T-6C trainer and AT-6 Wolverine.TXT stock boasts a long-term earnings growth of 11.2%.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now. Investing in the stock market is all about timing. Make the right call at the right time and you'll see your money grow, but fail to read the winds and there are chances of losing an equal amount as well. This basic principle is behind one of the more important theories in investment which are called portfolio diversification. While retail investors typically just buy stocks on the go, professionals are taught mathematical techniques to balance out their portfolios. These techniques include calculating the covariances and the variances of individual stocks within a portfolio to determine the variance of the entire collection of stocks.However, what if you didn't want to go through all this complicated math? After all, if your portfolio has fifty stocks, then you have to calculate the aforementioned metrics for each security and then regularly update the data to keep abreast of the current situation. Well, in that case, you'll have to trust your gut. The gut is a strong and underrated investment weapon, and if wisely used, can potentially make luck work in your favor. One segment of stocks that is quite important these days especially given the market turmoil, is the cyclical sector.In simple terms, cyclical stocks are those that see their fortunes rise and fall with the broader economy. As consumers see their incomes rise due to gross domestic product (GDP) growth, they have more money to spend on products and services. So naturally, cyclical companies are those that see their revenue, and the corresponding share price go up when the economy is doing well. On the flip side, should there be a slowdown, as is feared these days, then their revenues drop and the share price goes down as well.Today's market conditions merit a closer look at cyclical stocks since the U.S. economy is facing rather historic challenges. The Federal Reserve has been in a valiant fight since last year to control inflation by raising interest rates. However, this decision has proven to have a variety of painful outcomes. Out of these, the most devastating took place earlier this month when SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) collapsed (see biggest bankruptcies in US history). Its collapse was caused by two primary reasons, both of which are interrelated. The bank had invested heavily in long term bonds at a time when the Fed's return rates were low, and then when the rates went up, these securities lost their value on the market, and SVB incurred massive losses. These left it unable to keep adequate funds and the bank was taken over by regulators instead.Story continuesSVB's collapse is related directly to cyclical stocks. This is due to the fact that the bank's failure should cause some concern about an aggressive interest rate hiking cycle - a tool that is argued to be crucial in the Fed's inflation fight. However, high interest rates also slow down growth, and if you're reading carefully, then as we pointed out above, slowing growth impacts cyclical stocks. This then creates the perfect opportunity to buy, since anything that goes down, comes up as well in the stock market. Of course, a stock purchase decision should be made after careful thought and consultation with licensed professionals.Unlike other stock market sectors such as energy and basic materials, the cyclical sector consists of a wide variety of firms that cover industries such as electronic commerce firms, car manufacturers, hotels, and distributors. The one common thing across all these categories is that they are sensitive to consumer spending - hence the broader classification as 'cyclical.'Today, we'll look at some of the top cyclical stocks, with the notable picks being Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and Amazon.com, Inc.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Nike (NKE).Nike currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.79, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 26 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.79 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 26 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 14 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 53.9% and 11.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NKEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NKECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Nike here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Nike, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in NKE?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Nike, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3% over the past month to $3.22.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nike.

143,36777512-4e22-3d9d-ba2c-a006b4f70ab9,WFC,2023-03-25,7 Bank Stocks to Buy on the Dip,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-bank-stocks-buy-dip-201604508.html,1679429764,STORY,"['BAC', 'USB', 'CSGN.SW', 'WFC', 'JPM', 'GSBD', 'HSBC', 'PNC']","[Bank stocks continue to be volatile as professional traders and individual investors try to assess how bad the problems in the sector really are following the collapse of three lenders in the U.S. and the $3.2 billion takeover of Switzerland’s Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) by rival UBS (NYSE:UBS). As the U.S. government steps in to guarantee the deposits at now defunct Silicon Valley Bank, and the largest banks in America inject $30 billion of deposits into troubled lender First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC), investors have been understandably rattled and moved their money out of bank stocks. However, by most accounts, the selloff of bank stocks has been an overreaction. By nearly all accounts, this is not a repeat of the 2008-09 financial crisis. The good news for long-term investors is that many rock-solid bank stocks are now on sale as their share prices have been pushed lower in recent weeks. Here are seven bank stocks to buy on the dip.JPMJPMorgan$127.18GSGoldman Sachs$313.67HSBCHSBC$34.30WFCWells Fargo$37.20BACBank of America$27.64USBUS Bancorp$34.79PNCPNC Financial$124.40JPMorgan Chase (JPM)JPM stock: the JPMorgan logo on top of a buildingSource: ShutterstockLet’s begin with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), which remains the largest U.S. bank by market capitalization. Few banks are as solid today as JPMorgan Chase. Many analysts refer to the lender as having a “fortress balance sheet.” And despite the turmoil of financial markets over the past year, JPMorgan Chase has found a way to continue reporting strong quarterly earnings. The bank’s profit for the fourth and final quarter of 2022 was $11 billion, or $3.57 per share, compared with $10.4 billion, or $3.33 per share, during the same period a year earlier.The revenue of JPMorgan’s investment-banking unit continued to decline in Q4 due to a lack of deals caused by the stock market’s struggles. The investment banking unit’s revenue declined 57% year-over-year last quarter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStory continuesHowever, the lender’s trading revenue grew amid the market volatility as investors repositioned their portfolios to navigate the current high interest-rate environment. Moreover, the bank’s revenue from fixed income trading rose 12% YOY in Q2, .It should come as no surprise that JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is reportedly advising First Republic Bank on its recovery plan given the clout that JPM and its management team have in the global banking sector.Goldman Sachs (GS)In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the backgroundSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comGoldman Sachs’ (NYSE:GS) consumer banking unit, called “Marcus,” got off to a promising start in 2016, but it was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and never recovered. Goldman ultimately lost $3 billion on Marcus, which was rolled into a “platform solutions business” before being shut down and leaving the Wall Street titan with a rare black eye.However, there is every reason to believe that Goldman Sachs will bounce back and return to its winning ways, making it one of the best  bank stocks to buy on the dip. The company has taken decisive steps to right its ship, including cutting more than 3,000 jobs and slashing its annual bonus payments to bankers by 40%.The layoffs have been concentrated in Goldman’s investment banking division, whose corporate deal making has meaningfully slowed over the last year. The bank’s CEO, David Solomon, has said that he will refocus the investment bank on what it does best: making money for corporate clients.HSBC Holdings (HSBC)HSBC logo on corporate buildingSource: ShutterstockInvestors looking for a solid foreign bank outside the U.S. should consider HSBC Bank (NYSE:HSBC). The lender, which began life in Hong Kong and primarily served Asian markets is today based in London and is increasingly focusing on Europe while also trying to break into North America.In fact, HSBC is now the biggest bank in Europe with more than $10 trillion of assets under custody.  While HSBC recently announced that it was exiting Canada after a failed foray into that market, the sale of its Canadian unit will result in a special one-time dividend payment of 21 cents per share to its stockholders.HSBC announced the special dividend payment along with strong fourth-quarter results that showed a profit of $5.2 billion, which was 108% higher than the $2.5 billion of net income that  the bank had recorded a year earlier, and higher than the $4.97 billion that analysts who cover the lender had, on average, expected.Due to the strong Q4 print, HSBC announced a regular dividend payment to shareholders of 40 cents per share, which equates to a yield of 4.72% and is among the highest of any bank.Wells Fargo (WFC)Wells Fargo (WFC) bank sign in yellow and red with wagon logo. The sign is flanked by tall grassSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comU.S. lender Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) made headlines at the start of this year when it announced that it was exiting the multitrillion-dollar U.S. mortgage market. The announcement was a shock given that Wells Fargo was a leader in the U.S. home loan market, managing as much as $201.8 billion of such loans, according to data from Inside Mortgage Finance.The lender said it was getting out of the real estate game due to a combination of onerous regulations and rising interest rates that have dampened the market over the last year.Going forward, Wells Fargo plans to focus exclusively on providing home loans for its rich clients of its wealth-management unit.Additionally, the lender said it was generating more of its revenue from investment banking and credit cards rather than from mortgages and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). While a surprise, Wells Fargo’s exit from the real estate market is not unprecedented. That’s because JPMorgan Chase got out of the mortgage market after the 2008 financial crisis.Wells Fargo announced its exit from the housing sector as it reported disappointing Q$ earnings in January.Bank of America (BAC)bank of america stockSource: PL Gould / Shutterstock.comAnother U.S. lender that is viewed as stable and strong today is Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). The second biggest bank in the U.S. after JPMorgan Chase has come along way since the dark days of the 2008 financial crisis. Between late 2007 and mid-2009, BAC stock declined more than 80%, and, at one point, was trading for just $6 a share and in danger of becoming a penny stock. Fortunately, Bank of America weathered the storm and even purchased financial firm Merrill Lynch coming out of the crisis and is today much healthier than in the past.Along with JPMorgan, Bank of America helped to organize the group of 11 banks that agreed to deposit $30 billion in troubled lender First Republic to help shore-up its finances and rally confidence in the banking sector. Bank of America is thriving under the leadership of CEO Brian Moynihan, who has the lender focused on consumer banking and loans. That strategy helped Bank of America post a Q4 2022 earnings beat despite a sharp downturn in investment banking revenues. BAC stock is down 15% on the year and a definite buy at current levels.US Bancorp (USB)US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is not quite as well known as the four largest lenders in America. However, US Bancorp is the fifth biggest bank in the U.S. based in assets despite being primarily based in the Midwest. Maybe it’s because of its roots in the American heartland, but U.S. Bancorp has largely avoided scandal throughout its nearly 100 years of existence. And many analysts single the bank out for being one of the best managed financial institutions in the country.In particular, bullish analysts point out that US Bancorp has low-cost deposits that other banks can’t match, and more than enough funds on hand to cover potential loan losses. The bank also has limited exposure to troubled foreign lenders such as Credit Suisse.One of US Bancorp’s fans is none other than famed investor Warren Buffett. While he has sold most of his bank stocks in recent years, Buffett continues to own more than 8 million shares of USB stock, worth more than $300 million.PNC Financial Services (PNC)An image of a solar panel in the shape of a piggy bank on a rooftop; concept for solar stocksSource: Andreas Prott / ShutterstockAlso among the 10 biggest U.S. banks with more than $500 billion of assets is PNC Financial Services (NYSE:PNC). Like other lenders, PNC stock has been dragged lower by the current banking troubles and investors’ shaky sentiment. However, by all accounts, PNC Financial remains a sturdy bank that has none of the underlying problems that plagued a number of regional banks in recent weeks. In fact, there were rumors that PNC Financial was going to try to buy Silicon Valley Bank following its collapse. But the bank has ruled out that scenario.The decision to steer clear of Silicon Valley Bank could be a smart one given the financial mess at that institution. PNC’s revenue grew 4% in the final quarter of last year versus the same period a year earlier to $5.76 billion.During Q4, the company also $1.2 billion to shareholders through its generous dividend that pays $1.50 per share each quarter for a yield of 4.55%. Like its peers, PNC stock has been dragged lower due to the current turmoil of the financial sector.As the first quarter nears its end, PNC Financial’s stock is down 21%. Investors should view the decline as a buying opportunity.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in BAC.

CEO Jack Dorsey dismissed the comments as factually incorrect and investors may be wondering if the popular fintech stock was oversold.Let’s see if it's time to buy Block’s stock after this week's selloff.Hindenburg ReportActivist short-selling firm Hindenburg Research stated that Block inflates its user numbers causing shares of SQ to fall 15% on Thursday. Along with the inflated metrics, the selloff was intensified as the report also alleges that Block enabled criminals to use its cash app platform due to a lack of compliance controls.The report was based on information Hindenburg says was gathered over a two year span. Still, Block stated Hindenburg's comments are misleading and were designed to deceive and confuse investors.Some investors appear to be taking Hindenburg's report with a grain of salt as Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management has already added large positions in Block’s stock following the selloff.Performance &amp; Valuation Looking at Block’s performance and valuation will give a better gauge on if its time to buy SQ shares after this week’s decline. Block's stock ended the week down almost 20%. Year to date, Block stock has now dropped -3% to trail the S&amp;P 500 and online payment solution competitor PayPal’s (PYPL) +3% performances.However, Block stock is still up +372% since going public in 2015 to easily topped the benchmark and PayPal’s +103% during this time span.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBlock stock currently trades at $60 per share and 37.1X forward earnings. This is well below its extreme historical high and 93% beneath the median of 551.3X. With that being said, Block still trades above PayPal’s 14.8X and its industry average of 20.8X.  Growth &amp; Outlook Monitoring Block’s growth and outlook will certainly be important after the Hindenburg accusations and the steep decline in SQ shares.   Story continuesIn this regard, Block’s earnings are projected to jump 67% this year at $1.67 per share compared to EPS of $1.00 in 2022. Even better, fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to climb another 39% to $2.33 per share. Earnings estimate revisions have slightly declined over the last two months.On the top line, sales are forecasted to be up 12% in FY23 and rise another 14% in FY24 to $22.57 billion. More impressive, fiscal 2024 would represent 379% growth over the last five years with 2019 sales at $4.71 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineBlock stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. While the top-line growth of the company is very intriguing much remains to be seen on the bottom line with inflation affecting many tech stocks over the last year.Still, Block does trade attractively relative to its past, and holding on to shares at current levels could be rewarding when considering its performance since going public. The acquisitions in the Hindenburg report will certainly bring attention to any better practices that are needed as Block continues to grow its financial and marketing services and comprehensive commerce ecosystem.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For many consumers, this is their opportunity to make affording larger purchases a lot more manageable.According to a report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), between 2019 and 2021, the number of BNPL loans originated in the U.S. by the top five lenders grew by 970 percent. Consumers seem to favor the option to spread payments out over a few weeks or months—and unlike traditional credit cards, many BNPL platforms are interest and fee-free.But there has to be a catch, right? Well, not BNPL platforms have the same requirements, rates, and fees. Before you agree to make a purchase using BNPL, you should be aware of how it works and how it could impact your finances.To help make your decision a little easier, the Fortune RecommendsTM editorial team reviewed a few of the most popular BNPL platforms. We weighed annual percentage rates (APRs), late fees, loan terms, mobile app ratings, and more to help you decide if buying now, and paying later is worth it.

(Note: eligibility requirements, fees, and other numbers in our list below are up to date as of March 24, 2023, and are subject to change.)1. ZipAbout: Zip was founded in Australia in 2013, and provides BNPL services to consumers, merchants, and businesses across the globe. The platform currently offers interest-free credit across a directory of more than 18,500 merchants.APR: 0%Loan terms: 4 installments over 6 weeksLate feesIf your installment payment is late, you may incur an initial late fee of $7.Story continuesCustomer supportCustomer support representatives can be reached via phone every day of the week between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. EST, as well as via live chat Monday through Sunday from 7:00 a.m. to  11:00 p.m. EST, and via email.Our verdictGood for those who want to pay off their purchase sooner, rather than later. Zip took the top spot on our list for its interest-free model and for having one of the lowest late fees on our list. The app also boasts an average mobile app rating of 4.4 on Google Play and the App Store. Using Zip has zero impact on your credit score and you can use the service almost anywhere Visa is accepted. This platform did have the shortest repayment timeline out of all of the platforms we reviewed. When using this service, customers will split their purchase up into four installments over the course of six weeks.

AfterpayAbout: Afterpay was founded in Australia in 2014 and currently serves millions of customers and businesses around the globe. The platform currently offers BNPL services to more than 15,000 merchants.APR: 0%Loan terms: 6 months, 12 months, or in 4 interest-free paymentsLate feesAfterpay charges an initial $10 late fee if a payment is not processed on or before the due date, and a further $7 if the payment remains unpaid 7 days after the due date. For each order below $40, a maximum of one $10 late fee may be applied per order. For each order of $40 or above, the total of the late fees that may be applied are capped at 25% of the original order value or $68, whichever is less.Customer supportAfterpay representatives are available to answer any questions you have via email or in-app chat live chat which is available 24/7, although response times may vary.Our verdictGood for those who want to shop on their phones.

Sezzle not only offers the longest repayment option on our list, but it also offers a unique perk that most BNPL platforms do not: the ability to have your payment history reported to the credit bureaus. When you upgrade from a standard Sezzle account to “Sezzle Up,” your payment history will be reported to all three major credit bureaus—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. At the end of each month, the platform will review the overall standing of your account, including your outstanding balance and payment status. That month-end standing is then reported to the credit bureaus. Sezzle has an average rating of 4.75 across both app stores and had one of the highest customer service scores on our list.4. KlarnaAbout: Klarna was founded in Stockholm, Sweden, in 2005 and now serves 150 million consumers across the globe, across more than 500,000 merchants in 45 countries.APR: 0%–29.99%Loan terms: 1–24 monthsLate feesA late fee of up to $7 may be charged if any scheduled payment remains unpaid after 10 days—not to exceed 25% of your total purchase amount.Customer supportKlarna representatives can be reached 24/7 via phone or chat.Our verdictGood for those who want to finance a larger purchase. Klarna made our list for its 24/7 customer service options, wide range of repayment options, and its credit limit (or lack thereof). When you use Klarna, there is no predefined spending limit. Instead, a new automated approval decision will be made each time you use the service that will tell you what your credit limit is. Consumers who are managing their credit responsibly may see an increase in their purchasing power over time, which could make it easier to cover larger purchases. Klarna’s app, which has an average mobile app rating of 4.6, also offers a rewards club that will allow you to earn points on your purchases, a place to store loyalty cards from your favorite stores, price drop notifications, and more.5. PaypalAbout: Paypal is a notable name in the mobile payment app space, and its services have expanded to include BNPL services across $325 million merchants worldwide.APR: 0%–29.99%Loan terms: 4 interest-free payments made bi-weekly or 6, 12, or 24 monthly paymentsLate feesPayPal does not charge any late fees.Customer supportPaypal representatives can be contacted in-app via the message center or by calling the customer service line between 6:00 a.m. PT and  6:00 p.m. PT Monday through Sunday.Our verdictGood for those who want a greater selection of merchants to choose from. Paypal’s “Pay in 4” and “Pay Monthly” BNPL plans took the final spot on our list for having the greatest selection of merchants to choose from. In addition to its wide network of partnerships, Paypal offers flexible loan terms, zero late fees, and purchase protection feature which will reimburse you if the item you ordered doesn’t arrive or doesn’t match the original description. The BNPL option offers two plans, one for purchases between $30–$1,500 and a monthly financing plan for purchases between $199–$10,000. Users can enroll in autopay under both plans.What to know about buy-now, pay-later platforms Buy-now, pay-later platforms can make it easier to afford purchases that are just outside your budget by breaking down the lump sum cost into smaller, easier to manage installments. These installment loans may come with interest and fees that vary from platform to platform. Typically, merchants will partner with a buy-now, pay-later platform and offer this as a payment method at checkout.Should you choose to go this route, you’ll be directed to that platform’s site where you’ll need to create an account and provide personal identifying information (PII) such as your Social Security number (SSN), date of birth, contact information, and more. In many cases, the platform will use this information to perform a soft credit check (which doesn’t impact your credit score) to determine whether or not to approve you for a line of credit and determine your credit limit, APR, and more.How to choose a buy-now, pay-later serviceIf you’re considering using a buy-now, pay-later platform to finance a purchase or multiple, there are a few key factors you’ll want to consider:The merchant network: Depending on the purchase you plan to make, you’ll want to make sure that the buy-now, pay-later service you’re using works with the retailer you’re buying from. These platforms typically have a directory on their website that you can browse through to see which retailers they’re partnered with or the retailer may also list buy-now, pay-later as an option at checkout.Interest rate and fees: The interest rate you’re offered will depend on several factors unique to your personal finances, credit history, and more. However, many platforms will offer a range for the interest rate they may charge and how much you could incur in late fees if you miss a payment. Read the fine print to determine if the splurge is worth the potential fees you could owe down the line.Loan terms: The terms for your loan will vary widely across platforms. When you’re thinking about the purchase you want to finance, you should also be mindful of your desired repayment timeline. While some platforms break down your payments across several months, others offer maximum loan terms of just a few weeks, which may be harder to manage depending on your financial situation.Frequently asked questionsDo buy-now, pay-later apps hurt your credit score?Buy-now, pay-later apps don’t generally report payment information to the credit bureaus, although there are apps that do. However, this does not mean late payments won’t incur hefty fees or be sent to collections if you do not adhere to the terms of your loan. And, it also means that a positive payment history will not help you build credit over time, in most cases.Can I get approved to us a buy-now, pay-later app if I have bad credit?Approval will be determined by the lender you’re choosing. Some buy-now, pay-later platforms may extend you a line of credit even if you have a lower credit score, but this may come at the cost of a higher APR or a lower credit limit.What are the disadvantages of buy-now, pay-later?Some downsides of buy-now, pay-later services include late fees, the temptation to overspend, and potentially steep interest rates.Our methodologyThe Fortune RecommendsTM team compared 7 of the most popular buy-now, pay-later apps and services to help you find the best platform for your borrowing needs. To come up with our final list, we ranked the best apps and exchanges on the following categories and weighted each category as set forth in the percentages below:Maximum annual percentage rate (APR) (25%): Platforms that did not charge any interest or charged low interest rates scored higher than platforms with higher interest rates.Maximum late fee (20%): Many buy-now, pay-later platforms charge a fee for late or missed payments. We ranked platforms that had lower or no late fees at all higher on our list.Number of merchants (20%): We rewarded platforms that offered financing options for a greater variety of merchants.0–1,000: 1 point1,001–5,000: 2 points5,001–10,000: 3 points10,000-15,000: 4 points15,000+: 5 pointsMaximum loan term (20%): We favored platforms that offered longer loan terms, providing consumers with a longer repayment timeline.Mobile app rating (10%): We calculated the average mobile application rating for each platform using ratings from the App Store and Google Play and rewarded platforms that had a higher mobile app rating.Customer service options (5%): Top picks offer customers three ways to get in contact: chat support, by phone, or even email. Among the three options, we gave phone support the most weight.We think that the best platforms offer financing for purchases from a large number of merchants, low or zero APRs, longer loan terms, a high mobile app rating, and various customer service options. The requirements, fees, and merchants partnered with these platforms may change and financing terms, limits, and APRs are dependent on your individual credit profile, income, and more.View this interactive chart on Fortune.comThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

If you're only interested in the top 5, feel free to skip our in-depth analysis and jump straight to the 5 Best Crypto Hardware Wallets in 2023.As cryptocurrencies continue to gain popularity, ensuring the security of digital assets has become an increasingly important concern. Crypto wallets are digital tools used to store and manage digital assets, and they play a critical role in safeguarding against cyber threats. With the wide variety of wallets available on the market, choosing the right one can be tricky. In this article, we will discuss the importance of crypto security, the difference between hot and cold storage, the key factors to consider when choosing a hardware wallet, and the best crypto hardware wallets available.The Growing Importance Of Crypto SecurityCryptocurrencies function in a decentralized manner, operating independently from banks and governments. While this independence provides freedom, it makes cryptocurrencies more vulnerable to cyber-attacks and fraudulent activities.Consequently, ensuring the security of crypto assets has become a crucial concern for industry professionals and users alike. According to Forbes, with the number of hacking incidents on the rise, the losses due to crypto hacks and breaches have already surpassed $2 billion, and they are projected to set another all-time high.As stated by the World Economic Forum, the use of cryptocurrencies for criminal activities, including ransomware, scams, and terrorism financing, has led to a total loss of $14 billion in 2021, representing a 79% surge from 2020. Thus, it is vital to ensure sufficient crypto security to avoid such severe repercussions.Crypto hardware wallets can be seen as a viable solution to most security issues. These wallets offer a secure way to store private keys using cold storage and provide additional protection against hacking attempts. Since the private keys are kept offline, these wallets provide a safe way to store and manage digital assets, making them a preferred choice among cryptocurrency enthusiasts.Story continuesCrypto Wallets: Hot Vs. Cold StorageThe rise in cryptocurrency theft is a concerning trend. According to Chainalysis, ""2022 was the biggest year ever for crypto hacking, with $3.8 billion stolen from cryptocurrency businesses"".Crypto wallets can play a critical role in this regard, offering an offline storage solution that is less vulnerable to attacks from hackers and malware. Regarding crypto wallets, there are two main types of storage: hot and cold. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, making them more prone to cyber-attacks and other security threats. In contrast, cold storage wallets are kept offline, providing a higher level of security against such vulnerabilities.Hot wallets are typically used for convenience and accessibility, allowing users to quickly access their cryptocurrency holdings from anywhere at any time. However, the trade-off for this convenience is a higher risk of theft or hacking, as hot wallets are connected to the internet and are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks.On the other hand, cold storage wallets provide a more secure option for storing digital assets, as they are kept offline and away from potential threats. It makes them ideal for the long-term storage of cryptocurrency investments or for individuals and businesses requiring higher security for their digital assets.Freezing Out Hackers: Why Cold Storage is the Hottest Trend in Crypto SecurityThe benefits of cold storage crypto include the following:Enhanced security: Cold storage provides extra protection to your cryptocurrency by keeping it offline and inaccessible to hackers and other cyber threats.Protection against hardware failure: In case of hardware failure, cold storage protects your cryptocurrency. Since your cryptocurrency is stored offline, it is not affected by any physical damage that may occur to your hardware wallet or other storage devices.Privacy: Cold storage ensures that your personal information and transaction history are not stored online where hackers or other third parties can potentially access them.Peace of mind: With cold storage, you can know your cryptocurrency is safe and secure, even if you are not actively using it.Long-term storage: For the long-term storage of cryptocurrency, cold storage is quite handy. You can store your cryptocurrency for years without worrying about online threats or the need for constant monitoring.The Role of Public and Private Keys in Crypto WalletsPublic and private keys play an important role in securing these transactions. The public key is a unique digital address used to receive funds, while the private key is a secret code that enables users to access and control their funds. These keys work together in a cryptographic system to ensure the integrity and security of the user's transactions.Types of Crypto Hardware WalletsCrypto hardware wallets come in various forms, including USB drives, smart cards, and other forms of hardware. USB-based wallets are among the most popular types of hardware wallets, offering high level of security while being easy to use. Smart cards are another highly secure and portable hardware wallets, making them ideal for travelers. Other hardware wallets include mobile devices, paper wallets, and even brain wallets that rely on users' memory.Key Factors to Consider When Choosing a Crypto Hardware WalletWhen choosing a crypto hardware wallet, several factors should be considered. These factors include:Security MeasuresCompatibility with Platforms and DevicesUsabilityTransaction FeesSupport and ResourcesCurrency SupportDesign and InterfaceUsers should also look for wallets that offer two-factor authentication and support multi-signature transactions for added security.Recent Advances and Trends in Crypto Wallet TechnologyRecent advances in crypto wallet technology have focused on improving security and usability. One trend is using biometric authentication, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, to replace passwords. Another is the development of decentralized wallets that allow users to retain control over their private keys while providing seamless integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.DeFi caters to a diverse group of users. Forbes reports that DeFi provides much-needed financial services for the 2 billion unbanked individuals worldwide. Others find it convenient as transactions settle much faster, taking only seconds or minutes compared to days for traditional banking systems.Furthermore, using DeFi eliminates the need to involve a bank when sending or borrowing funds. Some users prefer self-custodied digital assets on a blockchain, due to their peer-to-peer operation, providing unrestricted access without limitations imposed by banks or national capital controls.Future Outlook for Crypto Wallets: Opportunities and ChallengesThe future of crypto wallets seems bright, with the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies and the emergence of new DeFi protocols. However, there are also challenges to overcome, including the need for greater interoperability between different blockchains and wallets and better user education to ensure that users understand the importance of securing their private keys. The involvement of giant corporations such as International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), within the cryptocurrency industry can contribute to a promising future outlook for digital asset security, as they have been exploring ways to leverage blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies in their businesses.International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has created the IBM Blockchain platform, which allows businesses to construct and launch blockchain networks, applications, and smart contracts. Moreover, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has contributed to various blockchain-based initiatives, including supply chain management, identity verification, and digital asset management.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been exploring various ways to leverage blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies to improve its products and services, and support the crypto industry's growth. Some of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s initiatives include developing blockchain-based solutions using its Azure cloud platform, and a built-in crypto wallet is reportedly being tested by Microsoft Edge, as reported by CryptoSlate.PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has recently entered the cryptocurrency market by allowing its customers to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash directly through their accounts. So, users can now use their PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) balance to purchase cryptocurrency and use it to purchase from the millions of merchants that accept them.As several mega-corporations are contributing to the growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, a positive impact is expected for crypto security and various industries in the future.Let's now move to the 10 best crypto hardware wallets in 2023.10 Best Crypto Hardware Wallets in 2023Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyOur methodology for identifying the best crypto hardware wallets in 2023 considers factors such as security, user-friendliness, multi-currency support, cost-effectiveness, and durability, based on user preferences for advanced features like offline storage, clear instructions, and intuitive interface.We considered feedback from users on social media platforms, including Reddit and Quora, and reviews from reputable sources like Investopedia, Forbes, CadaNews, and Finder.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the company’s adjusted gross profit margin contracted 410 basis points to 36.8% due to escalated cost inflation, higher other supply-chain expenses and an adverse product mix. Also, McCormick continued to witness supply chain-related issues. The persistence of these headwinds is a worry for the quarter under review.That said, McCormick has been benefiting from its solid acquisitions and the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (“CCI”) program.  McCormick focuses on saving costs and enhancing productivity through its CCI program.On its last earnings call, MKC stated that it anticipates fiscal 2023 to witness a solid underlying business performance, backed by sales growth. It expects the Global Operating Effectiveness Program and the lapping of pandemic-led hurdles to have positively impacted fiscal 2023 operating income, which is likely to be somewhat negated by the impacts of the Kitchen Basics divestiture and a rise in employee incentive compensation costs.Management expects fiscal 2023 sales growth to be fueled by pricing actions, which, along with cost savings, is likely to help it counter inflationary headwinds. The company anticipates seeing solid growth via brand strength, brand marketing, new products, category management and differentiated customer engagement. These factors bode well for the quarter under review.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for McCormick this time.

159,fe41f7a4-2c8f-3327-ae6f-ceed8f84e864,UAL,2023-03-25,35 Most Visited Countries in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/35-most-visited-countries-world-134219283.html,1679665339,STORY,"['UAL', 'DAL', 'AAL']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 35 most visited countries in the world. To skip our detailed analysis of the travel industry, you can go directly to see the 10 most visited countries in the world.When the entire world ground to a halt in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, many industries were devastated but none more so than the hospitality industry. After lockdowns were imposed across most countries, travel came to a complete halt, which initially encompassed both international and domestic travel. From the first quarter of 2020 to the second quarter of 2022, travel restrictions were imposed by most nations and even where travel was allowed, there were a lot of regulations which had to be fulfilled before one could travel, which included some of the most visited countries in the world.In between these two years, there were little pockets which allowed for some level of movement, such as the summer of 2021 when conditions seemed to be getting better, only for the Omicron variant to rear its head and see restrictions imposed once more. However, even in these times, many people preferred not to travel because of various caveats such as registration apps, Covid-19 negative tests, proof of vaccination and many more. Some places even required multiple tests depending on the location and country of origination, while restrictions for different countries were lowered or removed at different points in time considering the threat of the virus spreading from the country of origination.35 most visited countries in the worldPhoto by Cris Tagupa on UnsplashThe tourism industry is one of the biggest industries in the world and accounts for nearly a tenth of the global GDP while providing employment to more than 320 million people across the world. For many countries, tourism actually accounts for a significant proportion of their GDP which suffered massively as a result of the aforementioned lockdowns, including some of the most visited countries in the world. In 2019 alone, more than 1.5 billion people travelled internationally while billions more traveled domestically, though the number saw a massive decline of 72% once the pandemic hit.Story continuesSurprisingly, the restrictions imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic mostly came to an end / were reduced significantly after vaccines were developed by some of the biggest pharmaceutical in the world, on a timescale much faster than anticipated with much more success as well. Because of successful global inoculation which has seen over 5.5 billion receive a Covid-19 vaccine, approximating to over 72% of the world's population, countries were able to open up in early 2022 and pent-up demand for travel saw some of the largest airlines in the world including Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NASDAQ:DAL), American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) to experience large increases in demand. Most of these companies laid of tens of thousands of employees during the pandemic and posted major losses in both 2020 and 2021 while many have also posted a loss in 2022, even as record revenue was earned. This was mainly a result of higher prices rather than volumes as the number of passengers still haven't recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Most airlines started to charge much higher prices for both economy and business class seats, though the latter saw a much greater increase in percentage terms. While many airlines are still some way away from breakeven, United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) did become profitable again in Q2 2022 because of higher demand. When discussing the outlook for 2023, United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) stated in their earnings call for Q4 2022 ""As we think about the revenue outlook for 2023, we are bullish about global long-haul. We expect industry capacity across both the Atlantic and Pacific. The United is the largest carrier to be flattish versus 2019, which provides for an easy setup and positive RASM year-over-year.""International demand remains incredibly strong, and we are looking at the potential for record profits and margins across our global network. Asia has traditionally been a margin drag on our global flying, but we’ve worked diligently to rebuild the network and close this gap. And we think 2023 will validate that we accomplish that goal. Asia is also close to being fully opened, allowing United to reestablish the bulk of the specific flying outside of China. It’s worth noting that restrictions on the use of Russian airspace will constrain United from flying both of our China network in 2023. This same restriction will also limit our ability to fly to India.Of course, airlines aren't the only companies which are reaping the benefits of pent-up demand; hotels are cashing in as well, as tourists have been happy to pay higher prices which has led to higher revenues and profits for some of the largest hotel chains in the world.According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization, some regions in 2023 will see travel return to pre-pandemic levels which is huge news for one of the worst-hit industries by the pandemic. Europe is one of the regions leading the charge for tourism revival and this is expected to continue in 2023 according to the European Travel Commission, building on the foundation established in 2022, which is important considering that several European countries feature on our list of the most visited countries in the world. While long-haul travel is still behind short-haul and medium-haul, the prospects for 2023 still seem encouraging, though Eastern Europe will understandably see much slower growth because of the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war. Other challenges that the travel industry has to face include higher inflation which has hurt disposable income of customers while corporations are also cutting down on travel and face-to-face meetings in a bid to control expenses and deliver higher operating profit growth to shareholders. In Europe, the domestic sector is expected to post a full recovery by 2024 and international travel will recover by 2025. According to the President of the European Travel Commission, ""Looking forward to 2023, we expect the tourism sector in Europe to continue its strong rebound. As European short-haul travel is well on its way to recovery, the tourism industry’s attention has now turned to long-haul arrivals. In welcome news, we can expect the long-awaited return of Asia Pacific visitors in the coming months. As the industry navigates the many challenges it faces this year, it is vital that the sector continues to be receptive to consumer demand, improving the visitor experience at destination and targeting markets and segments less affected by economic slowdown.”To determine our list of the most visited countries in the world, we accessed the dashboard set up by the United Nation World Tourism Organization. Since 2022 statistics haven't been finalized yet, we relied on 2021 data. We checked both the number of visitors for each country and expenditure by tourists in the country in USD, assigning 80% weightage to the former criterion and 20% to the latter. So, let's now take a look at the countries expecting the most tourists in 2023, starting with:35. AndorraNumber of visitors in 2021 (in millions): 1.9One of the biggest attractions of Andorra is the Caldea Spa Center which is a huge natural thermal spring complex which has both indoor and outdoor swimming pools.

BelgiumNumber of visitors in 2021 (in millions): 3.2For anyone visiting Belgium, a trip to Bruges is a must, with the Historic Center of Bruges being designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2000.

161,36777512-4e22-3d9d-ba2c-a006b4f70ab9,PNC,2023-03-25,7 Bank Stocks to Buy on the Dip,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-bank-stocks-buy-dip-201604508.html,1679429764,STORY,"['BAC', 'USB', 'CSGN.SW', 'WFC', 'JPM', 'GSBD', 'HSBC', 'PNC']","[Bank stocks continue to be volatile as professional traders and individual investors try to assess how bad the problems in the sector really are following the collapse of three lenders in the U.S. and the $3.2 billion takeover of Switzerland’s Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) by rival UBS (NYSE:UBS). As the U.S. government steps in to guarantee the deposits at now defunct Silicon Valley Bank, and the largest banks in America inject $30 billion of deposits into troubled lender First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC), investors have been understandably rattled and moved their money out of bank stocks. However, by most accounts, the selloff of bank stocks has been an overreaction. By nearly all accounts, this is not a repeat of the 2008-09 financial crisis. The good news for long-term investors is that many rock-solid bank stocks are now on sale as their share prices have been pushed lower in recent weeks. Here are seven bank stocks to buy on the dip.JPMJPMorgan$127.18GSGoldman Sachs$313.67HSBCHSBC$34.30WFCWells Fargo$37.20BACBank of America$27.64USBUS Bancorp$34.79PNCPNC Financial$124.40JPMorgan Chase (JPM)JPM stock: the JPMorgan logo on top of a buildingSource: ShutterstockLet’s begin with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), which remains the largest U.S. bank by market capitalization. Few banks are as solid today as JPMorgan Chase. Many analysts refer to the lender as having a “fortress balance sheet.” And despite the turmoil of financial markets over the past year, JPMorgan Chase has found a way to continue reporting strong quarterly earnings. The bank’s profit for the fourth and final quarter of 2022 was $11 billion, or $3.57 per share, compared with $10.4 billion, or $3.33 per share, during the same period a year earlier.The revenue of JPMorgan’s investment-banking unit continued to decline in Q4 due to a lack of deals caused by the stock market’s struggles. The investment banking unit’s revenue declined 57% year-over-year last quarter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStory continuesHowever, the lender’s trading revenue grew amid the market volatility as investors repositioned their portfolios to navigate the current high interest-rate environment. Moreover, the bank’s revenue from fixed income trading rose 12% YOY in Q2, .It should come as no surprise that JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is reportedly advising First Republic Bank on its recovery plan given the clout that JPM and its management team have in the global banking sector.Goldman Sachs (GS)In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the backgroundSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comGoldman Sachs’ (NYSE:GS) consumer banking unit, called “Marcus,” got off to a promising start in 2016, but it was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and never recovered. Goldman ultimately lost $3 billion on Marcus, which was rolled into a “platform solutions business” before being shut down and leaving the Wall Street titan with a rare black eye.However, there is every reason to believe that Goldman Sachs will bounce back and return to its winning ways, making it one of the best  bank stocks to buy on the dip. The company has taken decisive steps to right its ship, including cutting more than 3,000 jobs and slashing its annual bonus payments to bankers by 40%.The layoffs have been concentrated in Goldman’s investment banking division, whose corporate deal making has meaningfully slowed over the last year. The bank’s CEO, David Solomon, has said that he will refocus the investment bank on what it does best: making money for corporate clients.HSBC Holdings (HSBC)HSBC logo on corporate buildingSource: ShutterstockInvestors looking for a solid foreign bank outside the U.S. should consider HSBC Bank (NYSE:HSBC). The lender, which began life in Hong Kong and primarily served Asian markets is today based in London and is increasingly focusing on Europe while also trying to break into North America.In fact, HSBC is now the biggest bank in Europe with more than $10 trillion of assets under custody.  While HSBC recently announced that it was exiting Canada after a failed foray into that market, the sale of its Canadian unit will result in a special one-time dividend payment of 21 cents per share to its stockholders.HSBC announced the special dividend payment along with strong fourth-quarter results that showed a profit of $5.2 billion, which was 108% higher than the $2.5 billion of net income that  the bank had recorded a year earlier, and higher than the $4.97 billion that analysts who cover the lender had, on average, expected.Due to the strong Q4 print, HSBC announced a regular dividend payment to shareholders of 40 cents per share, which equates to a yield of 4.72% and is among the highest of any bank.Wells Fargo (WFC)Wells Fargo (WFC) bank sign in yellow and red with wagon logo. The sign is flanked by tall grassSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comU.S. lender Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) made headlines at the start of this year when it announced that it was exiting the multitrillion-dollar U.S. mortgage market. The announcement was a shock given that Wells Fargo was a leader in the U.S. home loan market, managing as much as $201.8 billion of such loans, according to data from Inside Mortgage Finance.The lender said it was getting out of the real estate game due to a combination of onerous regulations and rising interest rates that have dampened the market over the last year.Going forward, Wells Fargo plans to focus exclusively on providing home loans for its rich clients of its wealth-management unit.Additionally, the lender said it was generating more of its revenue from investment banking and credit cards rather than from mortgages and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). While a surprise, Wells Fargo’s exit from the real estate market is not unprecedented. That’s because JPMorgan Chase got out of the mortgage market after the 2008 financial crisis.Wells Fargo announced its exit from the housing sector as it reported disappointing Q$ earnings in January.Bank of America (BAC)bank of america stockSource: PL Gould / Shutterstock.comAnother U.S. lender that is viewed as stable and strong today is Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). The second biggest bank in the U.S. after JPMorgan Chase has come along way since the dark days of the 2008 financial crisis. Between late 2007 and mid-2009, BAC stock declined more than 80%, and, at one point, was trading for just $6 a share and in danger of becoming a penny stock. Fortunately, Bank of America weathered the storm and even purchased financial firm Merrill Lynch coming out of the crisis and is today much healthier than in the past.Along with JPMorgan, Bank of America helped to organize the group of 11 banks that agreed to deposit $30 billion in troubled lender First Republic to help shore-up its finances and rally confidence in the banking sector. Bank of America is thriving under the leadership of CEO Brian Moynihan, who has the lender focused on consumer banking and loans. That strategy helped Bank of America post a Q4 2022 earnings beat despite a sharp downturn in investment banking revenues. BAC stock is down 15% on the year and a definite buy at current levels.US Bancorp (USB)US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is not quite as well known as the four largest lenders in America. However, US Bancorp is the fifth biggest bank in the U.S. based in assets despite being primarily based in the Midwest. Maybe it’s because of its roots in the American heartland, but U.S. Bancorp has largely avoided scandal throughout its nearly 100 years of existence. And many analysts single the bank out for being one of the best managed financial institutions in the country.In particular, bullish analysts point out that US Bancorp has low-cost deposits that other banks can’t match, and more than enough funds on hand to cover potential loan losses. The bank also has limited exposure to troubled foreign lenders such as Credit Suisse.One of US Bancorp’s fans is none other than famed investor Warren Buffett. While he has sold most of his bank stocks in recent years, Buffett continues to own more than 8 million shares of USB stock, worth more than $300 million.PNC Financial Services (PNC)An image of a solar panel in the shape of a piggy bank on a rooftop; concept for solar stocksSource: Andreas Prott / ShutterstockAlso among the 10 biggest U.S. banks with more than $500 billion of assets is PNC Financial Services (NYSE:PNC). Like other lenders, PNC stock has been dragged lower by the current banking troubles and investors’ shaky sentiment. However, by all accounts, PNC Financial remains a sturdy bank that has none of the underlying problems that plagued a number of regional banks in recent weeks. In fact, there were rumors that PNC Financial was going to try to buy Silicon Valley Bank following its collapse. But the bank has ruled out that scenario.The decision to steer clear of Silicon Valley Bank could be a smart one given the financial mess at that institution. PNC’s revenue grew 4% in the final quarter of last year versus the same period a year earlier to $5.76 billion.During Q4, the company also $1.2 billion to shareholders through its generous dividend that pays $1.50 per share each quarter for a yield of 4.55%. Like its peers, PNC stock has been dragged lower due to the current turmoil of the financial sector.As the first quarter nears its end, PNC Financial’s stock is down 21%. Investors should view the decline as a buying opportunity.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in BAC.

RCL is poised to benefit from improvements in booking activities, fleet-expansion efforts and digital initiatives. Also, the emphasis on the optimization of distribution channels bodes well.Shares of Royal Caribbean have surged 40.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 12.9% growth. An upward revision in earnings estimates for 2023 reflects analysts’ optimism regarding the company’s growth potential. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 earnings has moved up 11.6% to $3.27 per share.Factors Driving GrowthRoyal Caribbean has been benefitting from strong demand for cruising, relaxation in COVID-related protocols and acceleration in booking volumes. During the fourth quarter of 2022, booking volumes for 2023 sailings were up from 2019 levels. During the quarter, the company reported solid bookings with respect to North America sailings. The company stated that the cumulative booked position remains within historical ranges. It also reported a rise in pre-cruise onboard purchases (at higher prices) on a year-over-year basis. The company stated benefits from strong direct-to-consumer channels and digital engagement initiatives.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGiven the full fleet resumption and load factors (at approximately 95%), the company expects customer deposits to return to typical seasonality in the upcoming periods. In 2023, the company anticipates solid guest generation from the North America region.On the supply front, the company is steadfast in increasing its capacity to meet rising demand. Moving into 2023, the company has three ships scheduled for delivery — Icon of the Seas, Celebrity Ascent and Silver Nova. The company anticipates the additions to boost its capacity by approximately 14% from 2019 levels. The company anticipates the ship to be significantly accretive to its key financial metrics.Royal Caribbean continues using digital tools for marketing, product development and enhancing the consumer experience. The initiative plays a vital role in supporting the enhancement of customer preference, engagement, cruise frequency, guest experience and spending. The company has introduced new technological capabilities under its Project Excalibur. It has also rolled out a smartphone app to increase convenience and better serve guests. In addition to industry-wide trends, several unique factors are boosting the company’s numbers. Streaming WiFi, expanded onboard offerings, customized destination experiences and other ship upgrades are also paying off. The company emphasizes on enhancing its e-commerce and pre-cruise capabilities and optimizing its distribution channels to drive growth.During the fourth quarter of 2022, the company reported early consumer engagement, with about 60% purchasing onboard experiences before the sailings. This represents double-digit growth in penetration and much higher revenue (related to pre-cruise purchases) from 2019 levels. The company focuses on new innovative ships and onboard experiences to boost its offering and deliver superior yields and margins.Story continuesOther Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are Las Vegas Sands Corp.

167,9e19ce77-fddc-3f5f-8ad4-78c159149705,ADI,2023-03-25,3 Reasons Why Analog Devices (ADI) Is a Great Growth Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-why-analog-devices-164504992.html,1679676304,STORY,['ADI'],"[Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Analog Devices (ADI) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this semiconductor maker a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Analog Devices is 11.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 10.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 4%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Analog Devices is 99%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 38.8%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 26.7% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 11.6%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Analog Devices. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.6% over the past month.Bottom LineAnalog Devices has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Analog Devices is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With talks of an impending recession, everyone is looking for safer options. However, Shelby Davis once famously said, “Invest for the long haul. Don’t get too greedy, and don’t get too scared.”Although stock indexes are lackluster, it’s important to think ahead to the next bull market, regardless of whether it’s imminent or further down the line. Focusing on the future will allow you to prepare your portfolio for the worst-case scenario. It will also position you for success when the market inevitably improves.Selecting the best stocks with potential can be challenging for investors. While some stocks with potential can offer rapid returns as optimism about the future rises, a souring outlook can lead to a significant decline in value. Therefore, it’s recommended that investors opt for proven companies with a track record of expansion and success.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhile past performance does not guarantee future returns, it’s reasonable to assume that companies riding big-picture trends will probably continue growing as long as they persist. By prioritizing proven companies that align with mega-trends, investors can take a responsible approach to buy stocks with potential.EXASExact Sciences$65.53VVisa$219.25CRMSalesforce$185.36Exact Sciences (EXAS)EXACT Sciences Corporation office exterior. EXAS stock.Source: Tada Images / ShutterstockExact Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS), a medical diagnostics firm, is one of the best stocks with potential.The company is addressing a critical and ongoing need in the healthcare industry with its innovative approach. It provides minimally invasive cancer screening and diagnostic tests, essential components of preventative medicine.The addressable market for this type of service is vast, encompassing nearly everyone as a potential customer. As a result, the company consistently achieves sales and profit growth. Because of the demographic shift in the United States towards an aging population, the outlook for increasing demand in the coming years is promising.Story continuesThe company projects its 2023 revenue to fall between $2,265 million and $2,315 million, showing an astounding 683% growth in its top line within five years. This impressive expansion is a testament to the company’s significant progress over the years, with its cancer screening tests gaining widespread acceptance.Despite progress in reducing losses, the company’s financials still present a challenge, with a net loss of $127.7 million, or $0.72 per share, in the fourth quarter, compared to the previous year’s net loss of $220.6 million, or $1.28 per share. This financial setback might give some investors pause, especially given the current bearish market environment.Exact Sciences will only grow from here. With a favorable outlook for secular growth in the years to come, the stock has the potential to emerge as a clear winner in the coming decade if management successfully reduces costs.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V) is legendary in financial services. As a Warren Buffett favorite, the stock regularly receives massive attention among the broader investment community.Currently, Visa’s stock is trading at a PE ratio of 30.4, which is a discount compared to its historical highs. Over the past ten years, Visa’s PE ratio range has been between 19.66 (minimum) and 84.19 (maximum), with a median of 33.07. Therefore, Visa’s current PE ratio is below its historical median, showing it may be undervalued.Why is Visa stock down? Well, there are a couple of factors at play. First, we are seeing a general slowdown in growth and spending, which does not bode well for Visa’s prospects.Secondly, Visa, for the longest time, has commanded a premium in its industry. However, with the markets cooling off, investors are taking less interest in stocks with growth potential. During volatile times, investors pour capital into safer avenues such as utility and dividend stocks. We see the same trend in 2023.That opens up a great opportunity for you to look into Visa. Its latest financials confirm its health and vitality. Visa beat first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings estimates, fueled by a rise in cross-border travel. After adjustments, the company earned $4.6 billion, or $2.18 per share. The revenue generated was $7.9 billion under generally accepted accounting principles.And the growth story is not over.The worldwide trend toward cashless payments has been ongoing for years, but significant growth potential remains, particularly in emerging markets. Accounting firm PwC Global estimates that cashless payment volumes could double globally by 2030.Despite the highly competitive nature of the payments industry, Visa, as the market leader, is likely to grow along with the industry.Salesforce (CRM)lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco.

As the industry’s gold standard, Salesforce holds an outstanding position in this field.Salesforce’s position as the industry leader in customer relationship management makes it the preferred choice for new market entrants. Existing customers have greater revenue potential with ongoing product features and pricing enhancements. This established market dominance makes it highly improbable for any firm to challenge Salesforce’s position anytime soon.However, the pressure has been increasing on Salesforce lately. The cloud software pioneer is under increasing pressure to prioritize profitability, leading to the departure of several executives.This is a common occurrence at the end of an era, which, in this case, is the end of the easy-money economic policy era. The US Federal Reserve’s hawkish interest rate hikes aimed at combating inflation contributed to this shift.Salesforce’s potential for growth warrants its inclusion in this list of stocks with potential, despite modest profits alongside strong revenue growth.

Shares have added about 14.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Nvidia due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.NVIDIA Q4 Earnings and Sales Top Estimates, Down YoYNVIDIA reported better-than-anticipated results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein both the bottom line and the top line surpassed  the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the quarterly earnings and revenues, each declined significantly on a year-over-year basis.For the fourth quarter, NVIDIA reported non-GAAP earnings of 88 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.6%. Moreover, the reported figure plunged 33.3% year over year while increasing 51.7% sequentially. The year-over-year decline in earnings was mainly due to lower revenues and increased operating expenses.Fourth-quarter revenues plunged 20.8% year over year while climbing 2% sequentially to $6.05 billion, primarily because of continued weakness across its Gaming, Professional Visualization, OEM and Other market segments. However, the top line beat the consensus mark of $6.01 billion.Segment DetailsNVIDIA reports revenues under two segments — Graphics and Compute &amp; Networking.Graphics includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and personal computers, the GeForce NOW game-streaming service and related infrastructure. The segment also offers solutions for gaming platforms, Quadro GPUs for enterprise design, GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.Graphics accounted for 39.3% of fiscal fourth-quarter revenues. The segment’s top line plunged 46% year over year while increased 12% sequentially to $2.38 billion.Story continuesCompute &amp; Networking represented 60.7% of fiscal fourth-quarter revenues. The segment comprises Data Center platforms and systems for artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, the DRIVE development platform for autonomous vehicles and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.Compute &amp; Networking revenues soared 14% year over year to $3.67 billion. However, the segment’s revenues declined 4% sequentially.Market Platform’s Top Line DetailsBased on the market platform, Gaming revenues plunged 46% year over year while going up by 16% sequentially to $1.83 billion and accounted for 30.3% of total revenues. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to a lower sell-in of Gaming products. This reflected a reduction in channel partner inventory levels amid weak demand due to macroeconomic headwinds and lockdowns in China, which weighed on consumer demand.Revenues from Data Center (59.8% of revenues) jumped 11% year over year but slashed 6% from the previous quarter to $3.62 billion. This year-over-year rise was driven by the strong demand for its chips across U.S. cloud service providers, consumer internet companies and other vertical industries, while the sequential change reflected lower sales in China.Professional Visualization revenues (3.7% of revenues) decreased 65% year over year but increased 13% sequentially to $226 million. The decline was primarily due to a lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with the current demand expectations.Automotive sales (4.9% of revenues) in the reported quarter totaled $294 million, up 135% on a year-over-year basis and 17% sequentially. The increase was mainly driven by the increased revenue contribution from self-driving solutions, computing solutions for electric vehicle makers, strength in sales of AI cockpit solutions and growth in automotive development arrangements.OEM and Other revenues (1.4% of revenues) plunged 56% year over year while rising 15% sequentially to $84 million. The decline was mainly due to the weak performance of Cryptocurrency Mining Processors, which generated nominal sales in the quarter compared with the year-ago quarter. Moreover, lower notebook OEM sales also negatively impacted the overall unit’s performance in the fourth quarter.Operating DetailsNVIDIA’s non-GAAP gross margin contracted by 90 basis points (bps) year over year to 66.1%, mainly due to lower Gaming margins and a higher contribution from Automotive, partially offset by a higher contribution from Data Center.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 23% year over year and down 1% sequentially to $1.78 billion on higher compensation-related expenses associated with employee growth and increased data center infrastructure-related expenses.The non-GAAP operating income slumped 40% year over year to $2.22 billion.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAs of Jan 29, 2023, NVDA’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $13.30 billion, up from $13.14 billion as of Oct 30, 2022.As of Jan 29, 2023, the total long-term debt (including current maturities) was $9.70 billion, down from the previous quarter’s $10.95 billion.NVIDIA generated $2.25 billion in operating cash flows, down from the year-ago quarter’s $3.03 billion but up from the previous quarter’s $392 million.The free cash flow was an inflow of $1.74 billion compared with year-ago quarter’s $2.74 billion and the previous quarter’s outflow of $156 million.In the full fiscal 2023, the company generated operating and free cash flows of $5.64 billion and $3.75 billion, respectively.In the fourth quarter, the company returned $1.15 billion to shareholders through dividend payouts and share repurchases. In fiscal 2023, NVIDIA paid out $10.44 billion in dividends and common stocks. At the end of the quarter, it had a remaining share-repurchase authorization of $7.23 billion through December 2023.NVIDIA announced a quarterly cash dividend of 4 cents per share payable on Mar 29, 2023, to the shareholders of record on Mar 8, 2023.GuidanceFor the first quarter of fiscal 2024, NVIDIA anticipates revenues of $6.50 billion (+/-2%).The GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are projected at 64.1% and 66.5%, respectively (+/-50 bps). GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated at $2.53 billion and $1.78 billion, respectively.GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, are anticipated at approximately $50 million.The GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter is estimated at 13% (+/- 1%).The company projects to make capital expenditures between $350 million and $400 million during the quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresCurrently, Nvidia has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

(OKE) lately with too much selling pressure. The stock has declined 13.7% over the past four weeks. However, given the fact that it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts are majorly in agreement about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier, the stock could be due for a turnaround.Here is How to Spot Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Here's Why OKE Could Experience a TurnaroundThe RSI reading of 28.35 for OKE is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.3-month RSI Chart for OKEThe RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for OKE has increased 13.1%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, OKE currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises.

The initiative was announced by Universal Pictures President Peter Cramer.""Through the Sustainable Production Program, we have been working for more than a decade to reduce environmental impact on our sets. UFEG is now expanding its commitment to sustainability starting as early as the development phase,"" said Cramer. ""Across the filmmaking process, we will apply an inclusive strategy to increasing our sustainability efforts and continuing to do better on all fronts.""Unique amongst studios, every greenlight package will include a film's sustainability plan, ensuring that sustainability is built into the planning process from the beginning including script development, locations and set needs, as well as on-screen behaviors. The program was built in partnership between the UFEG Film Strategy team and the NBCUniversal Sustainability Department and is an expansion of the existing Sustainable Production Program, which already tackles issues such as food and set material donations, fuel reduction and energy efficiency.UFEG is already working with its key filmmakers and talent who are passionate about sustainability. Additionally, the Studio has partnered with nonprofit organizations like the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and its ""Rewrite the Future"" program, which has informed the Studio's strategy around climate storytelling and ensured that its efforts are driven by science.

Gameplay involves players looking through a series of stylized photos based on scenes from the movie to identify which have hidden ""bugs."" (Renfield, Dracula's assistant and the focus of the movie, apparently eats insects during the film to give himself superpowers.)After players successfully identify the bugs is when Aptos comes into play. Users are entered in a digital raffle with the chance to win three digital collectibles, which include movie posters and comic book scenes from the film. And those unlucky enough to fail to find the clandestine bugs still receive a collectible. These non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are minted on the Aptos blockchain and users can access them through Petra, a wallet built by Aptos.“We know audiences just want to be connected. They want story, and fun, and no barriers to connecting with their fandom,” Greg Reed, vice president of technology partnerships at Universal Pictures, said in a statement. “Our job is to leverage high-performing, scalable networks.""NBCUniversal's partnership with Aptos Labs marks the media giant's first major foray into Web3, according to Mo Shaikh, cofounder and CEO of Aptos Labs. And it's yet another coup for the fledgling blockchain developer as it continues to notch high-profile partnerships for its protocol less than a year and a half after it went live.""This partnership was really born out of a shared interest of exploring Web3 and blockchain technology to really enhance the fan experience,"" Shaikh told Fortune.Shaikh and cofounder Avery Ching publicly released the Aptos blockchain in October 2022. They had previously been at Meta (formerly Facebook) working on Diem (formerly Libra), the social media titan's stablecoin project that was scuttled in January 2022 as it met significant resistance from lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. and Europe.Story continuesFollowing the collapse of Diem, Shaikh and Ching, who were specifically working on Diem's stablecoin wallet, set off on their own and used tech from their days at Meta to create Aptos, a layer-1 blockchain secured by proof of stake.Despite its questionable token drop, Aptos soon took off. Its token APT has a market capitalization of approximately $2.35 billion as of late Thursday afternoon. The blockchain boasts some of the highest transaction speeds among protocols, per crypto research firm Messari. And in addition to NBCUniversal, Aptos Labs has announced partnerships with Google Cloud as well as MoonPay, the fintech firm that builds crypto payments infrastructure.""We,"" Shaikh told Fortune, ""don't plan to just stop with just NBCUniversal and this film.""This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

Yet, investors should try to look beyond the jitters and remember that the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are still trading solidly above their recent SVB collapse lows.Even with the recent swings and big moves, the benchmark is up about 4% YTD and the Nasdaq has jumped around 13%. And despite the fears, the VIX (CBOE Volatility Index) remains way below where it was in October and at various stages last year.The S&amp;P 500 is currently trading between its 200-day and 50-day moving averages, while the tech-heavy index remains above both. Investors should also note that the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq already experienced a so-called golden cross in 2023. This bullish technical indicator occurs when the shorter-term moving average crosses above the long-term trend.  Wall Street is growing more convinced that the Fed is near the end of its rate hike efforts. Plus, traders are now betting that Jay Powell and the Fed will start lowering rates by as early as its June FOMC meeting, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.All of this is to say that investors might want to keep buying stocks even though the market waters are choppy right now.Today we dig into two highly-ranked Zacks stocks from different areas of the economy that offer investors solid outlooks and reasonable valuations, which is key as technology stocks get a bit overheated again. Both stocks have also easily outperformed the market over the last decade.United Rentals (URI) United Rentals (URI) is a global rental equipment powerhouse, and its positive earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now, alongside its overall “A” VGM grade. The firm posted impressive results and provided upbeat guidance earlier this year, with its consensus EPS estimate 12% higher for 2023 and up 10% for 2024.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchURI has been able to lift its prices along with inflation, while benefiting from its bolstered reach and portfolio after it completed its Ahern Rentals acquisition in late 2022. The company offers a wide array of large and small equipment for clients ranging from utility firms and construction companies to homebuilders and homeowners. Alongside its core rental business, United Rentals sells used equipment, which is especially appealing during times of economic uncertainty.Story continuesUnited Rentals in late January announced the restart of its share repurchase program and introduce a dividend. These moves highlight URI’s stability and financial firepower. Zacks estimates call for URI’s sales to climb 20% in 2023 and another 4% in 2024 against a difficult-to-compete-against period. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to surge by 29% and 9%, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchURI has surged 570% in the past 10 years to crush the S&amp;P 500’s 155% and the Zacks construction sector’s 103%, which includes a 300% run off its covid selloff lows. Plus, United Rentals has pulled back significantly after it soared to fresh highs in early March. URI is currently trading 23% below its records and is floating near oversold RSI levels. The drawdown, coupled with its improved earnings outlook, has URI trading at a 50% discount to its own decade-long and 15% under its median at 8.9X forward 12-month earnings.ICF International, Inc. (ICFI)ICF International (ICFI) is a global consulting and digital services provider that works with both the private and public sectors. ICF boasts a strong backlog and it operates in high-growth areas of the economy such as IT modernization/digitization, energy efficiency, environmental and infrastructure services, public health, and beyond.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchICF boasts contracts with extremely reliable and massive clients such as the U.S. Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency. Federal and state, as well as local government clients and its commercial energy work, represented around 85% of ICF’s fourth quarter revenue. Plus, the consulting giant landed record contract wins in 2022, with a large chunk marking new business. ICF closed last year with a business development pipeline worth over $8.5 billion, up 20% YoY.ICF’s improving earnings outlook helps it grab a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the moment. Zacks estimates call for the company’s revenue to climb 11% in both 2023 and 2024 (on top of 15% in FY22) to reach $2.19 billion. Meanwhile, ICF’s adjusted earnings are projected to jump 9% and 11%, respectively. This consistent and strong top and bottom-line growth helps highlight the benefits of its robust offerings and government clients, who rarely have the need to cut back. And ICF pays a dividend.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchICFI shares have climbed roughly 290% in the last 10 years vs. the benchmark’s 155%. More recently, ICFI is up 20% over the trailing 24 months, with the market now roughly sideways. ICFI stock is up 6% YTD and it still trades 29% below its average Zacks price target. IFC was trading around 12% below its October record on Friday. The stock also trades at a 10% discount to the S&amp;P 500 and 30% under its Zacks econ sector. Plus, ICF offers 20% value to its own 10-year highs and matches its median at 16.3X forward earnings. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

198,85b83290-2dc5-3b81-8945-0007ce23ae9a,URI,2023-03-25,"Is United Rentals (URI) a Solid Growth Stock? 3 Reasons to Think ""Yes""",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-rentals-uri-solid-growth-164504416.html,1679676304,STORY,['URI'],"[Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends United Rentals (URI) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this equipment rental company a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for United Rentals is 16.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 29% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 3.5%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for United Rentals is 25.9%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 9.4%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 14.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 10.9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for United Rentals. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.5% over the past month.Bottom LineUnited Rentals has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that United Rentals is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Notably, KBR is the only independent global licensor of acetic acid technology.Doug Kelly, KBR’s Technology unit president, said, ""As the only independently available acetic acid technology in the global market today, KBR's Acetica enables clients to monetize captured carbon through the production of sustainable, high-value products used in our daily lives.""Shares of the company grew 0.31% on Mar 23 and 18.2% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 26.2% growth. Earnings estimates for 2023, which moved up by a cent in the past seven days, reflect a 5.5% year-over-year increase. The trend is likely to continue, given the solid backlog level (including award options). Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research KBR’s solid backlog and option level of $19.8 billion (as of Dec 31, 2022) accentuate its underlying strength. In 2022, KBR received $8.2 billion of bookings and options in highly strategic areas, with a 1.2X trailing 12-month book-to-bill. Going forward, KBR expects broad-based growth across both segments.KBR has been a leader in process technology development, commercialization and plant design for more than 50 years. The determination to lower emissions, achieve product diversification and energy efficiency, as well as develop more sustainable technologies and solutions, have been driving KBR’s performance.In February, KBR launched Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) technology in alliance with Swedish Biofuels AB. The technology processes ethanol and converts carbon dioxide and synthesis gas to SAF, thereby helping KBR's clients utilize captured carbon toward a cleaner, greener future.The demand for the company’s technologies across ammonia for food production, olefins for non-single-use plastics, refining for product diversification and more green solutions to meet tighter environmental standards has been going strong. A strategic shift to IP-enabled maintenance is also gaining traction and KBR’s advisory portfolio continues to see increasing activity, particularly in the energy transition.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, KBR carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

200,42471909-dfdb-3ebd-85f3-11cfcb16ec53,ORCL,2023-03-25,How AI will change the way we work,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ai-going-change-way-100509310.html,1679738709,VIDEO,"['GOOG', 'GOOGL', 'ORCL', 'MSFT', 'ARKK', 'TSLA']","[Generative AI, augmented intelligence, machine learning- these topics have dominated the conversation around tech in 2023, and by now we’ve all heard the rumors: AI is coming for your job, it will take your family, and it will eat the food off your dinner plate, but is there any truth behind this?To find out more, we went to the ground floor of the new tech sector, where technology meets culture, and the South meets the Southwest.Webster’s dictionary defines AI as “the simulation of human behavior in computers”. Sounds harmless right? But with the exploding popularity of generative chat bots like ChatGPT, many people are reexamining where they stand on the technological food chain.Ian Beacraft is one of the leading voices in deep tech and AI. His company, Signal and Cipher, teaches large companies how to adapt to new technology.“Generative ai is here. it's in everyone's palms and it's not going anywhere,” says Ian, telling Yahoo Finance that we’ve only scratched the surface of what AI can do.“We are at the very beginning of one of the biggest revolutions in knowledge work in human history and a lot of people look at this as a large step change in the way that we do our work… what we're doing is we are digitizing skills the same way that we mechanized physical labor in the industrial revolution… we're doing things at a scale, at a volume, and at a breadth that human minds aren't really capable of.”So, will the rise of AI lead to job losses? And if so, why should we embrace this technology?We met with Garry Kasparov, the former chess Grandmaster and Avast Security Ambassador, famous for his series of chess matches against the 1980’s supercomputer, “Deep Blue”.“Every new technology in the past has threatened jobs, actually destroyed jobs, destroyed industry before creating new opportunities,” Kasparov told us.“AI is not the exception. Machines made us stronger in the past, made us faster in the past… so, many jobs we are doing today, in my view, are like zombie jobs. They're already dead. They just don't know yet.”Story continuesSo far, our experts have not painted a particularly rosy picture for the future of mankind, so we went directly to the source. You know what they say- keep your enemies close.According to ChatGPT,“Artificial intelligence has the potential to greatly impact the future of humanity in both positive and negative ways. On the positive side, AI has the potential to improve many aspects of our lives, such as healthcare, education, and transportation.”That doesn’t sound too bad, but it goes on:“One major concern is that as AI systems become more advanced, they may become difficult to control, potentially leading to unintended consequences or even catastrophic outcomes.”Therein lies the concern, and why many in the tech industry are approaching AI with a good deal of caution.“People are getting freaked out. They’re saying ‘Hey, what is this thing? Can we trust it?’”“I see both sides of the argument. and, you know, in some ways, there is a lot of opportunity, but on the other hand, we also have to be careful, just like with any technology,” says Pulkit Agrawal, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at MIT.Instead of thinking of AI as a replacement for human beings, according to Pulkit, we should think of AI as a tool.Like the invention of the PC, artificial intelligence may actually improve our work and make humans more efficient in performing our day-to-day tasks.“If an AI system can look at CT scans, and make a diagnosis, is it going to replace a doctor or not? I would say no. I think the right way to implement the system is to make the system be an advisor to a doctor, because this AI system has looked at more CT scans than any doctor could have looked in his life,” Pulkit says.While the possibilities for AI may seem limitless, it could be the key to unlocking the potential of the human brain.More Yahoo Finance coverage here:At SXSW 2023, dealmaking carries on against banking crisis backdropThe surprising companies one firm thinks will benefit from the AI 'tidal wave'US Copyright Office opens door to protecting AI-assisted works]"

With higher Treasury yields, capital has moved from the broader equity market into the U.S. Treasury market and the valuations of many leading dividend stocks are arguably lower than what they would have been as a result.In terms of interest rates, the Federal Reserve on March 22 raised interest rates by 25 basis points to bring the benchmark funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%.After the interest rate raise, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said, ""We believe, however, that events in the banking system over the past two weeks are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which would in turn affect economic outcomes. It is too soon to determine the extent of these effects, and therefore too soon to tell it how monetary policy should respond. As a result, we no longer state that we anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate to quell inflation. Instead, we now anticipate that some additional policy firming may be appropriate.""Story continuesWith the Federal Reserve Chairman's comments, the broader markets declined on March 22 as the market didn't like Powell's commentary on credit conditions. Recently, Deutsche Bank stock has declined on March 24 as its credit default swaps have increased. Given Deutsche Bank is a huge bank, any substantial financial difficulties Deutsche Bank faces could affect the global economy if regulators don't do enough to contain the situation.Given the economic outcomes could be negative, an economic slowdown could also negatively affect leading dividend stocks. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.chrisdorney/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 13 Best Long Term Dividend Stocks to Buy Now, we chose 13 stocks that have competitive advantages and growth potential in the long term that also pay a dividend.We ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q4.For those of you interested, check out 14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.13 Best Long Term Dividend Stocks to Buy Now13.

204,ccaf5df5-a2b2-3fd5-a2fb-381bf0697ad0,PSA,2023-03-25,The 3 Best REITs to Buy Now for Passive Income,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-reits-buy-now-164122870.html,1679416882,STORY,"['PSA', 'PLD', 'BXMT']","[If you are looking to tap into a new source of funds for retirement, then real estate investment trusts (REITs) are a popular way to build a reliable passive income stream. REITs generate cash flow through rent or sales, and legally must pass on the majority of their profits to shareholders as dividends.The difficult part is that like anything else in the stock market, not all companies are created equal. So here’ll we’ll analyze three of the best REITs to consider adding to your portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPublic Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comPublic Storage (NYSE:PSA) is one of my top picks, as it’s considered a leader in the self-storage market. The company has large physical positions in real estate throughout America, including 200 million square feet of space in 40 states.To make things better, Public Storage has also been expanding its reach aggressively for the last few years, and this is shown in how quickly its total assets have grown. They have swelled 23% to over $7.4 billion in new investments.When it comes to income, the stock is no laggard either. Its operating cash flow is around $2.4 billion and has total liquidity standing at $1 billion. Its payout ratio stands at 52%, thus giving it a 4% yield and a $3 quarterly dividend amount.Prologis (PLD)The Prologis (PLD) logo displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comPrologis (NYSE:PLD) owns logistics centers all through the United States, Europe and parts of Asia. Its portfolio mainly consists of warehouses and other industrial complexes it then rents out to other, blue-chip companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or the United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). Another angle it pursues for growth is the fact that it can continue to add more square feet of space to increase its income further. What I like the most about Prologis is the fact that it seems very efficient and capable of growing a small investment of shareholder value into a much larger one. Its return on equity of around 6% is proof of this.Story continuesThe news keeps getting better when one considers that it has increased its dividend consecutively for the past five years and has a sustainable payout ratio. Its yield stands at 2.93% and it has a quarterly dividend amount of 87 cents.Blackstone Mortgage Trust (BXMT)A sign for Blackstone (BX) hangs on a white wall.Source: Isabelle OHara / Shutterstock.comFinally, there’s Blackstone Mortgage Trust (NYSE:BXMT), which is a viable option if you are comfortable stepping your toes into the world of mortgage REITs. The good news is that this REIT goes hand in hand with Blackstone (NYSE:BX), which is one of the most respected commercial real estate companies in the world when it comes down to the number of assets on its books.Since BXMT’s business focuses on loans, it’s inherently more risky than other REITs that have a physical baseline such as Prologis or Public Storage. This risk also means that it’s more cyclical in nature, particularly affected by macroeconomic forces such as rising interest rates.Still, there are aspects of BXMT that make it an excellent addition to an investor’s portfolio for passive income. The company’s dividend yield is a whopping 13.97% and also pays out a quarterly dividend amount of 62 cents.On the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This move comes as investors look ahead to its second quarter earnings release. That's set to come next week. Shares this morning, though, they are down by about 6/10 of a percent. So this has been a big mover as well as some of the semi names over the course of the week.I was even tracking Nvidia earlier on this week, and even that, we've got pulled up on our YFi Interactive past five days. Nvidia holding onto gains of about 5%. And then even over that past five days, as we've been kind of taking a look at the broader sector, just tracking the SOX the FELIX semiconductor sector, that's been up by about 2% over the past five days. You've got the heat map here pulled up for the semis.JARED BLIKRE: Yes, and I was just-- we were just talking about things getting better in the US, potentially, and the chip sector is highly levered to the US business cycle. Here, you can see Nvidia up 5%. Guess what it's up year to date? It is up 84%. It is a leader among this group. And let me just switch the time period to show you there. There we go. Nvidia up 84%. I'm going to sort by performance-- AMD, 53%; GlobalFoundries, 28%.This is a very cyclical group, and so it's good to see these particular stocks leading the way here. How much room is there to go? As I was pointing out earlier, the NASDAQ itself up against some potential resistance in that historical trading range. I don't know how much farther can these stocks go in the interim if they're a little bit overbought now, hard to say. But over the longer-term trajectory, these are going to be the leaders if and when things turn around.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, it's a considerable move. And I know we keep focusing on it Nvidia, and Nvidia did have a huge conference, of course, that took place this week, which really reaccelerates so much for the industry of the conversation around what AI could mean for Cloud. DGX Cloud-- we heard about that initially on the artificial intelligence front on Nvidia's earnings call this most recent quarter.Story continuesAnd so now, for the rest of the industry that's trying to wrap their heads or their own growth ambition around how they can integrate artificial intelligence with into each of their cloud offerings or suites data center suites as well, I think that's where investors might be getting a little bit more optimistic and hopefully not kind of ahead of the skis, but at least staying ahead of what the trade might be, just anticipating where this is going to get rolled out to some of those customers, client bases, and portfolio--JARED BLIKRE: We've just got to get rid of these bad banking headlines, and people can focus rightfully on AI and ChatGPT all over again.BRAD SMITH: Well, AI would naturally say that you should just be talking about me anyway, right?JARED BLIKRE: Exactly, yeah.]"
208,4574c6b4-af23-3928-974a-df795ae0ba44,FIS,2023-03-25,Here's What Fidelity National's (FIS) '23 Payments Report Says,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-fidelity-nationals-fis-23-165504367.html,1679676904,STORY,['FIS'],"[Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. FIS recently unveiled that account-to-account (A2A) payments hold promising growth prospects in its “The Worldpay from FIS Global Payments Report 2023”. The report holds an expanding number of real-time payment (RTP) systems across the globe responsible for the boost in A2A payments last year.In 2022, the existence of around 70 RTP schemes extended swift payment rails and led to A2A payments contributing a massive chunk of $525 billion to global e-commerce transaction value. The contribution registered an increase of 13% in 2022 from the 2021 figure of $463 billion.Similar to the widespread adoption observed across the world, A2A payments remain quite popular in the United States as well. Such payments accounted for 9% of e-commerce transaction value in 2022, which is anticipated to rise to 11% by 2026. The likely launch of FedNow, the real-time payments network of the Federal Reserve, in July 2023 is likely to lead to increased consumer cases, which in turn, is anticipated to spur growth in A2A payments.Benefits of A2A PaymentsThe A2A payment method is quite common while making business-to-business (B2B) and person-to-person (P2P) payments. But the FIS report states that A2A payments are increasingly undertaken in person-to-business (P2B) payments. The growing popularity can be attributed to the widespread benefits offered through such payments.A2A payments are transferred directly from the bank account of a consumer to a merchant’s account without an intermediary such as debit or credit cards. This, in turn, brings down the cost of payment acceptance for merchants, settles funds in near real-time and boosts the cash flow. Consumers might be lured to opt for more A2A payments as certain merchants extend incentive benefits for A2A payments. On top of this, consumers benefit from a speedy, safe and seamless checkout experience on selecting A2A payments.Booming E-Commerce MarketThe FIS report further underlines the tremendous growth scope of the global e-commerce market. Despite looming fears of inflation and economic slowdown, the market is likely to hit around $8.5 trillion by 2026. Ever since the onset of the COVID pandemic, digitization was infused in every sphere of life and consumers preferred shopping online in the comfort of their homes. Thereby, the usage of cash witnessed a downfall and flexible online payment methods came to the forefront.Story continuesIn the United States, though consumers still remain inclined toward debit and credit cards, digital wallets emerged as the single leading payment method among online shoppers in 2022 for the first time. Digital wallets made up 32% of e-commerce transaction value in the United States last year.FIS pursues significant investments in innovative technologies and solutions to upgrade the payments infrastructure and such efforts bode well amid a rapidly expanding digital economy.Shares of Fidelity National have lost 26.4% year to date against the industry’s 2.8% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFidelity National currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Business Services space are ICF International, Inc.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now. Investing in the stock market is all about timing. Make the right call at the right time and you'll see your money grow, but fail to read the winds and there are chances of losing an equal amount as well. This basic principle is behind one of the more important theories in investment which are called portfolio diversification. While retail investors typically just buy stocks on the go, professionals are taught mathematical techniques to balance out their portfolios. These techniques include calculating the covariances and the variances of individual stocks within a portfolio to determine the variance of the entire collection of stocks.However, what if you didn't want to go through all this complicated math? After all, if your portfolio has fifty stocks, then you have to calculate the aforementioned metrics for each security and then regularly update the data to keep abreast of the current situation. Well, in that case, you'll have to trust your gut. The gut is a strong and underrated investment weapon, and if wisely used, can potentially make luck work in your favor. One segment of stocks that is quite important these days especially given the market turmoil, is the cyclical sector.In simple terms, cyclical stocks are those that see their fortunes rise and fall with the broader economy. As consumers see their incomes rise due to gross domestic product (GDP) growth, they have more money to spend on products and services. So naturally, cyclical companies are those that see their revenue, and the corresponding share price go up when the economy is doing well. On the flip side, should there be a slowdown, as is feared these days, then their revenues drop and the share price goes down as well.Today's market conditions merit a closer look at cyclical stocks since the U.S. economy is facing rather historic challenges. The Federal Reserve has been in a valiant fight since last year to control inflation by raising interest rates. However, this decision has proven to have a variety of painful outcomes. Out of these, the most devastating took place earlier this month when SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) collapsed (see biggest bankruptcies in US history). Its collapse was caused by two primary reasons, both of which are interrelated. The bank had invested heavily in long term bonds at a time when the Fed's return rates were low, and then when the rates went up, these securities lost their value on the market, and SVB incurred massive losses. These left it unable to keep adequate funds and the bank was taken over by regulators instead.Story continuesSVB's collapse is related directly to cyclical stocks. This is due to the fact that the bank's failure should cause some concern about an aggressive interest rate hiking cycle - a tool that is argued to be crucial in the Fed's inflation fight. However, high interest rates also slow down growth, and if you're reading carefully, then as we pointed out above, slowing growth impacts cyclical stocks. This then creates the perfect opportunity to buy, since anything that goes down, comes up as well in the stock market. Of course, a stock purchase decision should be made after careful thought and consultation with licensed professionals.Unlike other stock market sectors such as energy and basic materials, the cyclical sector consists of a wide variety of firms that cover industries such as electronic commerce firms, car manufacturers, hotels, and distributors. The one common thing across all these categories is that they are sensitive to consumer spending - hence the broader classification as 'cyclical.'Today, we'll look at some of the top cyclical stocks, with the notable picks being Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).biggest eCommerce websites in the worldKen Wolter / Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe started off our search by narrowing down the stocks classified as cyclical.

211,ccaf5df5-a2b2-3fd5-a2fb-381bf0697ad0,PLD,2023-03-25,The 3 Best REITs to Buy Now for Passive Income,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-reits-buy-now-164122870.html,1679416882,STORY,"['PSA', 'PLD', 'BXMT']","[If you are looking to tap into a new source of funds for retirement, then real estate investment trusts (REITs) are a popular way to build a reliable passive income stream. REITs generate cash flow through rent or sales, and legally must pass on the majority of their profits to shareholders as dividends.The difficult part is that like anything else in the stock market, not all companies are created equal. So here’ll we’ll analyze three of the best REITs to consider adding to your portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPublic Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comPublic Storage (NYSE:PSA) is one of my top picks, as it’s considered a leader in the self-storage market. The company has large physical positions in real estate throughout America, including 200 million square feet of space in 40 states.To make things better, Public Storage has also been expanding its reach aggressively for the last few years, and this is shown in how quickly its total assets have grown. They have swelled 23% to over $7.4 billion in new investments.When it comes to income, the stock is no laggard either. Its operating cash flow is around $2.4 billion and has total liquidity standing at $1 billion. Its payout ratio stands at 52%, thus giving it a 4% yield and a $3 quarterly dividend amount.Prologis (PLD)The Prologis (PLD) logo displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comPrologis (NYSE:PLD) owns logistics centers all through the United States, Europe and parts of Asia. Its portfolio mainly consists of warehouses and other industrial complexes it then rents out to other, blue-chip companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or the United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). Another angle it pursues for growth is the fact that it can continue to add more square feet of space to increase its income further. What I like the most about Prologis is the fact that it seems very efficient and capable of growing a small investment of shareholder value into a much larger one. Its return on equity of around 6% is proof of this.Story continuesThe news keeps getting better when one considers that it has increased its dividend consecutively for the past five years and has a sustainable payout ratio. Its yield stands at 2.93% and it has a quarterly dividend amount of 87 cents.Blackstone Mortgage Trust (BXMT)A sign for Blackstone (BX) hangs on a white wall.Source: Isabelle OHara / Shutterstock.comFinally, there’s Blackstone Mortgage Trust (NYSE:BXMT), which is a viable option if you are comfortable stepping your toes into the world of mortgage REITs. The good news is that this REIT goes hand in hand with Blackstone (NYSE:BX), which is one of the most respected commercial real estate companies in the world when it comes down to the number of assets on its books.Since BXMT’s business focuses on loans, it’s inherently more risky than other REITs that have a physical baseline such as Prologis or Public Storage. This risk also means that it’s more cyclical in nature, particularly affected by macroeconomic forces such as rising interest rates.Still, there are aspects of BXMT that make it an excellent addition to an investor’s portfolio for passive income. The company’s dividend yield is a whopping 13.97% and also pays out a quarterly dividend amount of 62 cents.On the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Shares have lost about 7.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is NetApp due for a breakout?

The company projected revenues in the range of $1.525-$1.675 billion. The downtick was caused by a weakening IT spending environment and cloud cost optimization. Apart from that, increased budget scrutiny, leading to smaller deal sizes and extended selling cycles acted as a dampener. Revenues missed the consensus mark by 5.6%.The company tweaked its guidance for fiscal 2023 amid ongoing global macro turmoil and weak IT spending.NetApp now expects fiscal 2023 revenues to be flat year over year. Earlier, NetApp had projected revenue growth of 2-4%The company now anticipates non-GAAP earnings for fiscal 2023 to be between $5.30 and $5.50 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 earnings is pegged at $5.41 per share.For fiscal 2023, NetApp expects non-GAAP gross margin to be 66-67% and non-GAAP operating margin to be 23-24%.Top-Line DetailsThe company introduced two segments for financial reporting, namely, Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud.The Hybrid Cloud segment consists of revenues from the company’s enterprise datacenter business, which include product, support and professional services.The Public Cloud segment consists of revenues from products, which are delivered as-a-service and include related support.

The plan is the least-cost option to continue to serve LG&amp;E and KU customers' energy needs responsibly, reliably and affordably. Additional details regarding LG&amp;E and KU's generation replacement strategy can be found on the utilities' website at www.lge-ku.com/future.""We followed a well-defined and rigorous process to ensure delivery of safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customers. We're confident that our plan exceeds the standards set out by this new law and is the best path forward for our customers. We look forward to continuing to engage with stakeholders in Kentucky and completing the process before the KPSC to demonstrate why that is,"" said Vince Sorgi, PPL President and CEO.The new law requires LG&amp;E and KU to file a request for approval to retire fossil-fuel-fired electric generating units with 30-days' notice and 180 days for the KPSC to issue a decision on the filing. As a result, the company does not expect the new law to impact the timing of a KPSC decision on LG&amp;E and KU's December generation replacement filings, which is expected by November 6, 2023.Story continuesPPL also does not expect the new law to materially impact its business outlook and reaffirmed its 2023 earnings forecast range of $1.50 to $1.65 per share, with a midpoint of $1.58 per share and projected annual earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% through at least 2026.PPL Corporation (NYSE: PPL), based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is a leading U.S. energy company focused on providing electricity and natural gas safely, reliably and affordably to more than 3.5 million customers in the U.S. PPL's high-performing, award-winning utilities are addressing energy challenges head-on by building smarter, more resilient and more dynamic power grids and advancing sustainable energy solutions.

217,b89cf76e-625b-3052-a154-7f8d449c2698,ULTA,2023-03-25,Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ulta-beauty-inc-ulta-trending-130001213.html,1679662801,STORY,['ULTA'],"[Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this beauty products retailer have returned -3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, which Ulta falls in, has lost 3.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Ulta is expected to post earnings of $6.75 per share, indicating a change of +7.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $25.21 points to a change of +5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +3.8%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.22 indicates a change of +8% from what Ulta is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.7%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Ulta.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ULTA _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Ulta, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.34 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.07 billion and $11.66 billion estimates indicate +8.5% and +5.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUlta reported revenues of $3.23 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.2%. EPS of $6.68 for the same period compares with $5.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.22%. The EPS surprise was +17.4%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Ulta is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ulta. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have lost about 34.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Halozyme Therapeutics due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Halozyme’s Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues MissHalozyme Therapeutics, reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of 48 cents per share, narrowly beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents. Adjusted earnings were also higher than our model estimates of 44 cents per share. The company’s earnings were 42 cents per share in the year-ago period.Total revenues increased 78% year over year to $181.4 million, primarily driven by strong royalty payments from J&amp;J for subcutaneous Darzalex (daratumumab). The addition of product sales following the acquisition of Antares Pharma and higher collaboration revenues boosted the top line. Revenues, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $186 million. Total revenues also missed our model estimates of $182.9 million in the reported quarter.Quarterly HighlightsHalozyme’s top line comprises product sales, royalties and revenues under collaborative agreements.Royalty revenues were $106 million in the fourth quarter, up 69% from the year-ago quarter. This was mainly driven by robust demand for J&amp;J’s subcutaneous Darzalex and to a lesser extent, Roche’s Phesgo. Royalty revenues generated nearly 58.6% of the total revenues for the company during the reported quarter.Product sales were $61.1 million in the quarter, significantly up from the year-ago quarter. The company supplies API to ENHANZE partners like J&amp;J and Roche, which contributes to its product revenues.Story continuesRevenues under collaborative agreements were $14.4 million, indicating a 16.5% increase year over year.Research and development expenses increased 123.2% year over year to $22.6 million. This was mainly due to planned investments in the ENHANZE technology, as well as one-time compensation costs incurred by HALO related to the Antares Pharma acquisition.Selling, general and administrative expenses were $37.7 million, significantly up from the year-ago period. The rise was mainly on account of one-time compensation costs incurred by HALO for the Antares Pharma acquisition as well as higher compensation expenses related to the ongoing combined larger workforce.Full-Year 2022 ResultsThe company’s adjusted diluted earnings for 2022 were $2.21 per share, compared with $2.00 in the year-ago period.2023 GuidanceThe company maintained its previously issued financial guidance for 2023, in January.The company expects total revenues in 2023 to be between $815 million and $845 million, indicating year-over-year increase of 23-28%. This growth can be attributed to continued strength of Darzalex SC and Phesgoalong, with revenues from royalty.The company expects revenues from royalties to increase approximately 23-26% year over year to $445-$455 million. Collaborative revenues are expected to be flat year over year.The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $2.50-$2.65 per share (excluding stock-based compensation expense), implying year-over-year growth of more than 10%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -25.57% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Halozyme Therapeutics has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Halozyme Therapeutics has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerHalozyme Therapeutics is part of the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry. Over the past month, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), a stock from the same industry, has gained 1.2%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended December 2022 more than a month ago.Vertex reported revenues of $2.3 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.1%. EPS of $3.76 for the same period compares with $3.37 a year ago.Vertex is expected to post earnings of $3.09 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.9%.The overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Vertex.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.Textron (TXT) is a stock many investors are watching right now. TXT is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 13.34, which compares to its industry's average of 22.42. Over the last 12 months, TXT's Forward P/E has been as high as 18.19 and as low as 13.10, with a median of 15.35.TXT is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1.19. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. TXT's industry has an average PEG of 1.58 right now. Over the last 12 months, TXT's PEG has been as high as 1.55 and as low as 0.98, with a median of 1.17.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. TXT has a P/S ratio of 1.07. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.53.Story continuesFinally, investors should note that TXT has a P/CF ratio of 11.29. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. TXT's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 45.01. Over the past 52 weeks, TXT's P/CF has been as high as 14.91 and as low as 10.05, with a median of 11.95.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Textron is likely undervalued currently.

The award has been offered by the 338th Enterprise Sourcing Squadron, JBSA-Randolph, San Antonio, TX.Details of the DealValued at $25 million, the contract is projected to be completed by Mar 21, 2026. This contract will offer F-16 operational capability for countries that have purchased F-16 jets recently.For nations that had previously purchased and operated F-16 jets, this contract offers aircraft maintenance and pilot training to support ongoing sustainment training or in-country training to aid aircraft upgrade programs.This award involves Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to Bahrain.Importance of the F-16 JetsOver the past decade, a rapid rise in global terrorism and adverse geopolitical situations across borders have boosted the demand for defense products. Combat aircraft constitute a major portion of this portfolio. It is imperative to mention here that the F-16 Falcon jets have significantly risen in importance on a global scale over the past few years.Over the past couple of years, the F-16 witnessed significant development, with nations like Taiwan, Bulgaria, Morocco and Bahrain signing agreements to procure new F-16 aircraft. To reap the benefits of the rising demand for F-16, Lockheed Martin introduced F-16 Block 70/72 in 2020, the most advanced F-16 aircraft, combining numerous capabilities and structural upgrades. This model provides a new aircraft structure that lasts 50% longer than the previously produced F-16 aircraft. Such advancements might have been ushering in contracts from Pentagon and other U.S. allies, like the latest one, thereby boosting Lockheed Martin’s revenue prospects.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, other nations like Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest weapons exporter worldwide, the nation has been spending significantly on defense products including combat aircraft.Story continuesLockheed, being a prominent combat aircraft manufacturer in the United States, enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fighter aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 3.95% during the 2023-2028 period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities, and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Lockheed, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Boeing BA, Northrop Grumman NOC and Textron TXT.Boeing’s Defense, Space &amp; Security segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft. This segment's primary products include military aircraft like F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15, P-8, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk aircraft.BA stock has a long-term earnings growth of 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales implies a 22.1% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned combat aircraft. The company also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems. This is to help warfighters in accomplishing missions anytime, anywhere and under any conditions.NOC stock boasts a long-term earnings growth of 3.5%.

Now New Residents Are Facing LayoffsRussia Seeks 400,000 More Recruits as Latest Ukraine Push StallsJack Dorsey’s Wealth Tumbles $526 Million After Hindenburg ShortDespite the political uproar, many industry watchers say it’s increasingly likely the railroad operator will face few financial penalties. Even the threat of more federal regulation wouldn’t affect Norfolk Southern any differently than its peers.That message has been slow to resonate on Wall Street, where Norfolk Southern shares have lost a fifth of their value since the accident, a significant drop in the typically staid industry.“The share reaction to the derailment has been a complete overreaction,” said Jason Seidl, an analyst with TD Cowen, in an interview. “In the long run, Norfolk and the other rails are expected to see strong growth. So, if you are a long-term investor, this is a buying opportunity.”Norfolk Southern has been the target of withering criticism after a 149-car train derailed on Feb. 3 in East Palestine, Ohio, dumping ethylhexyl acrylate, isobutylene and other chemicals into soil and local waterways. The damage was exacerbated after authorities decided to vent and burn five railcars containing vinyl chloride on Feb. 6 out of concern that the contents were heating up and could explode. Still, the derailment caused no fatalities nor direct injuries, which would have escalated the severity.The Atlanta-based railroad has insurance that will cushion the blow of remediation expenses, which include $24 million spent so far to support local residents whose jobs were disrupted. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates Norfolk Southern will spend somewhere between $150 million and $250 million fixing the mess, a majority of which may be the actual cleanup. Environmental fines for similar accidents have been in the multimillion-dollar range. Ohio has sued the company seeking unspecified damages but that isn’t expected to add significantly to costs.Story continuesIf insurance coverage applies, Bloomberg Intelligence estimates the total hit to Norfolk Southern’s earnings per share would be just 25 cents this year, or less than 2%. Norfolk Southern’s operating profit was $4.8 billion in 2022.“Over the next six to nine months, people are going to evaluate Norfolk’s stock on the fundamentals and I don’t think this unfortunate event is part of the fundamental story of the company,” said Amit Mehrotra, an analyst with Deutsche Bank.The disconnect between the market’s reaction and analysts’ appraisal of the derailment can be partly explained by videos of smoke billowing from the wreckage that went viral after the accident, sparking national news coverage and outrage on social media. US political polarization, which has grown more extreme since the 2016 election, further fueled the flames as lawmakers competed to condemn the incident and highlight the plight of forgotten folks in rural Ohio.To get ahead of lawmakers, Norfolk Southern committed to a six-point safety plan that includes adding hundreds of heat sensors alongside rail tracks. CEO Alan Shaw told a Senate committee on March 22 that the company supports more regulation, including higher standards on tank cars, a review of safety measures every three years, and providing first responders with more information on the contents of trains passing through their communities. The company has also made unprecedented pledges to reimburse lost property value related to the derailment and to set up a long-term medical fund.Those pledges and Shaw’s public apologies have defused calls for him or any other executives to step down in the wake of the accident.“I’m terribly sorry for the derailment in East Palestine and we’re working every day to make Norfolk Southern and the rail industry safer,” Shaw told lawmakers. “Norfolk Southern is here for the long haul and we won’t be finished until we make this right.”The long-term initiatives will drive up Norfolk Southern’s costs and weigh on earnings, according to John Eade, an analyst at Argus Research. Cargo volumes will be curtailed as the railroad rips up track on its mainline that passes through East Palestine to remove contaminated soil underneath. That work, which will be done on one of the two sets of tracks at a time to keep trains moving, will take about eight weeks to complete, Norfolk Southern has said.“They will struggle with earnings growth for pretty much the rest of the year,” Eade said in an interview. Earlier this month he cut his rating on Norfolk Southern shares to hold from buy, the only downgrade so far since the accident.Federal regulators have also opened broader investigations into the company’s culture and safety practices following a series of recent incidents involving the railroad.Trains derail about 1,000 times a year in the US, which is half the rate from two decades ago. In particularly bad crashes, including fatal ones, any impact on the stock price has usually disappeared within a year. That was the case in 2005 when two Norfolk Southern trains collided and released chlorine gas in Graniteville, South Carolina, killing nine people. Shares of CSX Corp. were only temporarily impacted in 2014 when a train spilled oil in downtown Lynchburg, Virginia, causing a fire and partial evacuation. And Union Pacific Corp.’s shares were outperforming the broader market a year after a collision near San Antonio released chlorine gas and killed three people, including the train’s conductor.These incidents, like the one in East Palestine, spurred calls for more oversight. Historically the costs to implement new safety measures have been shared among all railroads, not just the company with the most recent accident. In some cases, it’s been the tank-car makers and shippers that have borne the brunt of the expenses, rather than the railroads.History also shows that demand for rail isn’t affected by accidents. There’s no better way to haul chemicals or other bulky goods since trains are much safer than trucks and emit a fraction of the greenhouse gases. Norfolk Southern operates in the eastern U.S. and has only one major competitor, CSX.Austin Graff, founder and chief investment officer at Opal Capital, says railroads are generally considered to be high-quality businesses, and occasional fines and minor regulatory changes are to be expected. Neither will put Norfolk Southern out of business, he said.“Many value investors prefer to buy into bad news situations, understanding that the current perception is likely transitory,” Graff said. “When the narrative improves the company will likely trade much higher.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhat Happens When Sexting Chatbots Dump Their Human LoversHow to Keep Corporate Accounts Safe Amid Bank Collapse JittersIranian Activists Want Tech Companies to Ban the AyatollahChatGPT Advances Are Moving So Fast Regulators Can’t Keep UpA Visual Guide to How America Uses Freight Trains©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

(NYSE: BRK-A) has returned tens of thousands of percent over the years and consistently outperforms the market. Buffett purchased the company for just $8.3 million in 1965, and it’s now valued at nearly $700 billion, roughly a 10 million percent return.But one of Buffett’s top all-time picks and longest-held positions is one you might not expect. Berkshire Hathaway first started buying Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) stock in 1988 and continued accumulating shares since. Berkshire Hathaway now owns 400 million shares of Coca-Cola stock valued at a whopping $22 billion or about 8% of the company.In the 1988 time period that Buffett began purchasing the company, the stock was sitting at a few dollars per share, so Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on massive gains in the company. Coke also issues a dividend worth 44 cents per quarter, so he gains nearly $1 billion per year in dividends on top of that.While you’re unlikely to see those kinds of returns in Coca-Cola stock anymore because of its size, there are still value picks in the industry. For example, TruBrain is a startup that creates drinks and supplements focused on cognitive health and is currently valued at a fraction of what Coke was when Buffett invested in the company in 1988.Buffett likes Coca-Cola stock for one reason — the same reason he likes every company that he invests in: value. This has two meanings. First, he is notorious for only investing if it’s the right price and not a penny more. Coca-Cola stock, at the time, was at a good price with an interesting competitive edge. Coca-Cola owns nearly 50% of the U.S. soft drink market, so as long as people are drinking soft drinks, Coke will be performing well.Second, and perhaps more important, is that Coca-Cola creates value. Buffett likes “productive assets” in that they produce cash and make a product. The legendary investor has stayed away from things like cryptocurrency because it doesn’t produce anything.Story continuesBuffett has previously mentioned Coca-Cola in this sense. He noted how Coca-Cola produces nearly 2 billion drink servings per day. So if Coke needs to produce more profit, it could raise its drink prices by just 1 cent per serving and produce an extra $20 million per day.Picks like this are Buffetts' bread and butter, and he still likes Coca-Cola stock as much as the day he bought it. Coca-Cola has maintained its market dominance for decades, and as long as it keeps that up, Buffett is unlikely to sell.See more on startup investing from Benzinga.This Startup Built the World's First AI Marketing Platform That Can Understand Emotion and Some of the Biggest Companies on the Planet Are Already Using ItBuy Online, Print Instantly at Home: Retail Investors are Funding The 3D Printing Startup Pioneering a New Way To Buy and Recieve Your ProductsThe Tesla Of Lawn Mowers: Soon Your Cars Won't Be Your Only Self-Driving, All-Electric VehicleDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

(NYSE:WM)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-waste-management-110022699.html,1679742022,STORY,['WM'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Waste Management fair value estimate is US$133With US$154 share price, Waste Management appears to be trading close to its estimated fair valueOur fair value estimate is 20% lower than Waste Management's analyst price target of US$167Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.58bUS$2.42bUS$2.93bUS$3.23bUS$3.43bUS$3.59bUS$3.72bUS$3.84bUS$3.95bUS$4.06bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x12Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.49%Est @ 3.76%Est @ 3.25%Est @ 2.90%Est @ 2.65% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$1.5kUS$2.1kUS$2.3kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.1b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.1%) = US$71bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$71b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$33bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$54b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$154, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Waste Management as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.981. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Waste ManagementStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Commercial Services industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Commercial Services market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Therefore, if you purchase Stryker's shares on or after the 30th of March, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 28th of April.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.75 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.00 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Stryker stock has a trailing yield of around 1.1% on the current share price of $276.69. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for Stryker Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. That's why it's good to see Stryker paying out a modest 45% of its earnings. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Over the last year it paid out 52% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's positive to see that Stryker's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Fortunately for readers, Stryker's earnings per share have been growing at 18% a year for the past five years. Stryker is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. This is a reasonable combination that could hint at some further dividend increases in the future.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Stryker has delivered 13% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.The Bottom LineIs Stryker worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, Stryker paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 3 warning signs with Stryker and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Haemonetics has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Stryker has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that HAE's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.HAE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 25.88, while SYK has a forward P/E of 27.38. We also note that HAE has a PEG ratio of 2.59. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. SYK currently has a PEG ratio of 2.81.Another notable valuation metric for HAE is its P/B ratio of 4.96. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Whirlpool's current trading price of US$126 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Whirlpool’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Whirlpool What's The Opportunity In Whirlpool?According to my valuation model, Whirlpool seems to be fairly priced at around 4.13% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Whirlpool today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $121.09, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Whirlpool’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Whirlpool?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with an expected decline of -3.5% in revenues over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for Whirlpool. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Currently, WHR appears to be trading around its fair value, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock optimal for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on WHR for a while, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The stock appears to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help gel your views on WHR should the price fluctuate below its true value.If you want to dive deeper into Whirlpool, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

This is the first share repurchase authorization made by the company since its inception.According to Talos’ president and CEO, Timothy S.

Talos also mentioned in its press release that it was under no obligation to repurchase any specific sum of money or a certain number of shares under the program, which might be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time.The company intends to keep investing in catalysts, while keeping an eye on credit quality and chances to distribute extra cash flow to shareholders.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Talos carries a Zack Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the energy sector are CVR Energy CVI, Par Pacific Holdings Inc.

For those of you interested, check out 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Dividend stocks have faced headwinds in the past given the rise in interest rates which have led to higher Treasury yields. With higher Treasury yields, capital has moved from the broader equity market into the U.S. Treasury market and the valuations of many leading dividend stocks are arguably lower than what they would have been as a result.In terms of interest rates, the Federal Reserve on March 22 raised interest rates by 25 basis points to bring the benchmark funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%.After the interest rate raise, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said, ""We believe, however, that events in the banking system over the past two weeks are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which would in turn affect economic outcomes. It is too soon to determine the extent of these effects, and therefore too soon to tell it how monetary policy should respond. As a result, we no longer state that we anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate to quell inflation. Instead, we now anticipate that some additional policy firming may be appropriate.""Story continuesWith the Federal Reserve Chairman's comments, the broader markets declined on March 22 as the market didn't like Powell's commentary on credit conditions. Recently, Deutsche Bank stock has declined on March 24 as its credit default swaps have increased. Given Deutsche Bank is a huge bank, any substantial financial difficulties Deutsche Bank faces could affect the global economy if regulators don't do enough to contain the situation.Given the economic outcomes could be negative, an economic slowdown could also negatively affect leading dividend stocks. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.chrisdorney/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 13 Best Long Term Dividend Stocks to Buy Now, we chose 13 stocks that have competitive advantages and growth potential in the long term that also pay a dividend.We ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q4.For those of you interested, check out 14 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.13 Best Long Term Dividend Stocks to Buy Now13.

To skip our detailed analysis of the travel industry, you can go directly to see the 10 most visited countries in the world.When the entire world ground to a halt in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, many industries were devastated but none more so than the hospitality industry. After lockdowns were imposed across most countries, travel came to a complete halt, which initially encompassed both international and domestic travel. From the first quarter of 2020 to the second quarter of 2022, travel restrictions were imposed by most nations and even where travel was allowed, there were a lot of regulations which had to be fulfilled before one could travel, which included some of the most visited countries in the world.In between these two years, there were little pockets which allowed for some level of movement, such as the summer of 2021 when conditions seemed to be getting better, only for the Omicron variant to rear its head and see restrictions imposed once more. However, even in these times, many people preferred not to travel because of various caveats such as registration apps, Covid-19 negative tests, proof of vaccination and many more. Some places even required multiple tests depending on the location and country of origination, while restrictions for different countries were lowered or removed at different points in time considering the threat of the virus spreading from the country of origination.35 most visited countries in the worldPhoto by Cris Tagupa on UnsplashThe tourism industry is one of the biggest industries in the world and accounts for nearly a tenth of the global GDP while providing employment to more than 320 million people across the world. For many countries, tourism actually accounts for a significant proportion of their GDP which suffered massively as a result of the aforementioned lockdowns, including some of the most visited countries in the world. In 2019 alone, more than 1.5 billion people travelled internationally while billions more traveled domestically, though the number saw a massive decline of 72% once the pandemic hit.Story continuesSurprisingly, the restrictions imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic mostly came to an end / were reduced significantly after vaccines were developed by some of the biggest pharmaceutical in the world, on a timescale much faster than anticipated with much more success as well. Because of successful global inoculation which has seen over 5.5 billion receive a Covid-19 vaccine, approximating to over 72% of the world's population, countries were able to open up in early 2022 and pent-up demand for travel saw some of the largest airlines in the world including Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NASDAQ:DAL), American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) to experience large increases in demand. Most of these companies laid of tens of thousands of employees during the pandemic and posted major losses in both 2020 and 2021 while many have also posted a loss in 2022, even as record revenue was earned. This was mainly a result of higher prices rather than volumes as the number of passengers still haven't recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Most airlines started to charge much higher prices for both economy and business class seats, though the latter saw a much greater increase in percentage terms. While many airlines are still some way away from breakeven, United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) did become profitable again in Q2 2022 because of higher demand. When discussing the outlook for 2023, United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) stated in their earnings call for Q4 2022 ""As we think about the revenue outlook for 2023, we are bullish about global long-haul. We expect industry capacity across both the Atlantic and Pacific. The United is the largest carrier to be flattish versus 2019, which provides for an easy setup and positive RASM year-over-year.""International demand remains incredibly strong, and we are looking at the potential for record profits and margins across our global network. Asia has traditionally been a margin drag on our global flying, but we’ve worked diligently to rebuild the network and close this gap. And we think 2023 will validate that we accomplish that goal. Asia is also close to being fully opened, allowing United to reestablish the bulk of the specific flying outside of China. It’s worth noting that restrictions on the use of Russian airspace will constrain United from flying both of our China network in 2023. This same restriction will also limit our ability to fly to India.Of course, airlines aren't the only companies which are reaping the benefits of pent-up demand; hotels are cashing in as well, as tourists have been happy to pay higher prices which has led to higher revenues and profits for some of the largest hotel chains in the world.According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization, some regions in 2023 will see travel return to pre-pandemic levels which is huge news for one of the worst-hit industries by the pandemic. Europe is one of the regions leading the charge for tourism revival and this is expected to continue in 2023 according to the European Travel Commission, building on the foundation established in 2022, which is important considering that several European countries feature on our list of the most visited countries in the world. While long-haul travel is still behind short-haul and medium-haul, the prospects for 2023 still seem encouraging, though Eastern Europe will understandably see much slower growth because of the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war. Other challenges that the travel industry has to face include higher inflation which has hurt disposable income of customers while corporations are also cutting down on travel and face-to-face meetings in a bid to control expenses and deliver higher operating profit growth to shareholders. In Europe, the domestic sector is expected to post a full recovery by 2024 and international travel will recover by 2025. According to the President of the European Travel Commission, ""Looking forward to 2023, we expect the tourism sector in Europe to continue its strong rebound. As European short-haul travel is well on its way to recovery, the tourism industry’s attention has now turned to long-haul arrivals. In welcome news, we can expect the long-awaited return of Asia Pacific visitors in the coming months. As the industry navigates the many challenges it faces this year, it is vital that the sector continues to be receptive to consumer demand, improving the visitor experience at destination and targeting markets and segments less affected by economic slowdown.”To determine our list of the most visited countries in the world, we accessed the dashboard set up by the United Nation World Tourism Organization. Since 2022 statistics haven't been finalized yet, we relied on 2021 data. We checked both the number of visitors for each country and expenditure by tourists in the country in USD, assigning 80% weightage to the former criterion and 20% to the latter. So, let's now take a look at the countries expecting the most tourists in 2023, starting with:35. AndorraNumber of visitors in 2021 (in millions): 1.9One of the biggest attractions of Andorra is the Caldea Spa Center which is a huge natural thermal spring complex which has both indoor and outdoor swimming pools. Andorra may be a small country but is home to several peaks and forests.34. LatviaNumber of visitors in 2021 (in millions): 1.9The Baltic Sea coast and beautiful nature attract a lot of visitors to Latvia.33. JordanNumber of visitors in 2021 (in millions): 2.0Jordan is home to one of the modern wonders of the world in Petra, a historic archeological site.

KyrgyzstanNumber of visitors in 2021 (in millions): 3.2Kyrgyzstan attracts a lot of hikers thanks to its thousands of mountain trails which cross gorgeous passes and amazing peaks.26. BelgiumNumber of visitors in 2021 (in millions): 3.2For anyone visiting Belgium, a trip to Bruges is a must, with the Historic Center of Bruges being designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2000. Meanwhile, cities such as Brussels or Antwerp are also well worth visiting.25. CanadaNumber of visitors in 2021 (in millions): 3.1Canada is home to the most number of lakes of any country in the world, not to mention mountains and glaciers.24. BelarusNumber of visitors in 2021 (in millions): 3.4Belarus is likely to drop off the the list of the most visited countries in the world after sanctions were implemented against the country for its involvement in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.23. UkraineNumber of visitors in 2021 (in millions): 3.7Ukraine will definitely drop off this list when its updated for 2022 after Russia invaded the country in February 2022. Russia has destroyed many historical sites in Ukraine and it will probably take years if not decades for the country to return to normal.22. MoroccoNumber of visitors in 2021 (in millions): 3.7Hiking to remote waterfalls, desert treks, lively markets and beaches all contribute to Morocco being one of the most visited countries in the world.21.

AlbaniaNumber of visitors in 2021 (in millions): 5.0Sandy beaches attract a vast majority of the over 5 million annual tourists in Albania.19. Dominican RepublicNumber of visitors in 2021 (in millions): 4.4One of the most visited Latin American countries, Dominican Republic relies on tourism for more than 10% of its GDP. Arrivals to the country are mainly from the U.S., Canada, France, Russia and Argentina.18. SwitzerlandNumber of visitors in 2021 (in millions): 4.3One of the most expensive countries in Europe, Switzerland is home to numerous places to visit including Interlaken, Lucerne, Lausanne and of course its biggest cities in Zurich and Geneva.

Of course, the country is also home to stunning natural beauty.16. NetherlandsNumber of visitors in 2021 (in millions): 5.3It takes several days to visit just Amsterdam properly, which also attracts many tourists for its famously lax marijuana laws and its Red District. However, Amsterdam is just one of the cities / towns that are a must-visit in Netherlands, with others including Zaanse-Schans, Hague and Giethoorn.15. HungaryNumber of visitors in 2021 (in millions): 7.2Hungary is a relatively cheap place to visit especially for a European nation. Further, there's a lot of natural beauty in the country too especially in its countryside.14. United KingdomNumber of visitors in 2021 (in millions): 6.2London is generally the most-visited city in the UK but other areas attract a huge number of tourists as well including Brighton in England, Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland, and Cork in Ireland.13. PolandNumber of visitors in 2021 (in millions): 9.7Poland's capital Warsaw was destroyed more than 80% by Germans during World War II before being subjected to Russian rule for decades afterwards. Despite these massive setbacks, the country has recovered to become one of the fastest growing economies in Europe while continuing to attract tourists to various towns and cities including Gdansk and Krakow.12. PortugalNumber of visitors in 2021 (in millions): 9.6Delicious food, must-visit vineyards, sunny weather and amazing landscapes have earned Portugal a place on our list of the most visited countries in the world.11.

Data from the BOREAS study showed that participants who were administered Dupixent achieved a 30% reduction in moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations — the primary endpoint — over a 52-week treatment period against placebo. Treatment with the drug also led to improved lung function, quality of life and reduction in disease symptoms.Shares of Regeneron were up 6.8% on Mar 23 in response to the positive data announcement. Sanofi’s stock also rose 6.0% post the announcement.Currently, people suffering from COPD indication have limited treatment options. No novel treatments have been approved targeting this indication in over a decade, even though the disease is the third leading cause of death worldwide. Management estimates that around 300,000 people are living with uncontrolled COPD with type II inflammation in the United States.Following the latest data announcement, Regeneron/Sanofi’s Dupixent is now the first and only biologic to demonstrate clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in exacerbations over placebo in COPD patients. Many large-cap pharma giants like AstraZeneca AZN and GSK GSK have failed to achieve statistical significance in their clinical studies targeting COPD indications. Smoking is also a key risk factor for COPD.A CNBC article also pointed out that based on this encouraging data, analysts at JP Morgan expect Regeneron to generate an additional $1.5 billion to $2 billion from Dupixent product sales, provided the drug is eventually approved for the COPD indication.Shares of Regeneron have risen 11.2% in the year so far against the industry’s 6.4% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesDupixent is being jointly marketed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. Sanofi records global net product sales of Dupixent, while Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with the drug’s global sales. The drug is currently approved in the United States and Europe for five type II inflammatory diseases, namely severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, severe asthma, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has become the key driver of the top line for both Regeneron and Sanofi. Dupixent generated global product sales of $8.7 billion in 2022, which were recorded by Sanofi, representing 40% year-over-year growth. With outside U.S. revenues accelerating and multiple approvals for new indications and expansion in younger patient populations expected, its sales are likely to be higher.Dupixent is now annualizing at close to €9.0 billion in sales after around five years on the market. Sanofi expects Dupixent to achieve more than €13 billion in peak sales and €10 billion in 2023.Sanofi and Regeneron are also studying dupilumab in late-stage studies in a broad range of diseases driven by type II inflammation, like bullous pemphigoid and chronic spontaneous urticaria.In 2018, AstraZeneca announced that two phase III studies – GALATHEA and TERRANOVA – evaluating its IL-5 inhibitor Fasenra (benralizumab) failed to meet the primary endpoint of a statistically-significant reduction of exacerbations in COPD patients. AstraZeneca’s Fasenra is currently approved by the FDA in severe eosinophilic asthma indications since 2017. Currently, AstraZeneca is evaluating another pipeline candidate, mitiperstat, in a mid-stage study in COPD indication, which was initiated in first-quarter 2023.Like AstraZeneca, a similar setback was also faced by GSK in COPD studies. In 2018, the FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) to GSK’s regulatory filing seeking label expansion for its successful IL-5 inhibitor Nucala (mepolizumab) in COPD. The FDA issued the CRL as it required more clinical data on the drug before granting approval in the COPD indication. The drug is still being evaluated in a late-stage study in COPD by GSK.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Roche RHHBY entered into a deal with Eli Lilly LLY for the development of its blood test for early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesSanofi’s Dupixent Meets Primary Endpoint in COPD study: The pivotal phase III study, BOREAS, which evaluated Sanofi/Regeneron’s Dupixent for treating COPD, met both its primary and secondary endpoints. Data from the BOREAS study demonstrated that Dupixent led to a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction (30%) in exacerbations compared to placebo. In fact, treatment with the drug also led to significant improvement in lung function, quality of life and respiratory symptoms.Dupixent is currently approved in the United States and EU for five type II inflammatory diseases, namely severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, severe asthma, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis. The promising data from the COPD study opens up a new avenue for growth for this already highly successful medicine.Sanofi and Regeneron are also evaluating Dupixent in the COPD indication in an ongoing second replicate phase III study (NOTUS). Data from the same is expected next year, following which the companies plan to file for approval.The European Commission approved Dupixent for treating children six months to five years of age with severe atopic dermatitis, also called eczema, who are candidates for systemic therapy. Dupixent was approved by the FDA for atopic dermatitis in children in this age group in June 2022. In Europe, approximately 80,000 infants and young children have uncontrolled severe atopic dermatitis, which signifies the drug’s significant unmet need for kids under 5 years.Story continuesFDA Gives CRL to AbbVie NDA for Parkinson’s Candidate: The FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) to AbbVie’s new drug application (“NDA”) seeking approval for ABBV-951 for the treatment of motor fluctuations in patients with advanced PD. ABBV-951 is a solution of carbidopa and levodopa prodrugs, which are the standard of care for PD patients. ABBV-951 has been designed to offer continuous subcutaneous delivery of CD/LD prodrugs through a pump device and offer a better patient experience. In the CRL, the FDA has asked for some extra information about the pump device used to administer the medicine. The FDA has not requested any additional efficacy/safety studies.AbbVie’s phase II study evaluating Rinvoq (upadacitinib) for patients with moderately to severely active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) met the primary endpoint in the 30 mg group. The primary endpoint of the study was achieving SLE Responder Index (SRI-4) with a steroid dose less than or equal to 10 mg prednisone equivalent once daily at week 24. Based on the phase II positive data, AbbVie is advancing upadacitinib to phase III development for SLE.AbbVie also announced positive data from a phase III induction study evaluating Skyrizi (risankizumab) to treat moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. The data showed that a significantly higher proportion of patients, 20.3% treated with risankizumab achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission compared to 6.2% of patients on placebo at week 12. The study also met all secondary endpoints, including clinical, endoscopic and histologic outcomes. Skyrizi is presently approved for Crohn's disease, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis.Roche &amp; Lilly’s Alzheimer’s Collaboration: Roche announced a collaboration with Lilly for the development of Elecsys Amyloid Plasma Panel (EAPP), its blood test for earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. The FDA had granted Breakthrough Device Designation to EAPP in July last year. Lilly has donanemab and remternetug in its Alzheimer’s pipeline. In January, the FDA issued a CRL to Lilly’s biologics license application for donanemab for treating early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 1.8% in the last five trading sessions.Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnHere’s how the eight major stocks performed in the last five trading sessions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the last five trading sessions, AstraZeneca rose the most (1.9%), while Merck declined the most (2.9%).In the past six months, AstraZeneca has risen the most (26.9%), while Roche has declined the most (9.5%).(See the last pharma stock roundup here: M&amp;A Boom in Drug Industry With PFE &amp; SNY Deals, Other Updates)What's Next in the Pharma World?Watch out for regular pipeline and regulatory updates next week.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:CSCO). The company's stock had a relatively subdued couple of weeks in terms of changes in share price, which continued to float around the range of US$46.46 to US$50.99. However, is this the true valuation level of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Cisco Systems’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems What Is Cisco Systems Worth?Great news for investors – Cisco Systems is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $73.00, but it is currently trading at US$49.73 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Cisco Systems’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.What does the future of Cisco Systems look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Cisco Systems' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 27%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since CSCO is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CSCO for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CSCO. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.If you'd like to know more about Cisco Systems as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.
