The fund, a product of the financial company Charles Schwab Corp., tracks the total return of an index following the performance of intermediate-term US corporate bonds.Such a large flow is usually either the hallmark of a tax-friendly trade known as a heartbeat — in which case outflows can be expected in coming days — or of moves by a large model portfolio. Such a portfolio shift was suspected earlier this month, when roughly $4 billion was pulled from BlackRock Inc.’s iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (ESGU).“We periodically review and update the asset allocations and ETF selections across our packaged solutions,” a representative from Schwab’s asset management unit said in response to a query on the sudden inflow.Money has been cycling out of ETFs tied to shorter term bonds this month. ETFs tracking bonds of a one- to three-year duration saw $3 billion of outflows in March, while those tracking three- to 10-year bonds had inflows of $5.6 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Athanasios Psarofagis.“People are rotating out a bit more on the curve hoping for a Fed pivot,” he said.Sextupling assets overnight is impressive in any case, especially as the influx of cash comes at a time of instability for the Schwab empire. The Westlake, Texas-based firm saw unrealized losses grow to more than $29 billion last year as long-dated bonds weighed on its balance sheet. High interest rates have pressured customers to cycle their cash out of the firm’s accounts.Story continuesThrough Tuesday’s close, the Schwab ETF has returned roughly 3.2% this year, outperforming many similar ETFs tracking investment-grade bonds where the average return was about 2.3%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.More than 90% of the fund’s holdings relate to companies in the industrials and financials sectors, including names like Goldman Sachs Group Inc., PG&amp;E Corp., and Wells Fargo &amp; Co.Companies with bottom-tier (BBB) investment-grade ratings make up the majority of the portfolio. Nearly all of the bonds expire within five to ten years. Last week, companies with investment-grade credit ratings rushed to market as the spread between junk and high-grade bonds expanded to a five-month high.Todd Sohn, an ETF strategist at Strategas Securities, expects the SCHI investor found the risk profile of intermediate corporate bonds appealing, especially given the “very messy tape” in the equities market.“The ETF route is always easier, cleaner,” said Sohn. “It can be hard to dissect corporate bonds - some don’t trade, or you may end up selecting the wrong individual bonds. With the ETF, you are getting broad, transparent exposure. It’s just far cleaner and more accessible to the average investor.”--With assistance from Sam Potter.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Texas Preacher’s $24 Million Ponzi SchemeSVB’s Collapse Shows the World’s Favorite Safe Asset Isn’t Risk-FreeCollege Students Are About to Put a Robot on the Moon Before NASAA Credit Crunch Is the Last Thing the Strained US Economy NeedsThe Triumph of UBS Is Also the Humbling of Swiss Banking©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.STMicroelectronics has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Texas Instruments has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that STM likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than TXN has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.STM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.22, while TXN has a forward P/E of 23.57. We also note that STM has a PEG ratio of 2.44. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. TXN currently has a PEG ratio of 2.53.Another notable valuation metric for STM is its P/B ratio of 3.52. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TXN has a P/B of 11.03.These metrics, and several others, help STM earn a Value grade of B, while TXN has been given a Value grade of D.Story continuesSTM is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

Shares have lost about 7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Range Resources due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Range Resources Tops Earnings &amp; Revenue Estimates in Q4Range Resourcesreported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.26 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12. The bottom line significantly improved from the prior-year quarter’s earnings of 96 cents per share.Total quarterly revenues of $1,630 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,019 million. The top line also improved from the prior-year quarter’s $1,567 million.The strong quarterly results were driven by higher natural gas-equivalent production volumes.Operational PerformanceIn fourth-quarter 2022, the company’s production averaged 2,204.5 million cubic feet equivalent per day, up slightly from the prior-year period. Natural gas contributed 69% to total production, while NGLs and oil accounted for the rest.Oil production declined 23% from the year-ago period, while NGL output increased 6%. Natural gas production declined.Its total price realization (excluding derivative settlements and before third-party transportation costs) averaged $5.36 per thousand cubic feet equivalent (Mcfe), down 5% year over year. Natural gas prices rose 5% on a year-over-year basis to $5.52 per Mcf. NGL prices declined 25%, while oil prices increased 8%.Costs &amp; ExpensesTotal costs and expenses declined to $632.6 million from $657 million in the year-ago quarter. Total transportation, gathering, processing and compression costs, as well as exploration costs, declined in the reported quarter.Story continuesCapital Expenditure &amp; Balance SheetIn the fourth quarter, the company’s drilling and completion expenditure was $99.9 million. An amount of $9.5 million was used in acreage and gathering facilities.At the quarter end, it had total debt of $1,842 million.OutlookFor 2023, Range Resources expects total production of 2.12-2.16 billion cubic feet equivalent per day (Bcfe/d), with 30% attributed to liquid production.RRC anticipates capital spending of $570-$615 million for the year. Direct operating expenses are projected to be 11-13 cents per Mcfe, while exploration expenses are estimated at $22-$28 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -21.78% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Range Resources has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

8,19c00f80-55f6-3a42-bdf0-3041e876baab,NUE,2023-03-30,Nucor Corporation (NUE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucor-corporation-nue-attracting-investor-130001568.html,1680094801,STORY,['NUE'],"[Nucor (NUE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this steel company have returned -11.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.3% change. The Zacks Steel - Producers industry, to which Nucor belongs, has lost 3.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nucor is expected to post earnings of $4.13 per share, indicating a change of -46.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -7% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $14.35 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -50.2%. This estimate has changed +9.6% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.69 indicates a change of -11.6% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +8.1%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nucor.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NUE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nucor, the consensus sales estimate of $8.26 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -21.2%. The $33.1 billion and $29.04 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -20.3% and -12.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $8.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -15.8%. EPS of $4.89 for the same period compares with $7.97 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.29%. The EPS surprise was +16.99%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, the gross margin contracted 300 basis points (bps) to 55.1%. The adjusted gross profit increased 28.7% to $1,590.5 million, while the gross margin declined 70 bps to 57.4%. The decline in the gross margin can be attributed to a 50-bps deleverage from foreign currency, offset by a 30-bps decline in the product margin. The increase in product margin was driven by lower air freight expenses, partially offset by higher markdowns in the merchandise mix.SG&amp;A expenses of $803.1 million increased 25.1% from the year-ago quarter. SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of net revenues, were 29%, down 120 bps from the 30.2% reported in the prior-year quarter due to the leverage in the operating channels and a gain on foreign exchange. This was somewhat offset by higher corporate SG&amp;A, and a slight increase in depreciation and amortization.Income from operations declined 47% year over year to $314.4 million. The operating margin fell significantly to 11.3% from the prior-year quarter’s 27.7%.The adjusted income from operations rose 33% year over year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 to $785.3 million.

Management expects to open 45-50 net new company-operated stores in fiscal 2023, along with the completion of 25 co-located remodels. The total store openings in fiscal 2023 will imply a square footage increase in the low-double digits.The store openings in fiscal 2023 are likely to include 30-35 stores in international markets, with the majority of these planned to be opened in China.Financialslululemon exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,154.9 million and stockholders’ equity of $3,148.8 million. At the end of fiscal 2022, the company had $393.5 million remaining under its committed revolving credit facility.

As of Jan 29, 2023, the company had $744 million remaining under its recently authorized $1-billion share repurchase program.OutlookFor the first quarter of fiscal 2023, management anticipates net revenues of $1,890-$1.930 billion, indicating 17-20% year-over-year growth. The company expects the fiscal first-quarter gross margin to expand 290-320 bps year over year.The gross margin is expected to benefit from lower air freight expenses, offset by currency headwinds and strategic investments in the supply chain and distribution centers. Further, lululemon anticipates a 60-80 bps deleverage in the SG&amp;A expense rate for the fiscal first quarter, driven by higher investments.lululemon expects the operating margin to increase 200 bps in the fiscal first quarter. The company projects EPS of $1.93-$2 for the fiscal first quarter. The company estimates an effective tax rate of 30% for the fiscal first quarter.LULU also provided guidance for fiscal 2023. It anticipates net revenues of $9.300-$9.410 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 15-16%. This represents slightly better sales compared with its target under the Power of Three x2 growth plan.lululemon anticipates a gross margin increase of 140-160 bps for fiscal 2023. The increase is expected to mainly result from lower air freight expenses. For fiscal 2023, the company expects air freight to decline 150 bps year over year. However, the company expects fiscal 2023 markdowns to be in line with last year and fiscal 2019. The company’s gross margin guidance includes a 20-bps deleverage related to its multi-year distribution center project.For fiscal 2023, LULU expects the SG&amp;A rate to deleverage 120-140 bps year over year.

(NYSE:PVH) Trading At A 44% Discount?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pvh-corp-nyse-pvh-trading-140949518.html,1680098989,STORY,['PVH'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, PVH fair value estimate is US$158PVH is estimated to be 44% undervalued based on current share price of US$88.36 The US$89.94 analyst price target for PVH is 43% less than our estimate of fair valueHow far off is PVH Corp. (NYSE:PVH) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for PVH Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$259.0mUS$629.5mUS$529.5mUS$690.7mUS$778.0mUS$929.0mUS$1.04bUS$1.13bUS$1.21bUS$1.28bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 12.02%Est @ 9.04%Est @ 6.95%Est @ 5.48% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11% US$234US$514US$390US$460US$468US$504US$510US$502US$485US$462(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.5bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 11%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (11%– 2.1%) = US$15bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$15b÷ ( 1 + 11%)10= US$5.5bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$10.0b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$88.4, the company appears quite good value at a 44% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PVH as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.456. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for PVHStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Luxury market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

PVH surpassed resistance at the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.The 20-day simple moving average is a well-liked trading tool because it provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period. Additionally, short-term traders find this SMA very beneficial, as it smooths out short-term price trends and shows more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.Similar to other SMAs, if a stock's price moves above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive, while price falling below the moving average can signal a downward trend.Over the past four weeks, PVH has gained 10.1%. The company is currently ranked a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), another strong indication the stock could move even higher.Once investors consider PVH's positive earnings estimate revisions, the bullish case only solidifies.

Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.There are several stocks that currently pass through the screen and PVH (PVH) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a great candidate.Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 10.1% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. PVH meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 23.8% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for PVH is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 2.07. This indicates that the stock moves 107% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that PVH has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped PVH earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, PVH is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. PVH is currently trading at 0.62 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 62 cents for each dollar of sales.So, PVH appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to PVH, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, both Microchip Technology and Monolithic Power are holding a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.MCHP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.97, while MPWR has a forward P/E of 35.79. We also note that MCHP has a PEG ratio of 0.77. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. MPWR currently has a PEG ratio of 1.43.Another notable valuation metric for MCHP is its P/B ratio of 6.76. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, MPWR has a P/B of 13.36.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to MCHP's Value grade of B and MPWR's Value grade of D.Both MCHP and MPWR are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that MCHP is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While the stock has lost 5.4% over the past week, it could witness a trend reversal as a hammer chart pattern was formed in its last trading session. This could mean that the bulls have been able to counteract the bears to help the stock find support.While the formation of a hammer pattern is a technical indication of nearing a bottom with potential exhaustion of selling pressure, rising optimism among Wall Street analysts about the future earnings of this chipmaker is a solid fundamental factor that enhances the prospects of a trend reversal for the stock.1-month candlestick chart for MCHPWhat is a Hammer Chart and How to Trade It?This is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.'In simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price.When it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal.Hammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors.Like every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators.Story continuesHere's What Increases the Odds of a Turnaround for MCHPAn upward trend in earnings estimate revisions that MCHP has been witnessing lately can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side. That's because empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.The consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the last 30 days. This means that the Wall Street analysts covering MCHP are majorly in agreement about the company's potential to report better earnings than what they predicted earlier.If this is not enough, you should note that MCHP currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. And stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 usually outperform the market. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Moreover, a Zacks Rank of 2 for Microchip Tech is a more conclusive indication of a potential trend reversal, as the Zacks Rank has proven to be an excellent timing indicator that helps investors identify precisely when a company's prospects are beginning to improve.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Paolo here, subbing in for Amber.Employees and employers are unlikely to ever fully agree on whether return-to-office mandates are a smart business move. But as companies move full speed ahead on RTO plans, workers contend that there are some aspects of the office they find valuable.The top two reasons, according to a survey from market research company Gartner, are the ability to build relationships with colleagues and managers and collaborate with others, indicating that employees value social connection above anything else when they come to the office.Employees also say they'd trek into the office to break up their routines, be seen by leadership, and learn from others. Reasons that, while slight variations of collaboration, are still social in nature rather than strictly functional.And yet, despite the apparent common ground between employers and employees, 60% of executives in a Gartner pulse survey say the main reason their employees cite for not coming to the office is the lack of a “compelling need.” That’s not because social connection is a weak motivating factor; rather, it's been the victim of poor execution.One way to solve that problem is to clarify when people should be in the office, says Caitlin Duffy, a director in Gartner’s HR practice. Few things are more frustrating for an employee than making an earnest effort to show up to the office—expecting camaraderie and teamwork—only to find their colleagues stayed home.Learning events are another way to incentivize in-person attendance because employees will likely prefer live learning to a virtual marathon meeting, which is proven to be less effective.

The law takes effect June 26.Chevron, the largest oil refiner by volume in the state, called the measure ""a step backward"" and its approval ""likely to result in less reliable, less affordable fuel for state motorists,"" said spokesperson Ross Allen.Energy investment firm Tudor Pickering &amp; Holt said this week that independent refiner PBF Energy has the largest single exposure in the California market with 32% of its refining capacity in the state.PBF did not respond to a request for comment.""Refiners will also have to report more information to the watchdog,"" said Matthew Blair, Tudor Pickering's managing director of refiners, chemicals, and renewable fuels research.California is the largest U.S. market for motor fuels but has some of the highest retail prices because it is isolated from Gulf Coast and Midwest refining centers.This makes California reliant on a shrinking number of West Coast refineries and fuel imports from Asia and Europe.Those limits make the state vulnerable to plant outages and spikes in crude oil prices such as the summer and fall of 2022.The law will do nothing to increase gasoline supply to the West Coast, said John Auers, managing director of Refined Fuels Analytics. ""It won't do any good and it will do harm.""The uncertainty of possible penalties will weigh on the industry, said David Hackett, chairman of fuels consulting firm Stillwater Associates.""I think that's exactly what they are doing: Death by a thousand cuts.""

And US natural gas prices have tumbled 80% from an August high.Meanwhile, a separate index reading from the survey showed oil production remained positive but slowed, falling to 10.5 from 25.8, with the natural gas production index sinking to 7.4 from 29.4.""Growth in the oil and gas sector slowed to a crawl in the first quarter, as firms' faced increasing costs,"" Michael Plante, Dallas Fed senior research economist, said in a statement.

Developments associated with Suncor Energy SU, Shell SHEL and Petrobras PBR also made it to the headlines.Overall, it was a mixed seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 3.5% to close at $69.26 per barrel but natural gas prices fell 5.2% to end at $2.216 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).Coming back to the holiday-shortened week ended Dec 30, oil prices rebounded from their lowest levels since December 2021, as worries over the banking crisis eased. The commodity also got a leg up after U.S. Federal Reserve signaled an imminent end to interest rate increases.Meanwhile, natural gas finished down on forecasts for warmer weather and plentiful supply.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1. One of the world’s largest independent oil and gas producers, ConocoPhillips’ joint venture (JV) with energy services holding company Sempra Energy has been finalized for the Port Arthur liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) export project in Texas.Sempra Energy reached a final investment decision to develop and operate the first phase of Port Arthur LNG in Jefferson County, which will involve two liquefaction trains, LNG storage tanks and associated facilities. The project is expected to produce up to 13.5 million tons per annum of LNG.About 10.5 million tons per annum of the project’s LNG capacity is fully subscribed under long-term contracts with buyers, including ConocoPhillips and other offtakers. The project is estimated to cost $13 billion. (ConocoPhillips, Sempra Energy Finalize Port Arthur LNG JV)2. Rome-based energy biggie Eni signed an agreement with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners to develop three floating offshore wind projects in Latium and Sardinia, located 30 kilometers off the coast, with an overall capacity of 2 gigawatts (GW).The agreement comprises the development of a project in Latium, offshore Civitavecchia, with a total capacity of up to 540 megawatts (MW). The two other wind farms will be located offshore Sardinia, with a capacity of 500 MW and 1,000 MW.Combined, the three projects will produce about 5 terawatt-hours of energy per year (TWh/year). The companies expect commercial activities to start between 2028-2031 once the authorization process and subsequent construction phase is completed.

The amendment grants the activist investor an extended timeline until Mar 31 to add a new director to Suncor's board.In April 2022, Elliott Investment Management publicized its acquisition of a 3.4% stake in Suncor and has since been advocating for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to implement organizational modifications and undergo a strategy review.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The revised agreement between Suncor Energy and Elliott Investment Management could have a significant impact on the future of the former. With Elliott having greater influence over decision-making, the possibility of organizational changes and a strategy review becomes more likely. However, the appointment of Rich Kruger as Suncor’s CEO brings hope for addressing the challenges faced by the company. Overall, this revised agreement could result in a stronger and more competitive Suncor Energy in the long run.

The activist group wants the companies to commit to complete emissions cuts, including emissions from burning of the fuels they sell, also called Scope 3 emissions.As the world adapts to the difficulties of energy security and the energy transition, Shell has given two opposing scenarios of what the world could encounter. According to Shell's primary findings from the Energy Security Scenarios, there is no practical way to an immediate and sharp decline in emissions, and it would take extensive carbon removal and storage to bring the global temperature increase back down to 1.5°C.

However, its plan has been delayed by the Brazilian agency responsible for environmental protection. This decision has led to controversy among different stakeholders, including environmentalists, indigenous groups, and the government.Petrobras has been requested to provide additional information to Brazil's environmental regulator regarding its drilling plans at the Amazon river's mouth. This is necessary before the company can proceed to test its emergency oil spill response.Consequently, the drilling test, which was planned for the week, cannot take place until Petrobras provides all the necessary documentation.

33,646feb8f-7429-3904-b2b0-182d9df362a5,O,2023-03-30,Companies bid $264M in Gulf oil sale mandated by climate law,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-auction-gulf-mexico-oil-125551567.html,1680094551,STORY,"['XOM', 'CVX', 'BP.L', 'CL=F', 'NG=F']","[NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Oil companies offered a combined $264 million for drilling rights in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday in a sale mandated by last year’s climate bill compromise.The auction was the first in the Gulf in more than a year and drew strong interest from industry giants including Chevron, BP and ExxonMobil. But it could further test the loyalty of environmentalists and young voters who backed President Joe Biden in 2020 and were frustrated by this month's approval of a huge drilling project in Alaska.Developing the Gulf leases would produce up to 1.1 billion barrels of oil and more than 4 trillion cubic feet (113 billion cubic meters) of natural gas over 50 years, according to a government analysis. Burning that oil would increase planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions by tens of millions of tons, the analysis found.A legal challenge to the sale from environmental groups is pending in federal court.Bids were up 38% from the last auction and marked the most offered in a sale since 2017. Chevron USA was the top bidder, offering $108 million for 75 tracts. BP Exploration and Production had $47 million in high bids and Shell Offshore had $20 million in high bids.The next Gulf lease sale is scheduled in September. It's unknown how many more the administration could conduct as it faces continued pressure over approval of the ConocoPhillips Willow project in Alaska.The uncertainty means companies could be trying ""to lease blocks now in case future auctions are restricted,” said Sami Yahya, an analyst with S&amp;P Global.""From a global perspective, we are perpetually moving toward an environment with stronger anti-fossil fuel sentiment, as operators will continue to face more public scrutiny regarding emissions,“ Yahya said.The sale came two days before a deadline set in last year's climate bill. The bill also prohibits leasing public lands for renewable power unless tens of millions of acres are first offered for fossil fuels. That was a concession to West Virginia Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin, an industry supporter.Story continuesManchin issued a statement saying the sale results showed the climate bill was “holding this administration’s feet to the fire” to continue fossil fuel production.The climate law also raised the royalty rate companies must pay on oil they produce. The Biden administration set the rate for Wednesday at the maximum allowed — 18.75%, versus 12.5% historically.The parcels offered covered 114,000 square miles (295,000 square kilometers) an area larger than Arizona. Like past auctions of similar magnitude, only a fraction of the available acreage — about 2,600 square miles (6,700 square kilometers) — got bids.The vast majority of tracts had only one bidder as the company offers were opened Wednesday in New Orleans, in a state that is economically dependent on the oil and gas industry and especially vulnerable to climate change.Since it takes years to develop offshore parcels before crude is pumped, the leases could produce oil and gas long past 2030. That's when scientists say the world needs to have drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions to stave off catastrophic climate change.Sea level rise is a factor in Louisiana’s steady loss of coastal wetlands, which in addition to harboring a variety of fisheries and wildlife, provide a buffer between inland population areas and hurricanes that scientists say are growing stronger as the world warms.ExxonMobil offered almost $10 million on 69 tracts in the northwest Gulf. The company in 2021 bid nearly $15 million for tracts in the same area. It includes shallow waters — less than 656 feet (200 meters) deep — where oil has mostly played out.The acquisitions are likely linked to Exxon's pursuit of a government-industry collaboration to capture and store carbon dioxide from industrial plants in the Houston Ship Channel, experts said.""They purposely went out to lease property where the geology was right for storage and they knew any oil and gas production on a commercial scale was not a possibility,” said Eric Smith, associate director of the Tulane Energy Institute.The carbon dioxide would be transported in pipelines and injected deep under the Gulf floor, a process known as carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS. Oil and gas companies are banking on carbon capture to extend the lifespan of fossil fuel facilities,. Critics say the technology is unproven and less effective than switching to renewable energy.All the leases sold Wednesday were for oil and gas only, federal officials said.That means Exxon needs Interior Department cooperation to revise its lease agreements before the company can use them for carbon capture, said Justin Rostant, a principal analyst with industry consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.“There might be some risks associated with whether they're actually able to use it for carbon capture,” Rostant said. “That is a big question mark.""ExxonMobil spokesperson Todd Spitler declined to say if there was a link between its bids and the ship channel proposal.Environmentalists called on Biden to abide by campaign pledges to end new drilling on federal lands and water. Diane Hoskins with the group Oceana said the Democrat can “make good on his promise” by including an end to leasing in a long-overdue five-year plan for the Gulf.Oil industry groups called for more offshore lease sales so companies can continue exploration work to ensure future domestic supplies.It takes 90 days for the government to evaluate any bids, which means Wednesday's sale still could be blocked. The 2021 sale was subsequently blocked by a federal judge, then reinstated under the climate bill.“There’s been a lot of talk from the administration about taking climate change seriously and moving our economy away from fossil fuels, and yet we continue to see massive oil and gas projects, both onshore with Willow and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico,” said George Torgun, an Earthjustice attorney representing environmental groups in the pending federal lawsuit.Many of the leases sold Wednesday were in deep waters, which Torgun said increases the chance of another major oil spill like BP's Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010.Chevron said in a Monday court filing that it could lose millions of dollars if the leases were blocked.In coming months the administration plans to auction more than 500 square miles (1,400 square kilometers) of onshore oil and gas leases in Wyoming, New Mexico, Montana, Nevada and other states.___Brown reported from Billings, Montana.___Follow Matthew Brown and Kevin McGill on Twitter.]"

(NYSE:NRG) was covered in the 2019 letter with VST. We sold the shares as COVID induced volatility presented better risk/reward opportunities, but never subsequently repurchased shares—as we did with VST. Not only do we think VST is a better value, but the management team at NRG appears to have gone astray. Despite coming to his position during an activist campaign by Elliott Management in 2017, when the prior empire-building CEO was shown the door, the replacement CEO has seemingly embarked on the same failed strategy. In early December they announced the purchase of Vivint Smart Home, a smart home platform company, for $2.8 billion. The transaction diversifies NRG’s business, increases leverage, dramatically reduces intermediate-term shareholder capital returns, and most importantly, is the opposite of what management told us they were going to do when they assumed the role in 2017. The stock fell 15% on the day of the announcement and is down another 5% since then, and now 10% lower than when we first wrote about it. We like the generation business at NRG and the valuation is almost back to interesting, but we’d probably have to see turnover in the C-suite and a refreshed corporate strategy to reignite our enthusiasm.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Utility Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:11 Best Communication Stocks to Buy10 Best Used Car Stocks to Buy15 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure: None. 16 Best Utility Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

37,4a75b2fe-2ffc-3ddc-ba26-f824186e07f0,CRM,2023-03-30,Salesforce.com (CRM) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-com-crm-considered-good-133001617.html,1680096601,STORY,['CRM'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Salesforce.com (CRM).Salesforce.com currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.81, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 37 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.81 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 37 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 22 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 59.5% and 5.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CRMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Salesforce.com here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Salesforce.com, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in CRM?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Salesforce.com, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 56% over the past month to $7.11.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Salesforce.com. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Salesforce.com may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company also remains well positioned from its recent acquisition of HEYDUDE.Digital Sales: Key FactorCROX increased its focus on the Crocs mobile app and global social platforms which aided its digital sales. In the fourth quarter, the company’s digital sales advanced 80% year over year, indicating significant growth from the prior-year quarter’s figure of 41%. The metric represented 45.1% of total revenues, up from the year-ago quarter’s figure of 40.3%. This growth was driven by refined user experience, new products and marketing activities.What Else Is Driving GrowthThe company recently added HEYDUDE to its portfolio of brands. Crocs hopes to boost the value of its quickly expanding footwear business with this acquisition. This is the second highly profitable, high-growth brand that Crocs has added to its portfolio.

For 2023, revenues related to the HEYDUDE buyout are likely to grow in mid-20% range on a reported basis. Management remains optimistic about the HEYDUDE brand and expects the brand to attain $1 billion in revenues in 2023.Crocs sandal business is also aiding the company’s growth. During the second half of 2022, the company’s sandal business grew 31% driven by introduction of new products and effective sandal-specific marketing.

    Wednesday, March 29, 2023Microsoft's AI lead is far from guaranteedWhen it comes to generative AI, Microsoft (MSFT) is dominating the conversation. After pouring billions into ChatGPT developer OpenAI, the tech giant is building out a small AI empire, adding the technology to everything from its Dynamics 365 to Office 365, and, of course, Bing. Now Microsoft is bringing generative AI to its cybersecurity offerings via its Microsoft Security Copilot.It's all part of Microsoft’s strategy to ensure that when it comes to the latest generation of AI, it’s the company that you think of first. And it’s working.“They are clearly out in front of everybody else,” Frank Dickson, group VP of security and trust at International Data Corporation, told Yahoo Finance.But a head start doesn’t mean that Microsoft will stay in the lead forever. Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is making big bets of its own, while Facebook parent Meta (META) is building a team of engineers to focus on the generative AI space.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has give the company a lead in the AI wars. (REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch)“This is a baseball game,” Dickson said. “Microsoft is throwing the first pitch right now. The other team hasn't shown up for the game. And so we don't know when they're gonna show up for the game, and we don't know what they're going to bring to that game.”The competition is comingMicrosoft’s big AI moves came at just the right time for the tech giant. It debuted its OpenAI-powered Bing search engine and Edge web browser in February as ChatGPT’s popularity exploded into the mainstream.It kept riding that wave earlier this month when it announced that Bing hit a total of 100 million daily active users and that the software is running on OpenAI’s latest GPT-4 model.By contrast, Google flubbed the debut of its competing generative AI chatbot Bard, with even employees calling the announcement “botched,” according to CNBC.Story continuesBut Google has been packing different types of AI into nearly all of its products for years. And the fact that it debuted Bard a day before Bing and its AI assistant for Workspaces two days before Microsoft’s Office 365 Copilot, proves that it’s not willing to take Microsoft’s incursion into the AI space lying down.Even more troublesome for Microsoft, though, is the fact that the attention it’s brought to generative AI is helping to spawn a host of other potential rivals.“In driving so much excitement and attention around generative AI, you know, [Microsoft has] obviously driven a lot of new prospects and customers to themselves,” Forrester Analyst Rowan Curran told Yahoo Finance.Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, a startup whose technology is behind Microsoft's new AI-powered search engine, speaks at an event in Redmond, Washington, U.S., February 7, 2023. (REUTERS/Jeffrey Dastin)“But they've also really excited the market and driven a huge acceleration in the investment and development of generative AI capabilities across a whole host of other companies,” he said.Microsoft can still take advantage of its leadWhile the competition is clearly coming for Microsoft, the company can still make use of its current lead to grab precious market share from its biggest rivals.“The last few months have made clear that Microsoft has been feverishly working behind the scenes, as has OpenAI, of course, at pushing the envelope on what is possible as it relates to generative AI and integrating it pervasively across their product portfolio,” Mizuho Analyst Gregg Moskowitz told Yahoo Finance.Microsoft is already the second largest cloud provider behind industry leader Amazon (AMZN) and ahead of third place contender Google, and adding its generative AI capabilities could make it all the more attractive to potential customers. That’s especially important as cloud revenue growth slows from its pandemic highs.In Q2 2023, Microsoft’s Azure platform revenue grew 26% year-over-year, down from 46% growth in Q2 2022. Rolling generative AI into the mix, though, could help buoy the business.“This is just the first step on the AI front as we expect much more cloud integration with Azure during the course of 2023 as its AI arms race takes place among Big Tech,” Wedbush Managing Director Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance.To stay on top, Microsoft will have to continue to steal attention away from its rivals while building out its AI capabilities across its offerings. If it doesn’t, Google will be happy to take its place.By Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Nears Deal for Harry Potter Video SeriesSwiss Prosecutors Probe Credit Suisse Deal, Job Cuts SeenBillionaire Blocked From His New Palace Blasts ‘Socialist’ IndiaOil Surges Most in a Year After OPEC+’s Shocking Production CutMore than 1,100 people in the industry signed a petition calling for a six-month break from training artificial intelligence systems more powerful than the latest iteration behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT, in order to allow for the development of shared safety protocols.“Recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control,” said an open letter published on the Future of Life Institute website. “Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.”The call comes after the launch of a series of AI projects in the last several months that convincingly perform human tasks such as writing emails and creating art. Microsoft Corp.-backed OpenAI released its GPT-4 this month, a major upgrade of its AI-powered chatbot, capable of telling jokes and passing tests like the bar exam.It also highlights ongoing tensions between Musk and OpenAI. The nonprofit research lab was founded in 2015 with Musk as co-chair along with Sam Altman, who is also OpenAI’s chief executive officer. At the time, OpenAI’s goal was to “advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.”Story continuesMusk, who runs multiple companies including Tesla Inc., left OpenAI’s board in 2018. He has criticized the organization, which created a for-profit arm in 2019, saying it has become a “closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft,” and that it has “strayed very far from the path of virtue.” Musk has also been looking into creating a rival research lab, according to The Information. Meanwhile, in a recent podcast with tech journalist Kara Swisher, Altman said Musk is a “jerk” while noting he believes Musk is “feeling very stressed about what the future’s going to look like for humanity.”Altman — whose name appeared on the list of signatories Tuesday night — didn’t sign the petition, said OpenAI spokesperson Hannah Wong. “Also I think it’s important to point out that we spent more than six months — after GPT-4 finished training — on the safety and alignment of the model,” Wong said.Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft are among the companies using artificial intelligence to enhance their search engines, while Morgan Stanley has been using GPT-4 to create a chatbot for its wealth advisers.Developers should work with policymakers to create new AI governance systems and oversight bodies, according to the letter. It called on governments to intervene in the development of AI systems if major players don’t imminently agree to a public, verifiable pause.“AI research and development should be refocused on making today’s powerful, state-of-the-art systems more accurate, safe, interpretable, transparent, robust, aligned, trustworthy and loyal,” it said.Yoshua Bengio, the founder and scientific director of Canadian AI research institute Mila, signed the petition, according to a statement from the institute. Emad Mostaque, founder and CEO of Stability AI, also said he signed it.“We have seen the amazing capabilities of GPT-4 and other massive models. Those making these have themselves said they could be an existential threat to society and even humanity, with no plan to totally mitigate these risks,” Mostaque said. “It is time to put commercial priorities to the side and take a pause for the good of everyone to assess rather than race to an uncertain future.”The Future of Life Institute is a nonprofit that seeks to mitigate risks associated with powerful technologies and counts the Musk Foundation as its biggest contributor.“All of the top signatories on the list have been independently verified,” said Anthony Aguirre, a spokesperson for the institute. “Doing so for the whole list exceeds our capacity.”A spokesperson for the Center for Humane Technology, whose executive director, Tristan Harris, signed the letter, said steps are being taken to prevent fake signatures. New signatories are now requiring human review before going up on the site, and all high-profile signatories listed have been vetted by direct communication, the spokesperson said in an email.--With assistance from Ed Ludlow, Dina Bass, Mark Bergen and Dana Hull.(Updates with tensions betweens Musk and OpenAI in the fifth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Undercover Organizers Behind America’s Union WinsDungeons &amp; Dragons’ Epic Quest to Finally Make MoneyThe Texas Preacher’s $24 Million Ponzi SchemeJohn Wick’s Blowout Opening Lifts Lions Gate, But It Won’t Fix StarzUS and Europe Wrangle Over Green Subsidies to Avoid a Trade War©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

As such, the price of the stock isn't as big of a factor as it may have been in the past.Instead, the quality of a company's business, its competitive advantages, and its future earnings growth potential matters far more to a stock price.Buying blue chips with growth potential and competitive advantages is often times better than buying an average stock in the long term as blue chips are generally well known and established companies that are profitable.In terms of growth, some leading technology blue chip stocks have potential future growth potential.Many investors think that artificial intelligence will be the fourth industrial revolution and one that will allow the world to produce substantially more products and services as well as innovative products.

Although no one knows for sure which companies will succeed and which ones won't, the big tech companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Amazon.com, Inc.

We believe these additional measures are indicators of our core business operations’ performance period over period. Adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and EBITDA are not calculated through the application of U.S. GAAP and are not required forms of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). As such, they should not be considered a substitute for the U.S. GAAP measures of net income and diluted earnings per share, and, therefore, they should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the U.S. GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.Business OutlookOur outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2023 (""fiscal 2023"") incorporates current assumptions and market conditions. Changes in the macroeconomic environment could alter our guidance. With consideration of these impacts, we have updated our guidance as follows:Management Solutions revenue is now anticipated to grow by approximately 8%;Interest on funds held for clients is now expected to be in the range of $100 million to $105 million;Other income is now anticipated to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million;Adjusted diluted earnings per share(1) is now anticipated to grow in the range of 13% to 14%.Other aspects of our guidance for fiscal 2023 remain unchanged from what we provided previously.(1)Adjusted diluted earnings per share is not a U.S. GAAP measure.

Our Brooke DiPalma has been following that hearing all day. Brooke, some fiery exchanges between the senators and Howard Schultz. What stood out to you?BROOKE DIPALMA: Well, certainly, lots stood out to me in a more than three-hour hearing that took place today. Schultz responded to questions across the aisle, some rewarding his and the company's success, others calling him straight-up wrong. Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders hit the ground running, accusing the coffee chain of illegal union-busting activities.BERNIE SANDERS: On the other hand, we have a corporation worth some $113 billion, largely controlled by an individual worth some $4 billion, who are using their unlimited resources to do everything possible, legal and illegal, to deny these workers their constitutional right to form a union.BROOKE DIPALMA: Now, from the get-go, Howard Schultz, who stepped down as CEO last week, said he wanted to set the tone that Starbucks has not broken the law. And when asked by Senator Sanders if he could agree to exchange proposals with the union within 14 days of the hearing, Schultz responded that the company has been trying to do that, but has been met with challenges.HOWARD SCHULTZ: Because the arrangement that was made by the union and the NLRB in Buffalo to negotiate one single store at a time, we have met over 85 times for a single store. We've tried to arrange over 350 separate meetings. We've said publicly and I say it here again that we believe that face-to-face negotiations is the way to proceed. And the reason I want to make that point is that there have been safety issues in which Starbucks' managers have been outed on social media. There are privacy issues. We don't want to do it on Zoom. We are prepared to meet face to face on a single-store issue.Story continuesBROOKE DIPALMA: And in response to Starbucks' hometown senator, Seattle-based Senator Murray, Schultz said he believes that a person at Starbucks has the right to decide if they want to join a union, but Starbucks' vision is a preference to maintain a direct relationship with partners, which it calls its employees. And later on, one of those partners took the stand. That was Maggie Carter. And she works at one of the first locations to unionize in Knoxville, Tennessee. She responded on why she felt encouraged to unionize.MAGGIE CARTER: The wages and, you know, rent rising in our state is just not something that worked for us. And also, benefits are just too expensive for us to actually be able to use. So rather than forego a paycheck, we just choose not to have health insurance. So those are a lot of the reasons why we chose to organize. And I'll say Howard Schultz does not feel like a partner to me.BROOKE DIPALMA: Now, Schultz does remain on the board, but these issues largely fall under the scope of new CEO Laxman Narasimhan, who took the helm last week. And as of now, there have been no conclusions reached. But Wall Street not reacting to much of this. Shares up just 1%.- What happens next?BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah, that's a great question. And that's something that I asked an analyst on Wall Street of Wedbush as well. And he particularly said that this is a small amount of companies. It's only more than 290 of 9,000 US company-owned stores at Starbucks. And so Starbucks will keep coming to the table. They want face-to-face. Then the unions have to agree-- the stores, rather, that voted yes to unionize. And he said that it may take a long time for these companies-- rather, these stores to reach a conclusion, to reach some sort of agreement.But he also noted that this is baked in. At some point, this comes an incremental cost of business to Starbucks, and that it's going to be baked into margins, valuations, and expectations. So lots of fallout from this.- And Bill Cassidy, Republican senator, wanted to make clear that they have some issues with the National Labor Relations Board. They feel they have politicized this fight and have taken a side here. So that will continue that fight as well. Excellent reporting. Thank you, Brooke. Good to see you.]"

Starbucks founder and former CEO Howard Schultz repeated the coffee chain’s union-busting talking points in an often contentious Senate labor committee hearing on March 29, as lawmakers asked him about the roughly 130 violations of labor laws submitted by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in the last 18 months.Schultz “unequivocally” denied breaking any labor laws, despite documented examples of union busting compiled by the NLRB, which included the closing of unionized Starbucks locations and the firing of some workers involved in organizing, who were accused of unrelated misconduct.Read moreChatGPT is getting more nuancedChina is changing its tune on the mRNA vaccineA fresh idea for gathering remote and hybrid employees togetherSenator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said Schultz’s refusal to admit any wrongdoing was akin to a motorist who had been pulled over for speeding 100 separate times, and then claimed that the officer had gotten it wrong every time.Unionized Starbucks workers at 300 stores still don’t have a contractSchultz, who explored a bid for the White House in 2019, maintained that his anti-union stance was about prioritizing personal relationships with/ / employees.“We want to treat everyone with respect and dignity,” Schultz said. “However, I have the right, and the company has the right, to have a preference. And our preference is to maintain the direct relationship we’ve had with our employees, who we call partners.”The Seattle-based company has failed to reach a contract with the nearly 300 unionized Starbucks stores, with some waiting well over a year to negotiate a first contract.Schultz cited the company’s desire to conduct bargaining sessions in person (as opposed to remotely or in a hybrid setting, as the union had proposed) as the main obstacle to meeting with unionized employees, something the NLRB has said is an unlawful requirement for negotiations. Senator Bernie Sanders, the progressive independent who chairs the committee, gave Starbucks a deadline of 14 days to exchange initial proposals with the union.Story continuesSanders also pressed Schultz on reports that the executive told a Starbucks employee in favor of unionizing to go work someplace else. Schultz denied the account, saying he told the employee that, if they didn’t like the company, they “could” go work someplace else.Even a republican senator said Starbucks’ average wage is nothing to brag aboutIn his opening comments, Schultz touted the $17.50 average hourly wage for Starbucks employees/ / noting it was more than $4 above the $13.18 minimum wage in Sanders’ home state of Vermont. (The minimum wage at Starbucks, meanwhile is $15 an hour.)Republican senator Mike Braun of Indiana wasn’t impressed with Schultz’s statistics. “Even $17 an hour, that’s not a living wage in this day and age,” Braun said during his questioning of Schultz. “A large corporation shouldn’t necessarily be bragging about $15 to $20 wages. When you look at the typical structure of a large company, that should probably be $20-plus.”Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, expressed disappointment that Schultz only agreed to testify under threat of a subpoena, calling him out of touch with the needs of his employees.“All across America, workers are saying they’ve had enough. Rising inequality and outlandish CEO pay for those at the top–like you–and a paycheck-to-paycheck subsistence for everyone else,” Markey said, citing rising public support for union organizing. “So, as you sit here denigrating your workers, you’re not just morally and legally wrong, you’re in the minority.”Unionizing at Starbucks, by the numbers$15: The starting wage for Starbucks employees. According to the company, the average wage is $17.50.$3.7 billion: Schultz’s net worth/./$8.8 million: The signing bonus and stock awards for Laxman Narasimhan, Starbucks’s new CEO, in his contract to succeed Schultz.504: The number of individual unfair labor practice charges the NLRB general counsel has filed against Starbucks.282: The number of unionized Starbucks locations certified by the NLRB as of mid-February. The board also certified 56 votes against forming a union, giving unionization efforts at Starbucks a success rate of over 90%.Is it legal for union organizers to apply for jobs at non-unionized companies?During his testimony, Schultz accused an employee who was partly responsible for the first unionization drive at Starbucks—at a store in Buffalo, New York—of being associated with union organizers before accepting a position with Starbucks. This is an example of “salting,” the common practice of a union organizer taking a job at a non-unionized workplace to directly inform employees about the benefits of joining a labor union.While Schultz admitted the employee was hired on their own merit, he used the tactic as evidence of unsavory behavior by union organizers. Senator Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, agreed, saying it was evidence of bad practice by Workers United, the union that has been organizing Starbucks employees.But the practice of salting was declared perfectly legal by the US Supreme Court in NLRB v. Town &amp; Country Electric, Inc, and any attempt to fire or refuse to hire a “salt” is illegal under federal labor law.Related stories🖥️ Why does Starbucks want to negotiate with unionized workers in person and not on Zoom?☕ Starbucks’ union-busting tactics are facing the heat⚖️ Bernie Sanders will finally get a chance to grill Starbucks’ Howard Schultz on union-bustingMore from QuartzThe split of the African plate could gift six landlocked countries a coastlineHow Credit Suisse’s demise strengthens Switzerland’s place in global financeSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Analysts at two Wall Street firms, TD Cowen and BTIG, reiterated their high ratings for the company and said respectively that the hearing was a ""non-event"" and ""accomplished little.""Schultz, who left his third stint as CEO on March 20, said he did not have any direct role in firing workers who supported the union or closing unionized stores. He remains on the company's board.His return to Starbucks as its interim leader in April 2022 was ""95% focused on the operations of the business"" and his involvement in the company's union strategy has been ""de minimis,"" Schultz said.Republicans defended Schultz, praising the company's competitive wages, health benefits, employee stock purchase program and other benefits.Story continuesRepublican Senator Mitt Romney noted ""some irony to a non-coffee-drinking Mormon conservative defending a Democrat candidate for president in perhaps one of the most liberal companies in America.""Other senators questioned why it was taking so long for Starbucks to reach contracts with its stores in Buffalo, New York, which were the first in the United States to unionize.""The delay is truly unacceptable,"" Senator Maggie Hassan said.But the company and union disagree over whether negotiation sessions can be conducted via Zoom video calls.Schultz reiterated that the company has ""shown up about 85 times to have a face-to-face meeting"" and tried to set up 365 additional meetings.""We are ready and able to have face-to-face negotiations, and will do so at a moment's notice,"" he said.(Reporting by Hilary Russ in New York and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Jonathan Oatis)]"

No one gave it to me. And I have shared it” with workers.When asked by Sanders if he had ever “threatened, coerced or intimidated” a worker, Schultz was more equivocal.“I’ve had conversations that could have been interpreted in a different way than I intended,” Schultz said.The NLRB’s general counsel issued a complaint last year alleging that Schultz’s comments to a worker in a meeting constituted an illegal threat. The worker told Bloomberg News that Schultz asked, “If you hate Starbucks so much why don’t you go work somewhere else?”“That’s not exactly what I said,” the ex-CEO told the committee, later adding that the employee had a “disruptive mentality.” Schultz said what he told the worker was “if you hate the company, you could work somewhere else,” and that his comment “was not a threat.”Story continuesTesty Back-and-ForthThroughout the sometimes-testy back-and-forth with lawmakers, Schultz, who drank from a Starbucks-branded cup, said the company respects the right to organize but prefers to deal with employees directly without a union.“I have the right, and the company has the right, to have a preference, and our preference is to maintain the direct relationship,” he said. Unlike other companies in the past where unions served a useful role, Schultz said, “we do nothing that is nefarious.”Starbucks’s home-state senator, Washington Democrat Patty Murray, joined in the grilling, saying she has been “disappointed” hearing employees’ “really troubling reports” about anti-union conduct.Schultz agreed to testify before the committee this month after Sanders scheduled a vote on a subpoena that would have forced the executive to appear. Schultz had been set to step down as CEO at the end of the month, but instead left his position two weeks early. He remains on the company’s board.Sanders opened the hearing by citing broad statistics on yawning income inequality and rising interest in organizing among US workers.“In order to combat this increase in union organizing corporations have engaged in an unprecedented level of illegal union-busting activities,” he said. “Over the past 18 months, Starbucks has waged the most aggressive and illegal union-busting campaign in the modern history of our country. That union-busting campaign has been led by Howard Schultz.”Republicans repeatedly rose to the company’s defense during the hearing. The committee’s top Republican, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, described the proceeding as “a smear campaign” against Schultz and Starbucks “based upon allegations that everyone knows are still under litigation.” He urged the committee to also explore allegations of misconduct by the NLRB itself.Such allegations raise a question, Cassidy said: “Are NLRB employees weaponizing the agency against American employers to benefit politically connected labor unions?”The hearing has drawn unusual levels of attention. Over 100 people, including Starbucks employees there to support the union or the company leadership, lined the halls waiting to enter the hearing an hour before it was scheduled to start.The union Workers United has prevailed in elections at around 300 of Starbucks’s roughly 9,000 corporate-owned US cafes over the previous 16 months, spreading from an initial landmark victory in Buffalo, New York, to sites throughout the country. But none of the newly unionized cafes has come close to securing a collective bargaining agreement with the company, and the pace of new unionization petitions has slowed down, as workers allege the company has been retaliating in stores and stonewalling at the bargaining table.US National Labor Relations Board prosecutors have issued over 80 complaints against Starbucks, accusing the company of illegal anti-union tactics including threats, store shutdowns, and terminations of dozens of activists. Administrative law judges have issued nine rulings against the company over the past year. US federal judges have ordered the company to reinstate fired workers in Tennessee and Michigan, and NLRB members have ruled that the company illegally retaliated against workers in Philadelphia and refused to negotiate with union members in Seattle.Starbucks has said repeatedly that all claims of anti-union behavior are “categorically false,” and is appealing many of the rulings. The company said recently that many of the labor board’s cases against it constitute efforts to establish new labor law precedents, in situations where the company is already complying with existing labor law. “Where partners have been subject to discipline, those partners engaged in misconduct contrary to Starbucks policies and procedures,” Schultz said in written testimony submitted to the committee.--With assistance from Leslie Patton, Tatyana Monnay and Diego Areas Munhoz.(Updates with additional testimony starting in second paragraph.

(NYSE:NRG) was covered in the 2019 letter with VST. We sold the shares as COVID induced volatility presented better risk/reward opportunities, but never subsequently repurchased shares—as we did with VST. Not only do we think VST is a better value, but the management team at NRG appears to have gone astray. Despite coming to his position during an activist campaign by Elliott Management in 2017, when the prior empire-building CEO was shown the door, the replacement CEO has seemingly embarked on the same failed strategy. In early December they announced the purchase of Vivint Smart Home, a smart home platform company, for $2.8 billion. The transaction diversifies NRG’s business, increases leverage, dramatically reduces intermediate-term shareholder capital returns, and most importantly, is the opposite of what management told us they were going to do when they assumed the role in 2017. The stock fell 15% on the day of the announcement and is down another 5% since then, and now 10% lower than when we first wrote about it. We like the generation business at NRG and the valuation is almost back to interesting, but we’d probably have to see turnover in the C-suite and a refreshed corporate strategy to reignite our enthusiasm.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Utility Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:11 Best Communication Stocks to Buy10 Best Used Car Stocks to Buy15 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure: None. 16 Best Utility Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Companies administered the survey to employees, and those with a high participation rate were invited to submit information about their engagement strategy including leadership philosophy, communication strategies, and knowledge management approach.This year’s meta-analysis marks the most comprehensive workplace study ever conducted, with survey data compiled from more than 2 million employees in 276 organizations around the world. Gallup found that GEWA winners’ employees are highly engaged – worldwide, only 21% of employees report feeling connected to their work, while 72% of employees at GEWA winning organizations are engaged. Higher levels of employee engagement correlated to better performance in important outcomes including customer ratings, profitability, productivity, turnover, safety incidents, shrinkage, absenteeism, quality, wellbeing and organizational citizenship.For more information about the GEWA and employee engagement, visit the Gallup website.About GallupGallup delivers analytics and advice to help leaders and organizations solve their most pressing problems.

He rejoins the bank on April 5, replacing Ralph Hamers, who has been on the job for only about two years and played a key role in purchasing stricken rival Credit Suisse earlier this month.The Swiss-born Ermotti (Hamers comes from the Netherlands) led UBS successfully for nine years until 2020 and is credited with shrinking the company's investment bank to reduce risk, as well as an expansion of its wealth-management franchise.""Sergio is the right man at the right time for the job,"" a person familiar with UBS's thinking and Ermotti tells Yahoo Finance. ""He is an investment banker first, and that will be very helpful in winding down Credit Suisse's investment bank and integrating other areas.""After much speculation and concern about a banking crisis, UBS made its play for Credit Suisse earlier this month for a total purchase price of $3.2 billion.UBS sees the deal contributing to earnings growth by 2027. The Credit Suisse investment bank is expected to be wound down. The bank sees annualized cost savings of $8 billion by 2027 — mostly through layoffs. And both banks have unrestricted access to the Swiss National Bank's existing facilities.The integration is expected to take three to four years.UBS shares are up roughly 6% since the deal was announced on March 19.The source adds that Ermotti — known to go deep on execution and stay close to key personnel — is likely to focus in his first 90 days back on understanding the risks and exposures of the Credit Suisse investment banking business.Another area of Ermotti's early attention is likely to be the retention of important Credit Suisse employees in wealth management and investment banking.Story continues""If he sees key personnel being poached, he will make the case to that person to stay,"" the source said.Further, as a Swiss citizen, Ermotti may be more sympathetic to a layoff timeline and how the Swiss public is feeling on the deal and can uniquely and effectively communicate that, the source noted.Over time, 20,000 to 25,000 jobs from Credit Suisse may be cut, the source estimated. The company has more than 50,000 employees.Wall Street appears to be positive on Ermotti's return, with UBS shares up over 3.5% in early trading.Sergio Ermotti, newly rehired CEO of UBS Group AG attends a news conference in Zurich, Switzerland March 29, 2023. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth""UBS's priorities have clearly changed, with the integration of CS being the most important task. In addition, UBS is already facing significant political pressure due to its large size and importance for the country. The question 'what to do with CS Switzerland?' has already triggered a heated debate. We welcome the appointment of Sergio Ermotti and believe that he is right person for the challenging task, given his experience of successfully transforming UBS after the Global Financial Crisis,"" Andreas Venditti said in a client note.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

OMCL is well poised for growth in coming quarters owing to its planned geographic expansion. The company recorded better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of 2022. A strong solvency position is another upside. However, stiff competition and mounting operating expenses raise apprehension.In the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 58.9% compared with a 43.8% fall of the industry and a 14.9% drop of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical device solutions provider has a market capitalization of $2.44 billion. Its fourth-quarter 2022 earnings remarkably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 266.7%. The long-term expected growth rate is estimated at 13.9% compared with the industry’s projection of 18.6%.Let’s delve deeperQ4 Upsides: Omnicell ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Adjusted earnings for the quarter exceeded OMCL’s revised guidance (projected between 5 and 15 cents) due to increased revenues, the lower cost of sales, solid expense management and lower performance-based compensations. The quarterly revenues also beat the previous guidance range of $285-295 million, which buoy optimism. The robust market demand for Omnicell’s Advanced Services is also encouraging. The company’s newest launch of Specialty Pharmacy Services is expected to boost its portfolio by providing enhanced clinical and business outcomes for customers across all care settings.Planned Geographic Expansion Another Upside: Outside the United States, healthcare providers are becoming increasingly aware of the benefits of automation. Additionally, there is a substantial demand for adherence packaging equipment outside the domestic market. Many government and private entities are aware of the progress made over the last several years in the United States and are investing significantly in information technology and automation. Given the fact that the international market is less than 1% penetrated, with very few hospitals adopting medication control systems, Omnicell has specified its second leg of strategies for expanding into new markets.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInternationally, Omnicell continues to gain momentum in Asia with recent medication management, automation and customer increments in Singapore and Japan.Strong Liquidity, Solvency and Capital Structure: Omnicell exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion compared with $1.09 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Meanwhile, the company did not report any debt on its balance sheet at the end of the fourth quarter. This is good news regarding the company’s solvency position, particularly during the year of economic downturn, when it is majorly facing manufacturing and supply disruptions globally.DownsidesEscalating Costs and Expenses: Omnicell has adopted several strategies to drive its top line, including portfolio expansion, acquisitions and further penetration in the medication adherence market. The company continues to battle escalating costs. In the fourth quarter, the adjusted gross profit declined 18.4% year over year. The adjusted gross margin contracted 710 basis points (bps) to 40.9%. Operating expenses were up 16.3% year over year. The operating loss in the quarter totaled $38.4 million compared to the operating profit of $11.5 million in the year-ago quarter.Competitive Landscape: Omnicell faces intense competition in the medication management and supply chain solutions market. Even though the company continues to gain market share from other traditional providers of medication management and supply chain solutions, major players such as Becton Dickinson/CareFusion Corporation, ARxIUM, Cerner Corporation, Talyst, Inc., Emerson Electronic Co., WaveMark Inc.Estimate TrendIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Omnicell’s 2023 earnings has moved down by 23% to $1.65.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.17 billion, suggesting a 9.7% fall from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

ILMN recently announced the launch of Connected Insights -- a new cloud-based software that enables tertiary analysis for clinical next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Connected Insights is commercially available in a limited number of countries and is undergoing beta testing in the United States.The recent launch will expand Illumina’s portfolio of oncology testing.More on Illumina Connected SoftwareIllumina Connected Software is an end-to-end software system that standardizes analysis tools and connects data across the genomics workflow. The software is intended to streamline interpretation and reporting from a range of assay types, allowing labs to scale the use of NGS and reduce the turnaround time of clinical reporting.The software’s initial release will support somatic oncology applications, matching the growing use of comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) for advanced tumors. The software will also include whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for rare diseases soon.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, Connected Insights enables labs to connect to a network of more than 45 third-party knowledge sources that provide digital directories for precision oncology, illustrating connections between cancer variants and therapies, citing evidence, and aiding analysis of complex cancer genomic profiles.Benefits of the Connected SoftwareWith the increasing demand for NGS testing in health care systems, the need for interpretation of large genomic data sets with complex health implications in a landscape of frequently changing guidelines and drug approvals has become critical. Per management, Connected Insights complements Illumina’s suite of NGS solutions to generate, analyze, annotate, and interpret data consistently today and into the future.Connected Insights is the subsequent step in creating a fully-integrated software ecosystem that scales with the pace of discovery across NGS applications. Building on Illumina’s platforms of proven SBS technology with DRAGEN secondary analysis, Illumina Connected Insight allows its users to bring a variety of knowledgebases and data together to discover clinical relevance.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global next-generation sequencing market size was estimated at $4.84 billion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 12.4%. Factors such as extensive adoption of NGS technologies in clinical diagnostics due to rapid result time and faster processing and rowing technological developments in NGS instruments and technologies are fuelling the market.Strong Growth in Oncology SpaceIn 2022, Illumina’s oncology testing consumables grew 7% year-over-year from the utilization of MGS-based molecular profiling across early detection, therapy selection and minimal residual disease. The company witnessed increasing opportunities for its oncology products globally. For the TruSight Oncology 500 distributed therapy selection assay, sample volume grew about 60% year over year across more than 500 accounts. For 2023, the company expects more than $100 million in revenue for TSO 500.The company is witnessing stronger-than-expected clinical adoption and orders from new to high-throughput customers who are bringing sequencing in-house due to NovaSeq X's ease of use and cost benefits. The NovaSeq X has had the strongest pre-order book of any Illumina instrument launch, and this demand will catalyze a multiyear upgrade cycle.In oncology, GRAIL continues to have strong demand from consumers, physicians, health systems and payers. Galleri is the only multi-cancer early-detection test in a $40-plus billion market, and it had the fastest first-year revenue ramp in cancer screening test history. In 2022, more than 4,500 providers ordered the test, contributing to the more than 60,000 Galleri test orders that have been received to date. GRAIL expects this exciting momentum to continue and to translate into an expected revenue CAGR of 60% to 90% over the next five years.Share PriceIn the past year, Illumina has outperformed its industry.

SRDX announced its receipt of positive formal feedback from the FDA regarding its proposed approach to submit an amended premarket approval (PMA) application for the SurVeil drug-coated balloon (DCB). The company had earlier received another letter from the FDA in January, where the agency had indicated that the PMA application for the SurVeil DCB was not currently approvable while providing specific guidance on a path forward.Following the receipt of the earlier letter, Surmodics prepared and submitted a Submission Issue Request (SIR), under the FDA’s Q-Submission Program, to obtain formal feedback on its proposed approach for addressing the FDA letter. The company has also completed a Submission Issue Meeting with the agency to discuss the request and the written feedback.The receipt of positive formal feedback from the FDA raises our optimism about Surmodics’ product and its potential to get the PMA. This is likely to strengthen the company’s foothold in the DCB space.Significance of the FeedbackThe FDA had requested additional clarification related to already-completed biocompatibility studies and revisions to Surmodics’ proposed labeling to amend the PMA application to put it into an approvable form. The FDA noted that the feedback it provided was based on the level of information included in the company’s SIR and that the actual determination for the acceptability of Surmodics’ responses will depend on the information provided in its formal amended PMA application to be filed with the FDA.Per management, the FDA’s feedback will likely provide the essential clarity on the process and content required to successfully amend the PMA application. Management does not anticipate the necessity for additional biocompatibility studies, which will likely significantly reduce Surmodics’ initial assumptions of the time and cost to amend its PMA application.Based on the alignment and clarity provided by the FDA, management is currently preparing the amended PMA application for submission in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The company is targeting to receive the PMA in the fiscal fourth quarter.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Zion Market Research, the global DCB market was worth around $782.4 million in 2021 and is anticipated to reach about $1,819.2 million by 2028 at a CAGR of approximately 15.1%. Factors like the high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and advanced healthcare infrastructure are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest feedback raises optimism about Surmodics.Notable DevelopmentLast month, Surmodics announced its first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein it registered robust revenues from its Medical Device segment, as well as from its Product sales, and royalties and license fees. During the quarter, Surmodics witnessed strong contributions from sales of its Pounce and Sublime products, indicating their continued solid demand.Price PerformanceShares of Surmodics have lost 50.1% in the past year compared with the industry’s 41.1% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 14.9% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Surmodics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The law takes effect June 26.Chevron, the largest oil refiner by volume in the state, called the measure ""a step backward"" and its approval ""likely to result in less reliable, less affordable fuel for state motorists,"" said spokesperson Ross Allen.Energy investment firm Tudor Pickering &amp; Holt said this week that independent refiner PBF Energy has the largest single exposure in the California market with 32% of its refining capacity in the state.PBF did not respond to a request for comment.""Refiners will also have to report more information to the watchdog,"" said Matthew Blair, Tudor Pickering's managing director of refiners, chemicals, and renewable fuels research.California is the largest U.S. market for motor fuels but has some of the highest retail prices because it is isolated from Gulf Coast and Midwest refining centers.This makes California reliant on a shrinking number of West Coast refineries and fuel imports from Asia and Europe.Those limits make the state vulnerable to plant outages and spikes in crude oil prices such as the summer and fall of 2022.The law will do nothing to increase gasoline supply to the West Coast, said John Auers, managing director of Refined Fuels Analytics. ""It won't do any good and it will do harm.""The uncertainty of possible penalties will weigh on the industry, said David Hackett, chairman of fuels consulting firm Stillwater Associates.""I think that's exactly what they are doing: Death by a thousand cuts.""

80,d265ccdb-47e3-345b-8a3b-a46cc500a7a9,M,2023-03-30,UPDATE 1-US natgas falls 2% to 30-month low below $2/mmBtu on mild weather,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-us-natgas-falls-2-190139090.html,1680116499,STORY,['M'],"[(Adds latest prices) March 29 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures fell about 2% to a fresh 30-month low on Wednesday in low volume trade with the expiration of the front-month on rising output and mild weather forecasts that should allow utilities to start injecting gas into storage at the beginning of April. ""April natural gas contract trades below $2 into expiration ... as it struggled under the weight of a towering South Central regional storage surplus and (as) thinning trading volumes drove increased volatility risks,"" analysts at energy consulting firm EBW Analytics said in a note. That price decline came even though the amount of gas flowing to liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants was on track to hit a monthly record high in March after Freeport LNG's export plant in Texas exited an eight-month outage in February. Freeport LNG shut in June 2022 due to a fire. On their last day as the front-month, gas futures for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) fell 3.9 cents, or 1.9%, to settle at $1.991 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), their lowest close since September 2020 for a second day in a row. That put the front-month below the psychologically significant $2 per mmBtu and pushed it into technically oversold territory with a relative strength index (RSI) below 30 for the first time since late February. With most traders focused on the May contract, less than 3,500 contracts for April delivery traded on the NYMEX on Wednesday. That compares with a daily average of 127,200 front-month contracts traded since the start of the year. Futures for May, which will now become the front-month, gained about 4 cents to $2.18 per mmBtu. The market has been extremely volatile this month, with the front-month gaining or losing more than 5% on nine of the past 20 trading days. Gas prices were on track to drop about 28% for the month of March and 56% for the first quarter of 2023. Freeport LNG's export plant was on track to pull in about 1.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas on Wednesday, up from 1.6 bcfd on Tuesday, according to Refinitiv data. Energy traders said gas flows at that level likely signal that Freeport LNG started the third of three liquefaction trains at the plant. Liquefaction trains turn gas into LNG for export. On March 8, Freeport LNG said it anticipated feedgas flows would rise and fall as the plant returns to full production over the ""next few weeks."" When operating at full power, Freeport LNG can turn about 2.1 bcfd of gas into LNG for export. Total gas flows to all seven big U.S. LNG export plants rose to an average of 13.1 bcfd so far in March, up from 12.8 bcfd in February. That would top the monthly record of 12.9 bcfd in March 2022, before the Freeport LNG facility shut. SUPPLY AND DEMAND Refinitiv said average gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states rose to 98.6 bcfd so far in March, up from 98.1 bcfd in February. The monthly record is 99.9 bcfd in November 2022. Meteorologists projected the weather in the Lower 48 states would remain mostly near normal through April 13. With warmer spring-like weather expected to reduce the amount of gas burned to heat homes and businesses, Refinitiv forecast U.S. gas demand, including exports, would drop from 110.5 bcfd this week to 104.5 bcfd next week. Mild winter weather allowed utilities to leave more gas in storage so far this year and should let them start injecting fuel into inventories at the beginning of April. Gas stockpiles were about 23% above their five-year average (2018-2022) during the week ended March 17 and were expected to end about 21% above normal during the colder-than-normal week ended March 24, according to federal data and analysts' estimates.

Bids were read at a livestreamed event on Wednesday morning, with Chevron Corp, ExxonMobil Corp and BP Plc among the top buyers.The auction fulfills a provision in President Joe Biden's 2022 climate change law, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), that protects federal oil and gas leasing and requires that a Gulf sale be held by March 31.It was the first in the oil-rich region since late 2021.Biden had pledged to end new leasing during his presidential campaign as part of his goal to decarbonize the U.S. economy by 2050. The United Nations has warned that the world needs to speed up its transition away from fossil fuels to avoid the most extreme effects of climate change.But Biden has faced pressure to increase domestic supplies of oil and gas to reduce price spikes and boost energy security.The auction's high bid total was the largest since a 2017 sale in the Central Gulf area garnered $274.8 million, but the price per acre on Wednesday of $157 was about half what companies paid six years ago.Energy research firm Wood Mackenzie said the results demonstrated optimism for development in the region.About 2.3% of the acreage offered received bids from more than two dozen companies. Of the 313 tracts that received bids, just 30 received two or more bids.Environmental groups including Earthjustice and Friends of the Earth said the government was prioritizing the oil and gas industry above the nation's climate goals and health of Gulf coast communities.An oil and gas industry group, the National Ocean Industries Association, said the sale ""is an opportunity to strengthen our national security interests and develop domestic energy supplies in the face of geopolitical uncertainty and tight global demand.""Story continuesChevron was the auction's biggest spender with nearly $108 million in high bids for 75 tracts. It also made the auction's highest offer of $15.9 million for a tract in the Keathley Canyon deepwater area. The U.S. oil major said it was pleased with the sale results.Exxon snapped up 69 shallow water blocks near the Texas coastline, spending $9.8 million in total. Analysts have said the company may be preparing for a carbon capture and storage project.The company on Wednesday said only that it was ""evaluating the seismic and subsurface geology for future commercial potential.""BP's high bids totaled $46.6 million, while Shell Plc spent $20.1 million and Equinor ASA's high bids amounted to $18.3 million.The leases are for five- or 10-year terms, depending on water depth, and carry royalty rates of 18.75%, a maximum established in the IRA. The rate is an increase for shallow water leases, which in recent sales were offered with a royalty rate of 12.5%. The IRA raised the minimum royalty rate for offshore leases to 16.67%.The Gulf of Mexico accounts for 15% of U.S. oil production and 1% of natural gas production, according to BOEM. Production in the region is expected to keep growing through 2027, according to a 2022 BOEM forecast.

And US natural gas prices have tumbled 80% from an August high.Meanwhile, a separate index reading from the survey showed oil production remained positive but slowed, falling to 10.5 from 25.8, with the natural gas production index sinking to 7.4 from 29.4.""Growth in the oil and gas sector slowed to a crawl in the first quarter, as firms' faced increasing costs,"" Michael Plante, Dallas Fed senior research economist, said in a statement.

Two of four new projects aiming for a financial okay this quarter have been pushed back, and others will face that higher bar, said analysts.The pair that have gone ahead - Venture Global LNG's project in Louisiana and Sempra Energy's in Texas - embody what analysts say have met the new requirements: less reliance on developer's equity and more on fully contracted capacity.Both projects won approvals with strong corporate financing - $7.8 billion for Venture Global and $6.8 billion for Sempra - noted Jefferies Group Managing Director of Equities Research Lloyd Byrne.And the pair address volatile gas-price risk by having about 90% of production capacity under long-term deals, Byrne wrote in a report this week. Rivals who are unable to recruit a full contingent of buyers face ""a project stalling or outright cancellation,"" he added.NEW DELAYSEleni Papadopoulou, lead natural gas analyst at commodity data and analytics firm Kpler, said the banking crisis that emerged earlier this month raised ""concerns that banking lending activity might be pulled back,"" she said, and ""delay further FIDs,"" using the acronym for financial investment decision approvals.The proposed NextDecade and Energy Transfer LP export terminals - the two other projects previously aiming for FID in the first quarter - have been repeatedly delayed due to rising construction, labor and borrowing costs, and by the recently narrowing spread between U.S. and global natural gas prices.Story continuesEnergy Transfer pointed to February comments by its co-CEO Thomas Long that it was optimistic its LNG project would go ahead.On Tuesday, French bank Societe Generale SA confirmed it last year had withdrawn as lead bank for NextDecade's Rio Grande LNG project.NextDecade said it had taken on MUFG Bank as a financial advisor last year and retained Macquarie Capital as a second advisor.'HARDER SELL'This month, NextDecade said it aimed for a financial go-ahead for the first phase of Rio Grande before the end of next quarter. Two months earlier it said it expected the decision by March 30.Soaring inflation means ""LNG exporters need to recover their costs via higher liquefaction fees, which is a harder sell now with gas prices collapsing,"" said Stephen Ellis, an energy strategist at Morningstar Research Services LLC.Demand for U.S. LNG increased after several countries slowed purchases of Russian energy and imposed sanctions on Moscow after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.After hitting record highs of around $90 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in Europe and $70 in Asia last summer, gas prices this year plunged to around $13 in Europe and Asia. U.S. gas prices dropped from a high near $10 last summer to $2 today.""Developers have re-evaluated their cost structure and profitability and that, I think, is what is delaying some of these final investment decisions,"" said Ade Allen, an analyst at energy consulting firm Rystad Energy.(Reporting by Scott DiSavino; editing by Gary McWilliams and Chizu Nomiyama)]"

See our latest analysis for General Dynamics How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for General Dynamics is:18% = US$3.4b ÷ US$19b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.18.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.General Dynamics' Earnings Growth And 18% ROEAt first glance, General Dynamics seems to have a decent ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 10% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Despite this, General Dynamics' five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that's limiting the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that General Dynamics' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 4.9% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is GD worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether GD is currently mispriced by the market.Is General Dynamics Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 40% (implying that the company keeps 60% of its income) over the last three years, General Dynamics has seen a negligible amount of growth in earnings as we saw above. So there could be some other explanation in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.Additionally, General Dynamics has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 38% of its profits over the next three years. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 20%.SummaryIn total, it does look like General Dynamics has some positive aspects to its business. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

(NYSE:NRG) was covered in the 2019 letter with VST. We sold the shares as COVID induced volatility presented better risk/reward opportunities, but never subsequently repurchased shares—as we did with VST. Not only do we think VST is a better value, but the management team at NRG appears to have gone astray. Despite coming to his position during an activist campaign by Elliott Management in 2017, when the prior empire-building CEO was shown the door, the replacement CEO has seemingly embarked on the same failed strategy. In early December they announced the purchase of Vivint Smart Home, a smart home platform company, for $2.8 billion. The transaction diversifies NRG’s business, increases leverage, dramatically reduces intermediate-term shareholder capital returns, and most importantly, is the opposite of what management told us they were going to do when they assumed the role in 2017. The stock fell 15% on the day of the announcement and is down another 5% since then, and now 10% lower than when we first wrote about it. We like the generation business at NRG and the valuation is almost back to interesting, but we’d probably have to see turnover in the C-suite and a refreshed corporate strategy to reignite our enthusiasm.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Utility Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:11 Best Communication Stocks to Buy10 Best Used Car Stocks to Buy15 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure: None. 16 Best Utility Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
89,d1b8920b-7b5d-334a-a96e-3391fcdae108,NRG,2023-03-30,3 Carbon Capture Stocks Actually Capturing Carbon,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-carbon-capture-stocks-actually-182752592.html,1679855272,STORY,"['FCEL', 'FLR', 'NRG']","[With the world trying to reach net zero carbon emissions, carbon capture stocks have taken center stage. Not only that, the Biden Administration has already pledged $3.7 billion to help kickstart the industry and achieve climate objectives. However, in order to achieve those objectives, carbon capture will need to be prove itself profitable. Without profit, carbon capture can’t create a virtuous cycle of growth and development.Carbon capture is the process of removing CO2 and either using it for something else or sequestering it. But sequestration is difficult and CO2 has proven less useful than advocates had wished. Thus a successful carbon capture stock needs to have a strong vision of what they can accomplish profitably. And that means understanding both the science and economics of carbon.While many companies talk about carbon capture, very few actually do it. By contrast, these are genuine carbon capture stocks that actually capture carbon. If the carbon capture industry proves its value, you’ll want to bet on the doers, not the talkers. So here’s three carbon capture stocks to keep on your radar.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFCELFuelCell Energy$2.79FLRFluor$29.20NRGNRG Energy$31.49Fuel Cell Energy (FCEL)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockFuel Cell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL) sells, leases, and maintains fuel cells for producing electricity. While many of us learned that hydrogen and oxygen combine to produce water and energy, Fuel Cell Energy has an added twist for capturing carbon. In order to obtain hydrogen, Fuel Cell Energy combines methane with CO2 at ultrahigh temperatures. That hydrogen is then used to produce electricity in fuel cells.Because CO2 is a necessary ingredient, Fuel Cell Energy thinks its carbon capture process can be profitable. It’s important to realize that this process produces carbon dioxide just as much as it consumes it. But the produced CO2 is in a state that makes it easier to sequester instead of releasing it into the atmosphere.Story continuesFor Q1 of 2023, Fuel Cell Energy reported an operating loss of $22.4 million and cash and cash equivalents of $315 million. Their total revenue was $37 million of which “Advanced Technologies” (which includes carbon capture) was $4.4 million. However Advanced Technologies did show 10% growth from Q1 2022.If Fuel Cell Energy is right, then their technology can lead to net zero CO2 production when using methane as an energy source. However the CO2 still needs to be sequestered or it just gets released back into the atmosphere. Fuel Cell Energy also needs to show it can turn a profit. But its Advanced Technologies revenue shows growth and it has plenty of runway with its cash on hand. If Fuel Cell Energy can meet these challenges, it can win big in the net zero future.Fluor (FLR)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Fluor (NYSE:FLR) is an engineering and construction company making its own play in the carbon capture market. It was recently tapped by CarbonCapture (privately held) to help build a facility to remove CO2 directly from the air. Dubbed Project Bison, this complex will sequester the CO2 in deep saltwater aquifers beneath Wyoming.Unlike Fuel Cell Energy, Project Bison won’t directly make money by using CO2. Instead it hopes to sell carbon credits to other companies, getting them to pay it to sequester carbon. Only California currently requires companies to participate in a cap-and-trade carbon market. But if such a strategy goes national it could be a boon to Project Bison and its backers. Fluor is a major construction company, with $13.7 billion in revenue and $427 million in earnings in FY 2022. Carbon capture (part of their Energy Solutions segment) is just a small piece of that pie. But it could grow substantially if demand for carbon offsets increases.Because Fluor’s carbon capture system doesn’t directly monetize the carbon, it is in many ways a bet on the regulatory environment. If more governments follow California in requiring carbon offsets, that could mean more demand for schemes like Project Bison. That in turn would mean more awards for Fluor. But even if such regulations don’t materialize, Fluor is still in a relatively safe position with its other revenue sources. Keep a lookout for more state governments to require carbon offsets, that could make Fluor a hot topic in the near future.NRG Energy (NRG)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comNRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) is a case study in the perils and profits of carbon capture. It is a classic carbon-intensive power company, selling electricity from oil, coal and gas. But their Petra Nova plant was built as a free market solution to CO2: they would use CO2 to extract oil.In 2016, NRG’s Petra Nova system first came online. It captured CO2 waste from NRG’s coal power plant and sent it via pipes for enhanced oil recovery. Because the CO2 was directly used in profitable oil production, NRG claimed that it also boosted their bottom line.However, in 2022 NRG sold the Petra Nova project to Japanese firm Eneos (OTCMKTS:JXHGF) for a small percentage of what they paid for it. NRG cited falling oil prices and rising costs associated with the project. However their briefings still proudly claim that they will continue to pursue carbon capture solutions like Petra Nova. With 2022 total revenue of $31.5 billion, and earnings of $2 billion, they can continue to pursue carbon capture solutions for years to come. And future energy regulations may even force them to.On the date of publication, John Blankenhorn did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If that’s not a reason to consider renewable energy stocks to buy, I don’t know what is.  In fact, according to the IEA, most of the increased demand for electricity over the next three years will be from China and other large Asian economies. The agency estimates demand will increase by 4.6% annually in Asia Pacific, nearly five times the Americas, and eight times the U.S.So, if you’re looking for renewable energy stocks to buy, a good place would be companies already operating renewable energy projects in Asia Pacific and have projects in the pipeline. It could be operators, investors, manufacturers, etc. To find possible options, I’ll use the actively-managed Virtus Duff &amp; Phelps Clean Energy ETF (NYSEARCA:VCLN) for inspiration. It has a manageable 44 holdings and covers clean energy producers, technology and equipment manufacturers for renewable energy, and companies that distribute clean energy.

Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) gives you the best of both worlds. It owns the Florida Power &amp; Light Company, America’s largest utility with 5.8 million customer accounts; it also owns NextEra Energy Resources LLC, the world’s largest wind and solar renewable energy producer. Because this is about renewable energy stocks, I will focus on NextEra Energy. It has 30 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy in operations, including 22 GW of wind (68% of its generation and storage capacity, 5 GW of solar power (14%), 2 GW of nuclear (7%), and 1 GW of battery storage (4%). The remaining 7% is from natural gas and oil. These assets total $71 billion. NextEra Resources has a 19 GW backlog of wind, solar, and storage contracts to keep it busy for the next few years. And that’s not even considering the green hydrogen opportunities it’s undertaking. But, of course, these things all take capital. That’s why NEE spun off NextEra Energy Partners LP (NYSE:NEP) in June 2014. Story continuesAt the time of the spin-off, NEP had nearly 1 GW of contracted energy projects in North America.  Today, it’s approximately 10x that. NEE owns 46.2% of NEP’s operating company.  In the next 3-5 years, NEE’s share price will exceed $100. Yielding a reasonable 2.5%, why not get paid to wait for the business to come to NextEra?Brookfield Renewable (BEPC)An image of a hand holding a light bulb wrapped in leaves, surrounded by green energy source iconsSource: maeching chaiwongwatthana/ShutterstockBrookfield Renewable (NYSE:BEPC), one of the Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM) affiliate businesses, is used to making big acquisitions in the renewable energy space. For example, in Oct. 2022, BEPC partnered strategically with Canadian uranium producer Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) to acquire Westinghouse Electric, one of the world’s largest nuclear services businesses. The price tag? Approximately $7.88 billion, with Brookfield and its institutional partners putting in $2.3 billion equity for 51% of the strategic partnership.On March 20, Brookfield Renewable announced that it would acquire the 50% of Spanish solar power operator X-ELIO that it didn’t already own from KKR &amp; Co. (NYSE:KKR). The deal valued the entire business at $2.68 billion. Once completed, it will own a renewable energy company with 3 GW of capacity. Brookfield finished 2022 with 25,377 MW capacity with more than 110,000 MW in development. In 2022, it generated $4.7 billion in revenue, with funds from operations of $1.01 billion. A Brookfield entity combined with renewable energy equals a very bright future.First Solar (FSLR)Solar penny stocks: a close up of a solar cell farmSource: Fit Ztudio / ShutterstockFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of solar panels. Its stock’s been on quite a run since last July, up 174%, considerably higher than the 4% return from the S&amp;P 500. Of course, it’s an apples-to-oranges comparison, but you can’t help but be impressed with this kind of return.  While the entire sector is hot due to the incentives provided by the Inflation Reduction Act for Americans to buy solar panels and clean energy, First Solar could be a big beneficiary of the legislation, according to UBS analyst Jon Windham. “[First Solar], the most significant beneficiary of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) with high visibility on capacity, revenue and earnings growth through 2026,” Barron’s reported Windham’s comments from early March. First Solar estimates it will receive at least $660 million in IRA tax credits. In 2023, it expects to earn $3.5 billion at the midpoint of its guidance with $7.50 a share in earnings. It currently trades at 28x its 2023 earnings. While that might seem like a high valuation in these markets, First Solar has 67.7 GW of contracted backlog, with 38% of it to be delivered in 2026 and beyond. So it’s got plenty of work to keep it busy. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The law takes effect June 26.Chevron, the largest oil refiner by volume in the state, called the measure ""a step backward"" and its approval ""likely to result in less reliable, less affordable fuel for state motorists,"" said spokesperson Ross Allen.Energy investment firm Tudor Pickering &amp; Holt said this week that independent refiner PBF Energy has the largest single exposure in the California market with 32% of its refining capacity in the state.PBF did not respond to a request for comment.""Refiners will also have to report more information to the watchdog,"" said Matthew Blair, Tudor Pickering's managing director of refiners, chemicals, and renewable fuels research.California is the largest U.S. market for motor fuels but has some of the highest retail prices because it is isolated from Gulf Coast and Midwest refining centers.This makes California reliant on a shrinking number of West Coast refineries and fuel imports from Asia and Europe.Those limits make the state vulnerable to plant outages and spikes in crude oil prices such as the summer and fall of 2022.The law will do nothing to increase gasoline supply to the West Coast, said John Auers, managing director of Refined Fuels Analytics. ""It won't do any good and it will do harm.""The uncertainty of possible penalties will weigh on the industry, said David Hackett, chairman of fuels consulting firm Stillwater Associates.""I think that's exactly what they are doing: Death by a thousand cuts.""

92,d265ccdb-47e3-345b-8a3b-a46cc500a7a9,MA,2023-03-30,UPDATE 1-US natgas falls 2% to 30-month low below $2/mmBtu on mild weather,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-us-natgas-falls-2-190139090.html,1680116499,STORY,['NG=F'],"[(Adds latest prices) March 29 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures fell about 2% to a fresh 30-month low on Wednesday in low volume trade with the expiration of the front-month on rising output and mild weather forecasts that should allow utilities to start injecting gas into storage at the beginning of April. ""April natural gas contract trades below $2 into expiration ... as it struggled under the weight of a towering South Central regional storage surplus and (as) thinning trading volumes drove increased volatility risks,"" analysts at energy consulting firm EBW Analytics said in a note. That price decline came even though the amount of gas flowing to liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants was on track to hit a monthly record high in March after Freeport LNG's export plant in Texas exited an eight-month outage in February. Freeport LNG shut in June 2022 due to a fire. On their last day as the front-month, gas futures for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) fell 3.9 cents, or 1.9%, to settle at $1.991 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), their lowest close since September 2020 for a second day in a row. That put the front-month below the psychologically significant $2 per mmBtu and pushed it into technically oversold territory with a relative strength index (RSI) below 30 for the first time since late February. With most traders focused on the May contract, less than 3,500 contracts for April delivery traded on the NYMEX on Wednesday. That compares with a daily average of 127,200 front-month contracts traded since the start of the year. Futures for May, which will now become the front-month, gained about 4 cents to $2.18 per mmBtu. The market has been extremely volatile this month, with the front-month gaining or losing more than 5% on nine of the past 20 trading days. Gas prices were on track to drop about 28% for the month of March and 56% for the first quarter of 2023. Freeport LNG's export plant was on track to pull in about 1.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas on Wednesday, up from 1.6 bcfd on Tuesday, according to Refinitiv data. Energy traders said gas flows at that level likely signal that Freeport LNG started the third of three liquefaction trains at the plant. Liquefaction trains turn gas into LNG for export. On March 8, Freeport LNG said it anticipated feedgas flows would rise and fall as the plant returns to full production over the ""next few weeks."" When operating at full power, Freeport LNG can turn about 2.1 bcfd of gas into LNG for export. Total gas flows to all seven big U.S. LNG export plants rose to an average of 13.1 bcfd so far in March, up from 12.8 bcfd in February. That would top the monthly record of 12.9 bcfd in March 2022, before the Freeport LNG facility shut. SUPPLY AND DEMAND Refinitiv said average gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states rose to 98.6 bcfd so far in March, up from 98.1 bcfd in February. The monthly record is 99.9 bcfd in November 2022. Meteorologists projected the weather in the Lower 48 states would remain mostly near normal through April 13. With warmer spring-like weather expected to reduce the amount of gas burned to heat homes and businesses, Refinitiv forecast U.S. gas demand, including exports, would drop from 110.5 bcfd this week to 104.5 bcfd next week. Mild winter weather allowed utilities to leave more gas in storage so far this year and should let them start injecting fuel into inventories at the beginning of April. Gas stockpiles were about 23% above their five-year average (2018-2022) during the week ended March 17 and were expected to end about 21% above normal during the colder-than-normal week ended March 24, according to federal data and analysts' estimates.

Bids were read at a livestreamed event on Wednesday morning, with Chevron Corp, ExxonMobil Corp and BP Plc among the top buyers.The auction fulfills a provision in President Joe Biden's 2022 climate change law, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), that protects federal oil and gas leasing and requires that a Gulf sale be held by March 31.It was the first in the oil-rich region since late 2021.Biden had pledged to end new leasing during his presidential campaign as part of his goal to decarbonize the U.S. economy by 2050. The United Nations has warned that the world needs to speed up its transition away from fossil fuels to avoid the most extreme effects of climate change.But Biden has faced pressure to increase domestic supplies of oil and gas to reduce price spikes and boost energy security.The auction's high bid total was the largest since a 2017 sale in the Central Gulf area garnered $274.8 million, but the price per acre on Wednesday of $157 was about half what companies paid six years ago.Energy research firm Wood Mackenzie said the results demonstrated optimism for development in the region.About 2.3% of the acreage offered received bids from more than two dozen companies. Of the 313 tracts that received bids, just 30 received two or more bids.Environmental groups including Earthjustice and Friends of the Earth said the government was prioritizing the oil and gas industry above the nation's climate goals and health of Gulf coast communities.An oil and gas industry group, the National Ocean Industries Association, said the sale ""is an opportunity to strengthen our national security interests and develop domestic energy supplies in the face of geopolitical uncertainty and tight global demand.""Story continuesChevron was the auction's biggest spender with nearly $108 million in high bids for 75 tracts. It also made the auction's highest offer of $15.9 million for a tract in the Keathley Canyon deepwater area. The U.S. oil major said it was pleased with the sale results.Exxon snapped up 69 shallow water blocks near the Texas coastline, spending $9.8 million in total. Analysts have said the company may be preparing for a carbon capture and storage project.The company on Wednesday said only that it was ""evaluating the seismic and subsurface geology for future commercial potential.""BP's high bids totaled $46.6 million, while Shell Plc spent $20.1 million and Equinor ASA's high bids amounted to $18.3 million.The leases are for five- or 10-year terms, depending on water depth, and carry royalty rates of 18.75%, a maximum established in the IRA. The rate is an increase for shallow water leases, which in recent sales were offered with a royalty rate of 12.5%. The IRA raised the minimum royalty rate for offshore leases to 16.67%.The Gulf of Mexico accounts for 15% of U.S. oil production and 1% of natural gas production, according to BOEM. Production in the region is expected to keep growing through 2027, according to a 2022 BOEM forecast.

Two of four new projects aiming for a financial okay this quarter have been pushed back, and others will face that higher bar, said analysts.The pair that have gone ahead - Venture Global LNG's project in Louisiana and Sempra Energy's in Texas - embody what analysts say have met the new requirements: less reliance on developer's equity and more on fully contracted capacity.Both projects won approvals with strong corporate financing - $7.8 billion for Venture Global and $6.8 billion for Sempra - noted Jefferies Group Managing Director of Equities Research Lloyd Byrne.And the pair address volatile gas-price risk by having about 90% of production capacity under long-term deals, Byrne wrote in a report this week. Rivals who are unable to recruit a full contingent of buyers face ""a project stalling or outright cancellation,"" he added.NEW DELAYSEleni Papadopoulou, lead natural gas analyst at commodity data and analytics firm Kpler, said the banking crisis that emerged earlier this month raised ""concerns that banking lending activity might be pulled back,"" she said, and ""delay further FIDs,"" using the acronym for financial investment decision approvals.The proposed NextDecade and Energy Transfer LP export terminals - the two other projects previously aiming for FID in the first quarter - have been repeatedly delayed due to rising construction, labor and borrowing costs, and by the recently narrowing spread between U.S. and global natural gas prices.Story continuesEnergy Transfer pointed to February comments by its co-CEO Thomas Long that it was optimistic its LNG project would go ahead.On Tuesday, French bank Societe Generale SA confirmed it last year had withdrawn as lead bank for NextDecade's Rio Grande LNG project.NextDecade said it had taken on MUFG Bank as a financial advisor last year and retained Macquarie Capital as a second advisor.'HARDER SELL'This month, NextDecade said it aimed for a financial go-ahead for the first phase of Rio Grande before the end of next quarter. Two months earlier it said it expected the decision by March 30.Soaring inflation means ""LNG exporters need to recover their costs via higher liquefaction fees, which is a harder sell now with gas prices collapsing,"" said Stephen Ellis, an energy strategist at Morningstar Research Services LLC.Demand for U.S. LNG increased after several countries slowed purchases of Russian energy and imposed sanctions on Moscow after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.After hitting record highs of around $90 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in Europe and $70 in Asia last summer, gas prices this year plunged to around $13 in Europe and Asia. U.S. gas prices dropped from a high near $10 last summer to $2 today.""Developers have re-evaluated their cost structure and profitability and that, I think, is what is delaying some of these final investment decisions,"" said Ade Allen, an analyst at energy consulting firm Rystad Energy.(Reporting by Scott DiSavino; editing by Gary McWilliams and Chizu Nomiyama)]"

It has four other sponsors in the Senate and five in the House, all Democrats.""Much like we should be requiring universal background checks before selling weapons of war domestically, we should be prioritizing a government’s human rights record before providing them access to our arms and defense services,"" Menendez said in a statement.The CAT policy covers review of security assistance, government-to-government weapons transfers and licensed commercial sales of U.S.-origin military equipment and services overseen by the State Department as well as the Defense Department and Department of Commerce, including firearms commonly available in the United States.Defense companies and activists scrutinize such policies for insight into the administration's posture as it balances commercial interests of exporters like Lockheed Martin Co and Raytheon Technologies against the country's stated commitment to human rights.Under U.S. law, the chair and ranking member of the Foreign Relations and Foreign Affairs committees review major weapons transfers. They often take human rights into account and at times seek to delay or block planned sales.For example, Menendez opposes the sale of Lockheed Martin F-16 aircraft to Turkey for reasons including its record on human rights.

(NYSE:NRG) was covered in the 2019 letter with VST. We sold the shares as COVID induced volatility presented better risk/reward opportunities, but never subsequently repurchased shares—as we did with VST. Not only do we think VST is a better value, but the management team at NRG appears to have gone astray. Despite coming to his position during an activist campaign by Elliott Management in 2017, when the prior empire-building CEO was shown the door, the replacement CEO has seemingly embarked on the same failed strategy. In early December they announced the purchase of Vivint Smart Home, a smart home platform company, for $2.8 billion. The transaction diversifies NRG’s business, increases leverage, dramatically reduces intermediate-term shareholder capital returns, and most importantly, is the opposite of what management told us they were going to do when they assumed the role in 2017. The stock fell 15% on the day of the announcement and is down another 5% since then, and now 10% lower than when we first wrote about it. We like the generation business at NRG and the valuation is almost back to interesting, but we’d probably have to see turnover in the C-suite and a refreshed corporate strategy to reignite our enthusiasm.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Utility Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:11 Best Communication Stocks to Buy10 Best Used Car Stocks to Buy15 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure: None. 16 Best Utility Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

And not anything just sort of disrupts some of the upward movement that we're watching for here on the major averages. So if you take a look here, you've got the Dow and the S&amp;P trading higher.The NASDAQ hasn't quite opened up yet because there are a lot more components in the NASDAQ composite than the S&amp;P and the Dow. Takes it a little bit longer, on occasion, to get that opening level for that index. And there it is. It's up about 1.2%. So we're seeing more strength on the tech side.Also interesting, again, to refer to our comments with Anastasia and our conversation. Tech is something that she likes right now. She's talking about a barbell strategy, with tech on the one hand and some more defensives on the other. So it seems like she's not the only one with that idea. We've talked with some other investors as of late who are starting to look at technology here.So Brad, interesting to see that movement continue.BRAD SMITH: I love a good barbell strategy.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.BRAD SMITH: Let's take a look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average, up over the past three days. So this week, as we scratch hump day here and begin the trading session, we're about one minute into the activity, Dow Jones Industrial average up 7/10 of a percent, NASDAQ composite, as you mentioned, Julie, up by a little more than 1.2% right now out of the gate. And then the S&amp;P 500, you're seeing that up by nearly a percent on the morning here.Let's also take a look at some of the sectors within the S&amp;P 500. 11 sectors, we've got them loaded up here on the screen for you, folks. We've got some green across all of those 11 sectors. As of right now, the leader on the day-- yep, just stay right there for a second. XLRE, you're seeing that hold onto gains and move higher, leading the S&amp;P 500 11 sectors. And that's up by about 1 and 1/2 percent.Story continuesXLK, technology, also doing good on the day. That's up by about 1.3% out of the gate. Let's take a look at technology, speaking of this, with the heavily weighted NASDAQ 100 on the technology front, as you're seeing some of the biggest gainers there. Lulu, that'll really set up our conversation on the other side of the break, shares up higher as we kick off today's trading activity by about 13%.And then taking a look at some of the Dow components as well, the Dow 30, really just one laggard right now, and that's Merck. Merck is down by about 2/10 of a percent. We'll dig a little bit more into that later on. But Intel actually leading the charge on the Dow Jones Industrial Average right now. So largely sea of green there, 29 out of 30. That's not too shabby.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, very interesting. I guess Micron not hurting matters when it comes to Intel and some of the other tech.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: DCP Midstream LP DCP, The Williams Companies Inc. WMB and MPLX LP MPLX.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:3 Midstream Stocks to Watch in a Volatile Energy MarketAmong the macro factors impacting the broader energy sector, the banking crisis has been rekindling fear of recession and spurring market volatility.Companies belonging to the sector have been witnessing a choppy business environment since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020.However, with the rapid developments of vaccines, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Currently, WTI oil price is trading at more than $70 per barrel.Considering the backdrop, it would be wise for investors to bet on midstream stocks like DCP Midstream LP, The Williams Companies Inc. and MPLX LP.Midstream Energy Players to the RescueAlthough the fate of energy players is highly dependent on oil and gas prices, stocks in midstream space have lower exposure to volatility in commodity prices. This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term. Thus, their business model is relatively low-risk that indicates considerably less exposure to oil and gas prices and volume risks.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three stocks belonging to the midstream energy space that are well poised to gain and hence investors should keep an eye on these stocks. All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continues3 Stocks in the SpotlightDCP Midstream LP: DCP Midstream is a leading provider of midstream services, having a fully integrated and resilient business model. With 12 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage assets, the master limited partnership has 2.8 billion cubic feet of daily natural gas pipeline capacity. DCP Midstream strongly focuses on strengthening its balance sheet with the foremost priority of reducing debt load.MPLX LP: MPLX has ownership and operating interests in midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets, thereby generating stable cashflow. With a strong focus on returning capital to unit holders, MPLX repurchased $491 million of common units last year. Under its unit repurchase authorization, the partnership has yet to repurchase the remaining $846 million of its units.The Williams Companies Inc: The Williams Companies is well-poised to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy since it is engaged in transporting, storing, gathering and processing natural gas and natural gas liquids.With its pipeline networks spread across more than 30,000 miles, The Williams Companies connects premium basins in the United States to the key market. WMB’s assets can meet 30% of the nation’s consumption of natural gas, which is utilized for heating purposes and clean-energy generation.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

On Wednesday, it declined comment.Industry sources had said the breakdown was a test of two competing views on the speed of the post-COVID recovery, with Boeing gaining confidence from renewed sales of the MAX following a safety crisis and Ryanair prepared to wait it out.O'Leary told the Financial Times last week that talks had resumed. On Wednesday, O'Leary said the breakthrough came after Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun and Stan Deal, head of its commercial division, approached Ryanair two months ago.Story continues""They are back talking to us; I think it takes maybe six, nine months to get a deal done,"" he added.The Ryanair CEO voiced support for Calhoun and said he hoped Boeing's management would stabilise ""over a number of years"", adding the company had been through a rough period of delays.""I think Calhoun is putting together a good team and we would like to see that team stabilise over a number of years, and we could get back to kind of normal for doing business relations,"" he said.(This story has been corrected to say 'Federal Aviation Administration', not 'Federal Aviation Authority', in paragraph 6)(Reporting by Tim Hepher, Joanna Plucinska; Editing by Jan Harvey, Mark Potter and Josie Kao)]"

But across the board there are plenty of stocks that underperform the market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) share price is up 57% in the last three years, that falls short of the market return. In the last year the stock has gained 5.2%.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Boeing Because Boeing made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. When a company doesn't make profits, we'd generally expect to see good revenue growth. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth.Boeing actually saw its revenue drop by 3.9% per year over three years. The modest share price gain of 16% per year suggests holders are sanguine about the falling revenue. Profit focussed investors would generally avoid a company with falling revenue and zero profits, since it's hard to imagine when profit might come.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Boeing will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Boeing has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 5.2% in the last twelve months. Notably the five-year annualised TSR loss of 6% per year compares very unfavourably with the recent share price performance. We generally put more weight on the long term performance over the short term, but the recent improvement could hint at a (positive) inflection point within the business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Boeing better, we need to consider many other factors.

115,e2271083-ca78-3b22-b681-8776f955df83,BA,2023-03-30,Investors Heavily Search The Boeing Company (BA): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-boeing-company-130001356.html,1680094801,STORY,['BA'],"[Boeing (BA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this airplane builder have returned +1.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.3% change. The Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, to which Boeing belongs, has lost 1.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Boeing is expected to post a loss of $0.73 per share, indicating a change of +73.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -21.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.28 points to a change of +102.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -50.9%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.87 indicates a change of +1,999% from what Boeing is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Boeing.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for BA _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Boeing, the consensus sales estimate of $17.89 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +27.9%. The $81.35 billion and $89.84 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +22.1% and +10.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryBoeing reported revenues of $19.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +35.1%. EPS of -$1.75 for the same period compares with -$7.69 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.85%. The EPS surprise was -3600%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Boeing is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Boeing. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Market worries about stress in the banking system have eased following a U.S. regulator-backed sale of failed lender Silicon Valley Bank's assets as well as lack of fresh signs of trouble in the sector since the buyout deal.Regional U.S. bank stocks were mixed, with Truist Financial Corp and Western Alliance Bancorp up 1% and 0.6%, respectively, in premarket trade, while First Republic Bank fell 1.3%.Larger peers Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co rose between 0.7% and 1%.A slight retreat in Treasury yields, which had rebounded over the past two sessions, lifted major technology and growth stocks, with Microsoft Corp, Alphabet and Meta Platforms up between 0.8% and 1.4%.""Markets are calmer as the tension of the banking situation is lessening. The fact that yields are a bit lower this morning is likely to induce stock markets to move higher,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.The banking turmoil, which started earlier in March with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, has led markets to reprice expectations of future monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve.Traders' bets are tilted towards no rate hike by the Fed in May, with odds of a 25-basis-point increase at 39%, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool.""We'll (likely) see the Fed ending its campaign at the May meeting and the reason for that is because recession is not far away,"" Cardillo said.Story continuesMichael Barr, the Fed's vice chairman for supervision, will testify before Congress for a second day after he criticized SVB's risk management on Tuesday.Investors will also monitor a report on pending home sales later in the day, while a key inflation reading expected at the end of the week will provide more clues on the Fed's monetary tightening plans.The CBOE volatility index, known as Wall Street's fear gauge, fell to its lowest since March 9, reflecting easing investor anxiety.At 8:15 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 216 points, or 0.66%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis were up 32.5 points, or 0.81%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 114.25 points, or 0.9%.Among major stock moves, Micron Technology Inc advanced 3.5% after the chipmaker forecast a boost to sales in 2025 from artificial intelligence.U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd slipped nearly 1% before the bell, a day after touching a more than one-month high on the internet giant's revamp and listing plans.Lululemon Athletica Inc jumped 16.6% after forecasting annual sales and profit above estimates, while Lucid Group Inc gained 2.0% on plans to lay off about 18% of its workforce.Boeing Co rose 1.1% after the chief executive of Ryanair Holdings said the company had resumed talks with the U.S. planemaker for 100 new aircraft.

ILMN recently announced the launch of Connected Insights -- a new cloud-based software that enables tertiary analysis for clinical next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Connected Insights is commercially available in a limited number of countries and is undergoing beta testing in the United States.The recent launch will expand Illumina’s portfolio of oncology testing.More on Illumina Connected SoftwareIllumina Connected Software is an end-to-end software system that standardizes analysis tools and connects data across the genomics workflow. The software is intended to streamline interpretation and reporting from a range of assay types, allowing labs to scale the use of NGS and reduce the turnaround time of clinical reporting.The software’s initial release will support somatic oncology applications, matching the growing use of comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) for advanced tumors. The software will also include whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for rare diseases soon.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, Connected Insights enables labs to connect to a network of more than 45 third-party knowledge sources that provide digital directories for precision oncology, illustrating connections between cancer variants and therapies, citing evidence, and aiding analysis of complex cancer genomic profiles.Benefits of the Connected SoftwareWith the increasing demand for NGS testing in health care systems, the need for interpretation of large genomic data sets with complex health implications in a landscape of frequently changing guidelines and drug approvals has become critical. Per management, Connected Insights complements Illumina’s suite of NGS solutions to generate, analyze, annotate, and interpret data consistently today and into the future.Connected Insights is the subsequent step in creating a fully-integrated software ecosystem that scales with the pace of discovery across NGS applications. Building on Illumina’s platforms of proven SBS technology with DRAGEN secondary analysis, Illumina Connected Insight allows its users to bring a variety of knowledgebases and data together to discover clinical relevance.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global next-generation sequencing market size was estimated at $4.84 billion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 12.4%. Factors such as extensive adoption of NGS technologies in clinical diagnostics due to rapid result time and faster processing and rowing technological developments in NGS instruments and technologies are fuelling the market.Strong Growth in Oncology SpaceIn 2022, Illumina’s oncology testing consumables grew 7% year-over-year from the utilization of MGS-based molecular profiling across early detection, therapy selection and minimal residual disease. The company witnessed increasing opportunities for its oncology products globally. For the TruSight Oncology 500 distributed therapy selection assay, sample volume grew about 60% year over year across more than 500 accounts. For 2023, the company expects more than $100 million in revenue for TSO 500.The company is witnessing stronger-than-expected clinical adoption and orders from new to high-throughput customers who are bringing sequencing in-house due to NovaSeq X's ease of use and cost benefits. The NovaSeq X has had the strongest pre-order book of any Illumina instrument launch, and this demand will catalyze a multiyear upgrade cycle.In oncology, GRAIL continues to have strong demand from consumers, physicians, health systems and payers. Galleri is the only multi-cancer early-detection test in a $40-plus billion market, and it had the fastest first-year revenue ramp in cancer screening test history. In 2022, more than 4,500 providers ordered the test, contributing to the more than 60,000 Galleri test orders that have been received to date. GRAIL expects this exciting momentum to continue and to translate into an expected revenue CAGR of 60% to 90% over the next five years.Share PriceIn the past year, Illumina has outperformed its industry. The stock has dipped 15.9% against a 39.3% decline of the industry.Zacks Rank and Key PicksIllumina carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

We recognize our obligations to:Reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through both internal efforts and partnerships with customers, communities and other industries. Our goal of net zero by 2050 includes direct Scope 1 emissions across our electric and gas businesses. We are also committed to reducing our Scope 2 emissions and working with partners and customers to reduce Scope 3 upstream and downstream emissions.Support a Just Transition for our employees and communities as we decarbonize our energy portfolio.Continuously improve energy efficiency through technological advancements and innovative programming across our service territories.Meet or surpass all environmental laws and regulations - compliance is the foundation of our environmental commitment.Practice conservation, promote biodiversity on our land and in the communities we serve.Learn moreAmong Industry Leaders in Emissions ReportingSouthern Company reports all relevant Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions through its annual CDP submission and other company disclosures. Notably, we received limited assurance from Deloitte &amp; Touche, LLP for our 2021 and 2020 Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions, and we continued to expand our Scope 3 emissions reporting in 2022. Our enhanced reporting is responsive to feedback received through Southern Company's robust stakeholder engagement efforts.Spotlight: GHG Emissions ReductionsSouthern Company's net zero strategy considers both direct and indirect emissions reductions. Drivers for direct emissions reduction include: reduced reliance on coal-fired generating assets, use of natural gas to enable the low-carbon energy transition, further growth in our portfolio of zero-carbon resources, enhanced energy efficiency initiatives, negative carbon solutions and continued investment in research and development (R&amp;D) of clean energy technologies. While our net zero goal is focused on direct emissions, we are also committed to reducing emissions across our full value chain through engagement, energy efficiency measures and partnerships with customers, suppliers and other organizations.Story continuesAs we transition to net zero, we believe having a diversified energy portfolio is crucial to reducing emissions while maintaining reliability and affordability for our customers. Since 2007, we have significantly reduced our reliance on coal-fired generation, meaningfully increased generation from zero-carbon resources and made strategic decisions around our use of natural gas.Southern Company continues to reduce the number of generating units in our coal fleet, lowering emissions and retiring uneconomic resources.

122,ed47e4a8-7f04-371d-8f29-fc1b6e94bc77,MAA,2023-03-30,3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks: A Smarter Way to Boost Your Retirement Income,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-ranked-dividend-stocks-131001315.html,1680095401,STORY,"['RF', 'MAA']","[Here's a revealing data point: older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself.Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.In today's economic environment, traditional income investments are not working.In the past, investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady, reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6.50%, whereas the current rate is much lower.The effect of this drop in rates is substantial: over 20 years, the change in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is over $1 million.And lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.Unfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?Invest in Dividend StocksWe feel that these dividend-paying equities - as long as they are from high-quality, low-risk issuers - can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low-yielding Treasury bonds (or other bonds).Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesOne approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3% and positive average annual dividend growth. Numerous stocks hike dividends over time, counterbalancing inflation risks.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.4 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.9%. This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield of 3.96% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.8%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 21.95%. Check Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Plymouth Industrial (PLYM) is paying out a dividend of $0.23 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 4.43% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.9% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 4.76% over the past year. Check Plymouth Industrial (PLYM) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.2 per share, Regions Financial (RF) has a dividend yield of 4.37%. This is compared to the Banks - Southeast industry's yield of 2.44% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 17.65%. Check Regions Financial (RF) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Yes, that's true. As a broad category, bonds carry less risk than stocks. However, the stocks we are talking about - dividend -paying stocks from high-quality companies - can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole.A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies, especially blue chip stocks, increase their dividends over time, helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks, you can still pursue a dividend income strategy. However, it's important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF, which can ultimately reduce your dividend income, working against your strategy. Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest.Bottom LineWhether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, seeking the steady income of dividend-paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress-free retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A solid 2023 guidance also acts as an additional tailwind for the stock.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceCigna carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.The stock has gained 4.4% in a year against the industry’s 6.4% decline. The Medical sector and the S&amp;P Index have declined 17.6% and 14.6%, respectively, in the same time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFavorable Style ScoreCI is well-poised for progress, as evidenced by its impressive VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of all three factors.Robust Growth ProspectsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CI’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.77 per share, indicating an improvement of 6.5% from the year-earlier reading, while the same for revenues stands at $187.7 billion, implying a 3.9% increase from the prior-year actual.The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $28.22 per share, suggesting 13.9% growth from the 2023 estimate. The same for revenues stands at $224.2 billion, which indicates a rise of 19.5% from the 2023 estimate.Solid Surprise HistoryCigna’s earnings outpaced estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 9.98%.Optimist Guidance for 2023This year, Cigna anticipates adjusted revenues at a minimum of $187 billion, which indicates growth of at least 3.5% from the 2022 reported figure.Adjusted earnings per share are predicted to be a minimum of $24.60, which suggests minimum growth of 5.7% from the 2022 figure.Growth DriversCigna’s performance continues to benefit from the strength exhibited by its two growth platforms, namely Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. While a solid specialty pharmacy services suite drives the growth of the Evernorth platform, the Cigna Healthcare unit benefits from an expansive customer base within its U.S. Government and U.S. Commercial businesses.Story continuesUndoubtedly, a rising customer base gives rise to growing premiums, which remains the most significant revenue component for any health insurer like Cigna. As of Dec 31, 2022, total medical customers of CI grew 5.4% year over year. An aging U.S. population is expected to sustain the solid demand for its Medicare plans, which falls under the Government business, in the days ahead.In addition to the solid inflow of premiums, the Cigna Healthcare unit benefits on the back of continuous product expansions and new collaborations or contract extensions with renowned healthcare systems.CI resorts to acquisitions in order to bolster its suite of solutions and capabilities as well as step into newer geographies and solidify its presence in existing markets. It has divested its non-health units in order to intensify its focus on its two growth platforms exhibiting solid potential. Divestitures were also a way for Cigna to bring down the mounting debt burden and its efforts have bore fruits as long-term debt witnessed a 9.7% year-over-year downfall as of Dec 31, 2022.A growing cash balance and robust cash-generating abilities will continue to empower Cigna in undertaking business growth investments and prudently deploying capital via share repurchases and dividend payments. In Feb 2023, management approved a 10% hike in the quarterly dividend. Its dividend yield of 1.9% is higher than the industry’s average of 1.2%.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Medical space are Masimo Corporation MASI, OraSure Technologies, Inc. OSUR and Elevance Health, Inc. ELV. While Masimo and OraSure Technologies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Elevance Health carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Masimo’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 9.02%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MASI’s 2023 earnings indicates a 3.5% rise, while the same for revenues suggests an improvement of 19.5% from the respective prior-year tallies. The consensus mark for MASI’s 2023 earnings has moved 8.7% north in the past 30 days.The bottom line of OraSure Technologies outpaced estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once, the average being 554.17%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for OSUR’s 2023 earnings is pegged at 39 cents per share. A loss of 25 cents per share was reported in the prior year. OSUR has witnessed three upward estimate revisions for 2023 earnings compared to no downward revision over the past 60 days. Elevance Health’s earnings outpaced estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 4.11%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ELV’s 2023 earnings indicates a 12.6% rise, while the same for revenues suggests an improvement of 5.9% from the respective prior-year tallies. The consensus mark for ELV’s 2023 earnings has moved up 0.1% in the past 30 days.The Masimo stock has gained 11.1% in a year.

124,6f25d2b0-592f-3f25-8563-3303c2c2a7d1,CI,2023-03-30,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Cigna Group (CI) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-cigna-group-130001751.html,1680094801,STORY,['CI'],"[Cigna (CI) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this health insurer have returned -12.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.3% change. The Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, to which Cigna belongs, has lost 16% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Cigna is expected to post earnings of $5.35 per share, indicating a change of -11% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.77 points to a change of +6.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.9%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.22 indicates a change of +13.9% from what Cigna is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Cigna.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CI _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Cigna, the consensus sales estimate of $45.27 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.6%. The $187.7 billion and $224.22 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.9% and +19.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCigna reported revenues of $45.74 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.2%. EPS of $4.96 for the same period compares with $4.77 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $45.58 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.37%. The EPS surprise was +2.48%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cigna is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cigna. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

127,76ae0b3a-ebc2-3e88-9ba3-d2b4e9264ea6,NKE,2023-03-30,Lululemon Seems To Be Insulated From Recession With Its Premium Yoga Wear,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lululemon-seems-insulated-recession-premium-145609441.html,1680101769,STORY,"['LULU', 'NKE']","[On Tuesday, shares of Lululemon Athletica Inc (NASDAQ: LULU) rose about 11% upon quarterly results that topped Wall Street expectations. The retailer of high-end yoga gear had quite a holiday-quarter that topped estimates on fiscal 2023 revenue and full-year profit. Unlike cautious Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE), Lululemon also issued upbeat guidance for the new fiscal year.Fourth Quarter FiguresFor the three-month period that ended on January 29th, revenue rose from last year’s $2.13 billion to $2.77 billion with net income falling from $434.5 billion, or $3.36 per share earned during last year’s comparable quarter to $119.8 million, or 94 cents per share. Putting aside impairment and other charges related to the acquisition of Mirror and other items, adjusted per share earnings amounted to $4.40. Total comparable or same-store sales that account stores that have been continuously open for at least 12 months rose 27%.OutlookLululemon expects fiscal 2023 revenue in the range between $9.3 billion and $9.41 billion, exceeding $9.14 billion that Wall Street expected, according to Refinitiv, with full-year profit expected in the range between $11.50 and $11.72 per share, also topping Refinitiv estimate of $11.26 per share.Inventory StrugglesIn December, Lululemon said inventories at the end of its third quarter were up 85% YoY to $1.7 billion while on Tuesday, it stated that as of the end of 2022, inventories were up 50% to $1.4 billion. As a comparison, during its latest reported quarter, Nike reported its inventories were up 16% compared to last year’s comparable quarter. Consequently, Lululemon’s gross margins fell 300 basis points to 55.1% while adjusted gross margin slid 70 basis points to 57.4% so both brands harmed their margins with efforts to get rid of excess inventory.Notably, Lululemon made progress liquidating excess inventory, but Morningstar analyst David Swartz told Yahoo Finance that it does look like Lululemon had to resort to more discounting to normal to get the reported sales figures, yet the Vancouver-based athletic apparel retailer does not like to talk much about discounting.Story continuesWhat Does Lululemon Have That Nike Doesn’t?Although both apparel companies do a great job at standing out from the crowd, Lululemon's attention is solely on the premium and higher end of the apparel market. In a way, Lululemon can be considered as a pioneer of the ""athleisure"" movement which allowed it to gather a customer base that even Nike failed to address fully. As people sought out more comfortable quality attire during the pandemic-induced lockdowns, Lululemon gained a significant advantage in terms of premium customers who are both willing and able to pay up for their athleisure wear merchandise and this is a great strength of Lululemon in the face of recession fears.The Lawsuit SagaAt the end of January, Nike revealed it is suing Lululemon for patent infringement related to at least four of its sneakers, stating it has suffered economic harm and irreparable injury as a result. This latest lawsuit is only a new chapter in a contentious legal history between the two companies as the Oregon-based Nike previously sued Lululemon for patent infringement over its at-home Mirror fitness device. In both cases, Lululemon finds these claims unjustified.TakeawayLululemon’s results suggest that wealthier shoppers are still purchasing yoga wear, despite inflation rising prices for essential goods. Through Tuesday’s close, Lululemon’s market value reached $40.87 billion. Although this is still not a dominant brand in the industry like Nike, Lululemon’s is not going anywhere as the Vancouver-based athletic apparel retailer believes it is one of the few companies with a long pathway for growth ahead. It seems that premium yoga wear does a great job at insulating against a recession, but Lululemon still needs to prove its brand's durability over a long period of time.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

""Mirror hardware sales during the holiday season came in below expectations.""Frank added the business is a ""very small portion"" of management's five-year plan. After factoring in Lululemon's write-down in Q4 of 2022, the business has now almost been entirely written off.CEO Calvin McDonald, who has helmed Lululemon for nearly five years (and joined Disney's board in 2021), signed off on the purchase of Mirror for $500 million in June 2020 at a point in the COVID-19 pandemic when valuations for at-home fitness equipment like Pelotons and Tonals were skyrocketing.As the waning pandemic led to a cooling of the home fitness market, Lululemon unsuccessfully attempted to integrate the Mirror acquisition operationally, culturally, and from a sales perspective. Mirror Founder Brynn Putnam stepped down as CEO in September 2021.The athleisure company, which also dealt with consumer backlash on the platform's lackluster user experience compared to slicker experiences such as Peloton and Tonal, tried offering discounts on the hardware. In mid-2022, Lululemon said Mirror would be included in a new all-access pass for $39 a month. For the package, dubbed Lululemon Studio, Mirror users would be rolled into a subscription that also includes workout content from Rumble, Y7, Pure Barre, and DogPound.Now Lululemon says it's considering a future of no longer producing the Mirror hardware, pretty much negating the very reason behind spending $500 million on the company.Story continuesA Mirror workout. (Lululemon)""On Mirror, I just want to clarify, we're not eliminating the hardware, but we are adding an app feature that will allow a guest to sign up and pay a lower monthly subscription fee and access the same content without having to purchase the hardware,"" McDonald said on the call, minutes after Frank noted earlier it was ""pivoting away"" from the ""hardware centric"" business model. ""So just want to clarify that. And that we'll launch later this summer.""In any case, Lululemon buying Mirror could become a case study in everything you shouldn't do when acquiring another business.""We did see an improvement in our performance with the launch of Lululemon Studio in October, but as we've shared, it just didn't meet our expectations,"" McDonald's added. ""And although CAACs are improving, they are still not proving fast enough that we felt prudent to make this pivot to open up the TAM [total addressable market] and appeal to a broader audience within our collective.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

CROX is making significant progress in expanding digital and omni-channel capabilities. The company is also benefiting from strong consumer demand. This was seen in fourth-quarter 2022, with both the top line and bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increasing year over year. The company also remains well positioned from its recent acquisition of HEYDUDE.Digital Sales: Key FactorCROX increased its focus on the Crocs mobile app and global social platforms which aided its digital sales. In the fourth quarter, the company’s digital sales advanced 80% year over year, indicating significant growth from the prior-year quarter’s figure of 41%. The metric represented 45.1% of total revenues, up from the year-ago quarter’s figure of 40.3%. This growth was driven by refined user experience, new products and marketing activities.What Else Is Driving GrowthThe company recently added HEYDUDE to its portfolio of brands. Crocs hopes to boost the value of its quickly expanding footwear business with this acquisition. This is the second highly profitable, high-growth brand that Crocs has added to its portfolio. The acquisition is probably going to increase Crocs' online brand penetration and diversify its portfolio of brands.Notably, the HEYDUDE brand’s fourth-quarter revenues advanced 36.6% year over year to $279 million. For 2023, revenues related to the HEYDUDE buyout are likely to grow in mid-20% range on a reported basis. Management remains optimistic about the HEYDUDE brand and expects the brand to attain $1 billion in revenues in 2023.Crocs sandal business is also aiding the company’s growth.

131,256a7adb-9b6a-31a7-bfd2-d6ccae9c8820,VFC,2023-03-30,Here is What to Know Beyond Why V.F. Corporation (VFC) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-v-f-130001697.html,1680094801,STORY,['VFC'],"[V.F. (VFC) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this maker of brands such as Vans, North Face and Timberland have returned -14.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Textile - Apparel industry, which V.F. falls in, has lost 1.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.V.F. is expected to post earnings of $0.14 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -68.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9%.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.08 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -34.6%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.20 indicates a change of +5.5% from what V.F. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for V.F.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VFC _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of V.F. the consensus sales estimate of $2.75 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -2.7%. The $11.62 billion and $12.04 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -1.9% and +3.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryV.F. reported revenues of $3.53 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.6%. EPS of $1.12 for the same period compares with $1.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.49 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.14%. The EPS surprise was +13.13%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.V.F. is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about V.F. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Stocks to Buy on Robinhood for Beginners.The retail investor activity that gained pace after the pandemic continues to lose gas amid the volatile macroeconomic situation. Retail investors who used platforms like Reddit and initiated trades on Robinhood suffered bruising losses after meme stocks started falling. This has caused a massive retreat of beginner investors from retail investing platforms. According to Vanda Research, in January 2023, trading activity of retail investors hit its lowest levels since January 2020. According to Wall Street Journal, data from Vanda Research says that average portfolio of the individual investors has fallen by 27% since touching peaks in December 2021. During the same period the S&amp;P 500 index fell about 13%.Retail Investors RetreatAccording to data from Goldman Sachs, households are expected to pull a whopping $100 billion from the market this year. This would mark the first net outflow since 2018. Goldman Sachs noted that individual retail investors remain the biggest holders of US equities, and their exit from the market will pull support for major US companies, which are already suffering amid major stock declines.The retreat of the individual investors from the market is evident from the declining number of visitors on stock trading platforms, the most important of which is Robinhood. Last month, Robinhood reported weak data for monthly active users for the sixth-straight quarter. The company said its monthly active users in February came in at 12 million, unchanged from the previous month.The FOMO RallyWhen the US stock market started to post huge gains earlier this year without any solid catalysts, some investors to quick to call it a bear market rally. In January, retail trading orders for stocks and ETFs accounted for a whopping 23% of the market’s total volume in late January. This was even more than the levels reached during the 2021 meme stock frenzy.Story continuesAccording to a Bloomberg report in February, Kim Forrest, founder and chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, said that the rally was based on FOMO (fear of missing out).“People are just piling in going, ‘Crap, I missed it. I thought it was going to go down another 15%.’ We were overly pessimistic,” Forrest said at the time.George Catrambone, head of Americas Trading at DWS, also reportedly said that investors should keep in mind that the “Fed is still hiking rates.”“The danger here is that equities get too far out in front of earnings multiples and aren’t supportive of levels higher than here.”Best Stocks to Buy on Robinhood for BeginnersPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashThese analysts was right. As subsequent data showed that inflation in the US is far from over and the Federal Reserve made clear that it plans to keep raising interest rates, the stocks started to fall again.

If you want to see more best affordable tech stocks to buy now, go directly to 5 Best Affordable Tech Stocks to Buy Now.If a stock is priced at $100 per share or even $200 a share, more investors would be able to afford it than if it were priced at $1000 per share.Nevertheless affordability is only one minor factor of a stock as most of the capital in the markets are held by institutions or wealthy individuals where the price of a stock doesn't really matter. As such, the price of the stock isn't as big of a factor as it may have been in the past.Instead, the quality of a company's business, its competitive advantages, and its future earnings growth potential matters far more to a stock price.Buying blue chips with growth potential and competitive advantages is often times better than buying an average stock in the long term as blue chips are generally well known and established companies that are profitable.In terms of growth, some leading technology blue chip stocks have potential future growth potential.Many investors think that artificial intelligence will be the fourth industrial revolution and one that will allow the world to produce substantially more products and services as well as innovative products. Goldman Sachs recently estimated that generative AI could eventually help increase annual global GDP by 7% by increasing productivity. In the future, more advanced AI could help economic growth even further.For those of you interested, check out 10 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy.In the new AI and tech landscape where things can change fairly quickly, the future is uncertain. Although no one knows for sure which companies will succeed and which ones won't, the big tech companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the United States that have invested a lot into AI have some advantages. Because it takes a lot of computer processing, existing big tech companies with substantial computer processing capability, data, and financial resources have a advantage in terms of future growth. Some other leading tech companies such as The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) can also play a role in the future with their own niches with licensing for instance.Story continuesBecause AI is so fast changing, some leading tech companies could be left behind if they don't innovate enough even though they are dominating now. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Analysis, finances, workPhoto by Carlos Muza on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 14 Best Affordable Tech Stocks to Buy Now, we chose 14 tech stocks with competitive advantages that trade for around $200 or under.We then ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q4.14 Best Affordable Tech Stocks to Buy Now14.

Furthermore, the company offers leading HR technology and a wide range of services to help small and midsized businesses. Given stronger demand for the company's services, Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)'s stock has more than tripled from the beginning of 2013 and shares could potentially go higher in the long term if the payroll market continues to expand and the company maintains its market share.10.

To skip the detailed analysis of the SaaS market, go directly to the 5 Biggest SaaS Companies in the World.SaaS refers to a software delivery and licensing method in which software is accessed online via a subscription rather than being bought and installed on individual computers. In our previous report, we stated that the SaaS industry was worth $96 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $235 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 15.9%. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM) are among the top performers in the industry.A key driver of SaaS market growth is the rise of remote work. During the pandemic, nearly 70% of full-time employees worked from home. The new dynamics forced many companies to consider switching to remote work as organizational policy. In fact, an Upwork analysis established that over 60% of the companies surveyed were planning more remote work in the years after the pandemic. As more people work remotely, the demand for SaaS services expands because businesses will need to migrate most of their operations to the cloud.In addition, the SaaS market has plenty of growth opportunities. For example, Gartner predicted in 2020 that 70% of customer interactions would involve SaaS-related technologies like machine learning (ML) applications and chatbots, up from 15% in 2018. This means the AI-powered customer service niche has plenty of room for growth. Other SaaS niches with room for growth are predictive analytics, personalized marketing, cybersecurity, and data management.The SaaS market has several segmentations, each focused on a specific application of the ""as a service"" business model. One of the most popular segments is customer relationship management (CRM). The CRM segment is one of the largest in the SaaS market, with a projected market size of over $60 billion by 2025. It is also one of the fastest-growing segments; Grand View Research projects a CAGR of 14.0% between 2019 and 2025.Story continuesThe human resources (HR) software market is another significant segment of the SaaS market. It is also fast-growing, with a projected market size of over $30 billion by 2028, and it should expand at a 10.10% CAGR from 2021 to 2028. Other segments of the SaaS market include accounting and finance, collaboration and communication, and enterprise resource planning (ERP).15 Biggest SaaS Companies in the WorldPhoto by Hack Capital on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe researched the software services and Cloud industry and picked the biggest SaaS companies in the world based on market cap. The list is ranked in ascending order of market caps as of March 14.15 Biggest SaaS Companies in the World15. Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY)Market capitalization as of March 14: $47.52 billionWorkday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY) is an SaaS company because it delivers its software application over the internet, and customers can access and utilize the software without having to manage the infrastructure or deploy the software on their own. Workday provides enterprise-level cloud-based software solutions for human resources, finance, and business planning. Workday has a large customer base of over 55 million, and they provide services to more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies. In 2022, the company generated revenue of $5.14 billion.14. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP)Market capitalization as of March 14: $55.61 billionShopify is an SaaS company that provides an e-commerce platform for online stores and retail point-of-sale systems. As an SaaS company, Shopify delivers its software application over the internet, and customers can access and use the software without having to manage the infrastructure or deploy the software on their own.Shopify had over 2 million merchants using their platform to create and host online stores in 2022. The number of live websites built using Shopify is twice the number of merchants, indicating that each merchant creates an average of two unique Shopify websites. Several well-known brands, including Pepsi, Tesla, Nestle, and Staples, have Shopify websites, in addition to GymShark, Heinz, Lord &amp; Taylor, and Crate &amp; Barrel.Baron Funds mentioned Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:""Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is a cloud-based software provider for multi-channel commerce. Shares rose 28.6% in the fourth quarter, reversing some of the declines from earlier in the year, as preliminary holiday results suggested a rebound in e-commerce activity. The company also reported solid third quarter financial results showing an increase in take rates, which points to a deeper adoption of its platform by merchants. We remain shareholders due to Shopify's strong competitive positioning, innovative culture, and long runway for growth (it has less than 2% share of global commerce spending).""13. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW)Market capitalization as of March 14: $55.82 billionPalo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) primarily provides advanced security solutions to protect networks, devices, and cloud-based applications against cyber threats. As an SaaS business, the company offers several solutions that provide advanced cybersecurity protection for networks, cloud-based applications, and endpoints. They include: Prisma Access, Prisma Cloud, Cortex XDR, WildFire, and GlobalProtect.In its Q4 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments highlighted a few stocks, and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Stock selection within the IT sector was the main detractor from relative performance during the period. In addition to rate hikes compressing the multiples of longer duration, high growth companies, recession concerns were also a headwind. IT companies which had proven resilient against customer budget reductions earlier in the year are starting to feel the impact of spending slowdowns as companies further scrutinize expenses in light of economic uncertainty. For example, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), which provides enterprise security solutions including next-generation firewalls and threat detection software, faced a challenging environment as customers delayed purchases and orders. However, we remain convinced of the company’s long-term growth prospects as an industry leader in a critical field and as digital attacks and ransomware continue to grow.”12. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Market capitalization as of March 14: $85.91 billionServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is primarily an IT solutions company. The company has offerings in several categories of the IT industry.

In the latest financial results, the company revealed that total revenues grew 22% year-over-year to $1.94 billion. For the full year 2022, the revenue growth was 28% year-over-year. Following the strong financial performance, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg raised his price target on ServiceNow, Inc.

(NYSE:NOW) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an $80 billion market cap business based in California. Its purpose is to make the world of work, work better for people. Getting a job done in an enterprise (what the company refers to as “workflow”) usually requires different people in various functions of an organization to work together. Often, they rely on different technology systems and inefficient manual processes to complete each step of the job before moving on to the next.ServiceNow believes the most effective digital transformation initiative utilizes tools that can integrate workflows across siloed systems, departments, processes, and people. The company is solving what is arguably the biggest pain point in the biggest profit pool in the world (enterprises). Consider the explosion in data growth and all the software point solutions emerging constantly. ServiceNow wrangles all this into a fully integrated dashboard on a global scale with global customers in every industry. Nearly 100% of revenues are subscription based with a 99% renewal rate, and the company currently has no direct competition, according to our research. ServiceNow started with an IT workflow, and today, ~40% of net new annual contract value is in non-IT workflows. Through constant innovation, the business has continued to expand its total addressable market, and we think it can grow free cash flow (FCF) at a 20%+ annualized rate for the next three to five years.

Inc. (NYSE:MKC) had endured a very difficult year, with the stock losing almost 27%. The double whammy of inflationary pressures and currency exchange had weighed on the companys results for some time. Smaller impacts from McCormicks exit of its Russian business and Covid-19-related disruptions in China also impacted results.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with MKC. Click here to check it out. MKC 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MKCPeter Lynch Chart of MKCBut after releasing earnings, the stock surged almost 10% in Tuesday's trading session, placing the stocks one-year performance almost in line with the decline in the S&amp;P 500 over this period of time.McCormick Roars After EarningsDespite the gain in a single trading day, McCormick appears to be undervalued. Lets dig deeper to see why I believe investors can still expect upside going forward.Earnings highlightsMcCormick reported first-quarter results on March 28. Revenue improved almost 3% to $1.57 billion, topping analysts estimates by $20.5 million. Adjusted earnings per share of 59 cents compared unfavorably to 63 cents in the prior year, but was 9 cents above expectations.Adjusting for currency exchange, net sales were up 5% year over year. Higher realized prices added 10.6% to results, which were partially offset by a 2% decline in volume and a 3% headwind from product mix.The Consumer business fell 1.8% as volume and mix declines and divestures more than offset a nearly 9% contribution from pricing activities. By region, this segment had a 3.3% increase in the Americas, an 8.8% decrease in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and a decline of more than 15% in Asia-Pacific.Flavor Solutions improved 10%, driven by a 13.5% increase in pricing, which was only partially offset by a small decrease in volume and mix. The Americas and Europe, the Middle East and Africa grew 12.7% and 6.8%, respectively, while Asia-Pacific fell just 1.1%.Story continuesHigher costs due to demand and supply chain issues did hamper margins slightly, as the gross margin contracted 80 basis points to 36%. That impact was felt most in the Flavor Solutions business as the company needed to spend in order to meet an increase in customer demand. This can be seen as a positive given where this business was during and shortly after the pandemic. Demand from customers has more than returned to pre-Covid levels, requiring additional materials and employees.However, cost controls meant that selling, general and adminstrative expenses actually declined 40 basis points to 21.5%. Also aiding margins was the divesture of lower-margin businesses.McCormick provided guidance for the year as well, with the company expecting adjusted earnings per share of $2.56 to $2.61 for 2023. For context, the company had $2.53 of adjusted earnings per share in 2022. Net sales are forecasted to improve 5% to 7%, ahead of consensus of 5.3%.TakeawaysMcCormick has almost been a tale of two companies over the past few years. The Consumer business reaped the benefit of customers being forced to prepare more meals at home during the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic. The growth rates seen during this period were often in the low-to-mid-double-digit range and as high as 35% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, reflecting the increased number of meals cooked at home.Juxtaposed to this is the Flavor Solutions business, which supplies products to the food service industry. This business struggled mightily during the pandemic with the closing of so many restaurants due to social distancing restrictions. The segments worst performance came during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, where the business fell nearly 19% from the prior year. Now this segment is returning to growth over the past few periods even as lockdowns in China had previously been a headwind.With much of the world seeing a normalization to a pre-Covid-19 environment, the Consumer business has been more inconsistent. Some declines in the business should have been expected given the unprecedented demand for products.The surprising part of this is the declines are not exactly massive or even present compared to periods of high growth. Year-over-year growth rates following the first quarter of 2021 never got worse than a decrease of 8.4%.More recently, Consumer had seen decreases of 7.6%, an increase of 9.8%, an improvement of 0.7% and a decline of 8.4% in the four quarters of fiscal 2022.The Flavor Solutions business' results show customers are eating out much more than they had been doing, but this has not translated to an exact corresponding decrease in the Consumer business.McCormick is essentially getting the best of both worlds as Consumer segment sales remain at or above their best levels during the worst of the pandemic, while the Flavor Solutions business remains in high-growth mode.Valuation analysisMcCormicks guidance came in higher than what analysts had anticipated, which, combined with the earnings and revenue beat, caused the stock to jump almost 10% in one day.Using the midpoint of company guidance, McCormick is trading at more than 31 times forward earnings. This is not too far off the five-year average multiple of around 30 times earnings.Looking at the GF Value chart, it appears that shares still have more upside potential based on its historical ratios, past financial performance and analysts' future earnings projections.McCormick Roars After EarningsCurrently, McCormicks GF Value is $97.65, giving the stock a price-to-GF Value ratio of 0.83. Reaching the GF Value would result in a further return of more than 20%, which is before factoring in the companys small but market-beating yield of 1.9%. McCormick earns a rating of modestly undervalued from GuruFocus.Further bolstering my bullish thesis on the stock is that McCormick has a GF Score of 91 out of 100. Stocks with higher GF Scores often outperform those with lower scores according to GuruFocus research. McCormick receives top marks on growth, profitability and value and low scores on momentum and financial strength.McCormick Roars After EarningsFinal thoughtsAfter a very difficult year for the stock, shareholders enjoyed a strong rally on Tuesday. This was due to solid results in the business and guidance that was ahead of forecasts.The Consumer business continues to oscillate between periods of growth and decline, but has retained many of the customers that it gained during 2020. Flavor Solutions continues to produce robust growth as pricing action has not had a severe negative consequence on demand. In fact, the company had to spend more to meet demand in the first quarter.Shares of McCormick are not cheap on a forward basis, but they rarely have been over the medium term. Investors buying even after the spike in price could still be rewarded with more than 20% returns.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

(UAL) is benefiting from its solid cargo operations as well as buoyant air-travel demand. However, low liquidity is a headwind.Factors Favoring UALOwing to buoyant air-travel demand, United Airlines posted a significant year-over-year increase (about 51.37%) in fourth-quarter 2022 revenues. The uptick was driven by a 62.9% rise in passenger revenues (accounting for 90.3% of the top line) to $11,202 million. Moreover, passenger revenues increased 12.8% from the fourth-quarter 2019 reading.Nearly 39 million passengers traveled on UAL flights in the December quarter. Driven by solid demand, management expects total revenue per available seat mile to grow in the 22-23% band year over year for the first quarter of 2023. Total revenues are anticipated to grow almost 51% year over year.United Airlines’ focus on its cargo operations is boosting cargo revenues, thus partly offsetting the weakness in passenger revenues from the 2019 levels. In 2021, the carrier’s cargo revenues jumped 42.5% year over year and 99.2% from the 2019 level. In 2022, cargo revenues increased 84.1% from the 2019 level. Cargo revenues skyrocketed 49.4% from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals to $472 million.Key RiskA decline in the current ratio (a measure of liquidity) does not bode well for the company. The carrier exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with a current ratio of 1.00, down from 1.03 in third-quarter 2022 and 1.04 in second-quarter 2022. A reduction in this key ratio generally implies that the company's ability to generate cash is on the decline.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksUnited Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

157,af9e927b-a192-3f04-8de5-eac213906081,UAL,2023-03-30,United Announces $5 Million Investment in Carbon Capture Company Svante,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-announces-5-million-investment-133000123.html,1680096600,STORY,['UAL'],"[Airline looks to turn CO2 removed from the atmosphere into sustainable aviation fuelUnited has invested in more future SAF production than any other airline in the world 1CHICAGO, March 29, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- United today announced its $5 million investment in carbon capture technology company Svante, who provides materials and technology as part of the value chain that has the potential to convert CO2 removed from the atmosphere and from industrial emission sources into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This is the latest announced investment from the new UAV Sustainable Flight FundSM, a first-of-its-kind investment vehicle that is designed to leverage support from cross-industry businesses in order to support start-ups focused on decarbonizing air travel through SAF research, technology and production.The airline aims to be 100% green by reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 100% by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets. To date, United has invested in the future production of over three billion gallons of SAF - the most of any airline in the world.1""Carbon capture technology has the potential to be a critical solution in the fight to stop climate change and has the added benefit of helping us scale the production of SAF,"" said United CEO Scott Kirby. ""And at United we're building on that approach by investing in both companies that can capture CO2 and others that can turn it into fuel. There's no question that this carbon utilization is in its infancy today, but as a leader in sustainable flying we must help build the foundation to deploy this technology of the future as expediently as possible. This is truly a global imperative, and United's investment in Svante reflects our dedication to making sustainable travel a reality.""This investment was made as part of Svante's Series E financing round and will fund and support Svante's commercial-scale filter manufacturing facility in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Svante is working with world-leading organizations around the world, including Dimensional Energy, a carbon utilization – CO2 to jet fuel – company that United Airlines Ventures invested in last year.Story continues""We are pleased to have the support of United Airlines as one of our world-class investors,"" said Claude Letourneau, Svante's President &amp; CEO. ""The airline industry has a huge opportunity to make a big impact on global decarbonization – battling climate change through the transition to sustainable aviation fuels and other innovative technologies that will help the world achieve net zero. Their investment in companies like ours will aid in accelerating the commercialization of carbon capture and removal technology.""Svante is a leader in second generation solid sorbent-based carbon capture and removal. The company's scalable, eco-friendly, and commercially available carbon capture and removal technology employs structured absorbent beds, known as filters. These filters can capture 95% of CO2 emissions from industrial sites as well as CO2 that's already in the air. Once the CO2 is captured, it is concentrated and can be used in the creation of SAF or other products. It can also be safely transported and stored underground.Svante's manufacturing facility is anticipated to produce enough filter modules to capture millions of tons of carbon dioxide per year across hundreds of large-scale carbon capture facilities.""It's great to see United's commitment to building an ecosystem for carbon dioxide (CO2) to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) manifest through this significant investment in Svante,"" said Jason Salfi, Dimensional Energy's CEO. ""The teams at Svante and Dimensional Energy are working together to design integrated systems for captured CO2 to SAF today. There is enough CO2 in the atmosphere and in industrial process emissions to provide all of the carbon necessary for the fuels and products people use every day now and into the future. Svante provides the first step toward a circular carbon economy.""SAF is an alternative to conventional jet fuel that, on a lifecycle basis, reduces GHG emissions associated with air travel compared to conventional jet fuel alone. SAF is made from used cooking oil and agricultural waste, and, in the future, could be made from other feedstocks, including household trash, forest waste, or compressed CO2, the end product of Svante's carbon capture process.The Federal Government Recognizes the Value of SAFThe 2022 Inflation Reduction Act includes the largest governmental climate change investments in U.S. history -- a new blended tax credit specifically for SAF along with other critical incentives for clean energy and carbon capture – that will help spur an increase in SAF infrastructure and supply while lowering costs for SAF consumers.The U.S. military currently uses nearly five billion gallons of jet fuel annually and the Department of Defense will use a jet fuel blend containing at least 10% SAF by 2028 because of the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act.And according to the U.S. Department of Energy, the country's vast feedstock resources are enough to meet the projected SAF demand of the entire U.S. aviation industry.United's Commitment to Net-Zero Emissions by 2050United was the first airline to commit to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets. In addition to the UAV Sustainable Flight FundSM, United has launched a SAF purchasing program called the Eco-Skies Alliance and established a venture fund - United Airlines Ventures - to identify and invest in companies and technologies that can decarbonize air travel. These strategic investments include carbon capture, hydrogen-electric engines, electric regional aircraft and air taxis.About UnitedUnited's shared purpose is ""Connecting People.

For nearly 25 years, the self-described data geek leveraged data and its increasingly abundant and sophisticated capture mechanisms to lead risk management and credit risk reporting functions for some of the largest banks in the Southeast before taking on his current data-intensive role as business analytics group manager for PNC's Corporate Responsibility Group.""I have always had a deep appreciation for data, what it can tell us and how it can help us develop solutions to business challenges,"" says Kearney, a North Carolina State University graduate who joined PNC Bank through its acquisition of RBC Bank (USA) more than one decade ago.Kearney's unrelenting commitment to accuracy and data integrity proved to be integral to the success he found in his former role managing balance sheet analytics and modeling for PNC's business-critical enterprise and credit risk reporting team. Meanwhile, his passion for mentorship and employee development helped shape a pipeline of PNC leaders, while his membership in the North Carolina Bankers Association's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&amp;I) Council is helping create impact within the financial services landscape of his home state. So it should come as no surprise that when PNC's Corporate Responsibility Officer was searching in 2020 for a talented visionary to oversee data analytics and reporting for PNC's increasingly extensive and far-ranging community commitments, he turned to Kearney.A pronounced focus on corporate responsibility and its measurement was not at all new for PNC at the time of Kearney's appointment; the bank has consistently produced data to quantify its community commitments and earn an 'Outstanding' Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating in every performance evaluation issued since enactment of the CRA more than 40 years ago. But when Kearney joined PNC's Corporate Responsibility Group in 2020 against the backdrop of immense change, opportunity and growth within the company, the importance of elevating awareness, accountability and transparency for corporate responsibility efforts had never been more important.Story continuesContributing to the magnitude of that consequential period was PNC's impending acquisition of BBVA (USA), which when completed in 2021 resulted in a significantly expanded geographic footprint and employee base. Accompanying this acquisition was PNC's development of an ambitious $88 billion, four-year Community Benefits Plan, designed to create meaningful - and measurable - impact for LMI individuals, communities and people of color through financing for residential mortgage and home equity lending, small business loans, community financing loans and investments, and additional charitable giving.""During the development of the Community Benefits Plan, there was no question that data would play a central role in defining, quantifying and communicating the company's deployment of capital and resources to deliver on its commitments, while providing visibility to tangible outcomes of its nationwide corporate responsibility efforts,"" says Kearney. ""A corporate responsibility program or initiative is about so much more than compliance or checking boxes. I heard our CEO, Bill Demchak, reference this as the work that impacts the soul of a company. And data is integral to understanding how and where we can most effectively maximize our impact, setting goals, measuring progress and shining a light on the stories that emerge from our community commitments.""While Kearney's colleagues may synonymize his work with the sophisticated reporting dashboards and data visualizations for which he has become known, these finished deliverables represent just a small fraction of what his role entails. ""I spend the majority of my time exploring, researching and discussing with business partners the challenges and opportunities the company is looking to address, as well as relevant trends and indicators that provide context for those challenges and opportunities,"" he says. ""Only then do I step away and use data to address the objective or question at hand.""As digital and information technology innovations lead to increased availability and access to data, Kearney emphasizes that the business imperative of data stewardship cannot be overstated - and that more data doesn't always translate to better data. ""When leveraging data for measurement and reporting, it is essential for organizations to preserve the integrity of that data by understanding and respecting its intended use - and by being transparent about methodology,"" he says.For organizations in the process of implementing and enhancing corporate responsibility programs, Kearney encourages leaders to be intentional about developing measurable objectives that can be shared with their employees for accountability and transparency. ""Once a corporate responsibility program is put in place, employees want to see it continue,"" he says. ""Incorporating data-driven metrics from the outset - and then regularly reporting on progress -will go a long way when it comes to demonstrating impact and integrity.""The PNC Financial Services Group, Wednesday, March 29, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from The PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: The PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/pnc-financial-services-groupEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: The PNC Financial Services GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/746484/Measuring-the-Work-That-Impacts-the-Soul-of-a-Company]"

Let's take a look at some of those retail names today, specifically Foot Locker, Urban Outfitters, Ross Stores, and Burlington all catching downgrades and sell ratings from UBS in a note published today. Analyst Jay Sole warning of a consumer spending slowdown impacting those companies. Specifically with Foot Locker, Sole points to Nike's emphasis on direct-to-consumer sales impacting Foot Locker share of Nike sales as well as Foot Locker's consumer likely coming under pressure as the economy tightens. Overall, Sole pointed to apparel spending and how that has not been nearly as resilient as, say, travel or other areas. Now, UBS data matches what recent card data out of Bank of America shows as consumer spending on BofA cards has declined at a steady pace throughout the start of this year.But, Dave, I do want to end on a positive note here, so they are still bullish on some names-- Nike, Deckers, On Holding, and Skechers. And really the highlight there is that the high-end consumer will keep buying, and also a lot of those companies are very good at footwear. High-end consumer footwear is going to continue, so those companies are well positioned there versus some of the other companies we named at the top there like a Foot Locker that doesn't have nearly as much of a high-end consumer might not hold up.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, Nike got a 2% move today. Under Armour not mentioned, up 4%, so benefiting from some sort of wins there.But what jumped out to me about what Jay wrote is to many a recession significantly weighing on soft goods sales is a bear case, but for us, it's a base case. And that was-- I know you ended on a high note, and I took it right back down to a very low note. A base case of recession is something we haven't heard in quite some time and not something that any of us are excited to hear, certainly not in the investment space.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: No, certainly not, and a lot of that was based on the spending data that UBS has been tracking now for quite some time. They're seeing a pullback much more earlier and a much bigger pullback than they were initially expecting.You would have to think even some of those names that he still has outperform ratings on wouldn't be posting as strong of a number if we, in fact, do get that recession.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, we hope he's wrong on the recession.]"
162,d9af0ae4-220b-3c66-8211-0e3be1ab1e20,ROST,2023-03-30,Here's Why Ross Stores (ROST) is Marching Ahead of Its Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-ross-stores-rost-154703808.html,1680104823,STORY,"['ROST', 'AEO', 'URBN']","[Ross Stores ROST has been gaining from positive customer response for its improved merchandise and strong value offerings. Also, reduced freight expenses and store-expansion efforts act as upsides.This led to robust fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results, where the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate.Earnings also improved 26% from $1.04 reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Also, the operating margin of 10.7% expanded 90 bps from 9.8% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2021. The merchandise margin increased 15 bps in the quarter, owing to lower ocean freight, which was more than offset by higher markdowns.Moving on, the company remains on track with its store expansion plans, which are focused on continually increasing penetration in existing, as well as new markets. In first-quarter 2023, the company expects to open 19 stores, comprising 11 Ross and eight dd's DISCOUNTS stores. In fiscal 2023, it expects to open 100 stores, including 75 Ross and 25 dd’s DISCOUNTS. These openings do not include the plans to close 10 existing stores in fiscal 2023.Driven by these factors, management issued its guidance for fiscal 2023 and the first quarter which appears encouraging. For fiscal 2023, it expects comps to be relatively flat, whereas it posted a 4% decline in fiscal 2022. ROST envisions sales growth of 2-5% for the 53 weeks ending Feb 3, 2024, in sync with our estimate of 3.6%. Based on the sales view, the company estimates the operating margin for fiscal 2023 to be 10.3-10.7%.The operating margin view incorporates the effects of the resetting of the baseline incentive compensation, higher wages, lower freight costs and the deleveraging effects of flat comps. Further, the operating margin is expected to benefit from the 53rd week to the tune of 20 bps. The company anticipates earnings per share of $4.65-$4.95 for the 53 weeks ending Feb 3, 2024, whereas it posted $4.38 in fiscal 2022. This view is in line with our estimate of $4.8. The extra 53rd week is expected to boost fiscal 2023 earnings per share by 15 cents.For first-quarter fiscal 2023, sales are expected to increase 1-4% year over year. Earnings per share are envisioned between 99 cents and $1.05 for the fiscal first quarter, in sync with our estimate of $1.03. The company reported earnings of 97 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 11.3% in the past year against the industry’s 9.5% decline.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research That said, not all is good for ROST. Continued weakness in the dd’s DISCOUNTS performance, stemming from escalating inflationary pressures and increased promotions, remains concerning. Its top line dropped 3.9% year over year in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022. Although comps improved 1%, the metric came below the year-ago quarter’s growth of 9% due to flat traffic trends.  The comp performance is likely to reflect the continued impacts of elevated inflation on its low- to moderate-income customers.Also, rising costs due to higher distribution expenses act as a deterrent. The cost of goods sold (COGS) of $3,926.2 million increased 4% year over year. As a percentage of sales, COGS was 75.3%, marking a year-over-year increase of 15 basis points (bps). Distribution costs rose 90 bps, owing to the unfavorable timing of pack-away-related expenses and deleverage from its new Houston distribution center.ConclusionAlthough the above-mentioned inflationary pressures are concerning for the near term, we believe that ROST will sustain momentum on the back of strong value offerings, store-expansion efforts and reduced freight expenses. A VGM Score of A and long-term earnings growth rate of 10.5% raise optimism.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks are Urban Outfitters URBN, DICK’S Sporting Goods DKS and American Eagle Outfitters AEO.Urban Outfitters, a leading lifestyle product and services company, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

""I was homeless off and on for 35 years, and you see hard stuff. You have to watch your back.""For three years now, others have been watching Vestal's back at ""this place,"" otherwise known as Community First! Village (CFV), in Austin, Texas.He counts Regions Bank associates Myke Roeschlein and Norman Witcher among them.""My good friend, Myke - my banker - started teaching a monthly financial education class over a year ago,"" said Vestal. ""I've been here since the first class. Myke and Norman are my brothers from another mother.""Myke Roeschlein, manager of Regions' Hutto branch, remembers that first class - and Vestal - vividly.""We had 10 people attend and I could tell several had reservations going in,"" Roeschlein recalled. ""But the second Jeff came in, he literally had his arms wide open. He asked questions and told me how much he appreciated the class. Right off the bat, that's what I noticed.""The two struck up a friendship from a shared experience.""I'm just a person who made it out of some really difficult times,"" said Roeschlein. ""When I was growing up, my mom had struggles with addiction. We slept in tents, parks, homeless shelters and in battered women's shelters. There wasn't really a time growing up when I had a stable place to be.""""Myke could relate to me,"" added Vestal of their instant bond. ""That's the thing about being homeless. You can tell if somebody is for real.""Dispelling the Myths: ""It's About Being Vulnerable Enough to Be Educated""Vestal's three-decade experience with homelessness is unfortunately common. Something else that's common? Lingering misperceptions about the 580,000 Americans experiencing homelessness in 2020.Story continuesAlan Graham, founder and CEO of nonprofit Mobile Loaves &amp; Fishes, which established Community First! Village, is working to address chronic homelessness while also dispelling its many myths.""The greatest misconceptions people still have about people experiencing homelessness is that they're lazy, they chose this lifestyle, are drug addicts or are mentally ill,"" Graham said. ""Living on the streets is nowhere near lazy, it's hard work.""Regions Commercial Banking relationship manager Norman Witcher credits Graham for elevating his awareness and empathy for those experiencing homelessness when they met in 2009.""Alan taught me to look beyond surface level and put myself in the other person's shoes,"" says Witcher, who today serves on the Mobile Loaves &amp; Fishes board of directors and regularly volunteers at CFV. ""It's about being vulnerable enough to be educated. People who are chronically homeless face unheard of amounts of rejection daily. They face more rejection in a day than we do in a lifetime.""Community First! Village: ""We Care About and Help Each Other""CFV's 51-acre haven includes hundreds of RV and micro-homes, laundry facilities, outdoor kitchens, a community market, even an art house and cinema.Those are the structures. But what CFV really provides is in its name: a sense of community for many who have never had it, like Vestal, who underwent an extensive assessment following his pastor's referral before moving into the community.""I love it here,"" he said. ""I have my own house. Not only do I have neighbors and friends, I have a case manager and Family Eldercare. Everyone looks out for everyone. We care about and help each other.""Roeschlein's care and help have empowered Vestal to achieve more than he ever imagined.""When you're on the street, it's hard to keep your money,"" Vestal explained. ""With that street mentality, it's all, ‘Me, me, me, ‘what can I get?' Now that I'm here, I'm cutting back, I'm saving. I have a lot more to learn, and I know Myke can show me.""Roeschlein has also learned some things thanks to Vestal.""It's really important to count your blessings every single day,"" he said. ""And to never forget where you came from and always continue to give back.""It's a friendship where learning - and gratitude - are in abundance.""I am very blessed, I praise and thank God for the Community First! staff and the people who come here and teach like Myke,"" Vestal said.""As soon as I saw Jeff, I could tell his heart was filled with love,"" added Roeschlein. ""Jeff just radiates love. I couldn't be more grateful that I met him.""More about Regions and Community First! Village:In addition to teaching financial education at Community First!

165,ed47e4a8-7f04-371d-8f29-fc1b6e94bc77,RF,2023-03-30,3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks: A Smarter Way to Boost Your Retirement Income,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-ranked-dividend-stocks-131001315.html,1680095401,STORY,"['RF', 'MAA']","[Here's a revealing data point: older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself.Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.In today's economic environment, traditional income investments are not working.In the past, investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady, reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6.50%, whereas the current rate is much lower.The effect of this drop in rates is substantial: over 20 years, the change in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is over $1 million.And lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.Unfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?Invest in Dividend StocksWe feel that these dividend-paying equities - as long as they are from high-quality, low-risk issuers - can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low-yielding Treasury bonds (or other bonds).Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesOne approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3% and positive average annual dividend growth. Numerous stocks hike dividends over time, counterbalancing inflation risks.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.4 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.9%. This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield of 3.96% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.8%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 21.95%. Check Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Plymouth Industrial (PLYM) is paying out a dividend of $0.23 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 4.43% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.9% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 4.76% over the past year. Check Plymouth Industrial (PLYM) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.2 per share, Regions Financial (RF) has a dividend yield of 4.37%. This is compared to the Banks - Southeast industry's yield of 2.44% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 17.65%. Check Regions Financial (RF) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Yes, that's true. As a broad category, bonds carry less risk than stocks. However, the stocks we are talking about - dividend -paying stocks from high-quality companies - can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole.A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies, especially blue chip stocks, increase their dividends over time, helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks, you can still pursue a dividend income strategy. However, it's important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF, which can ultimately reduce your dividend income, working against your strategy. Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest.Bottom LineWhether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, seeking the steady income of dividend-paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress-free retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The annual meeting will be in Salt Lake City, Utah on May 11.The BellTel Retirees have a long and successful history of shareowner advocacy at Verizon, acting as an integral check for better governance practices. Since 2003, they have achieved 12 changes to corporate governance, including three by majority vote (2013, 2007, 2003).The Association of BellTel Retirees is proposing Item #8, a Shareholder Ratification of Annual Equity Awards policy (Aka: “Golden Parachute”) which recommends shareowner approval of any new and renewed senior executive compensation packages that would include severance or termination payments exceeding 2.99 times base salary plus target short-term bonus. A nearly identical retiree proposal achieved a 44% vote in 2022.This measure seeks to strengthen the current policy, which Verizon adopted following a successful 2003 BellTel-backed proposal that achieved 59% of shares voted. Retirees believe much more scrutiny is needed over exit packages, reflective of the one currently available to CEO Hans Vestberg. As disclosed in the 2023 Proxy, Mr. Vestberg could receive $31.6 million, or more than six (6) times his 2022 base salary plus a short-term bonus, upon termination following any change in company control.The second retiree proposal, by BellTel Chairman Thomas M. Steed, which achieved 37% in 2022, would amend Verizon’s Senior Executive Compensation Clawback Policy (Item #7). The current policy allows cancellation or recoupment of cash and equity compensation when executives engage only in “willful misconduct” resulting in a material restatement of the corporation’s financial results. BellTel believes the company’s current policy wording is too vague and lenient to ever be effective.Story continuesProposal #7 urges enhancing the standard from “willful misconduct” to “conduct” that can cause financial or reputational risk to the company.“The executive clawback policy governing senior executives, should reflect the same expectations that all other employees of Verizon are duty-bound to follow. There should not be a double standard,” said Steed, who submitted the proposal. “Since employees can be disciplined or dismissed for failing to execute their duties, senior executives should certainly not be rewarded for harm they cause to the company’s brand or reputation, or actions that result in Verizon needing to pay penalties or restitution.”Retiree and employee shareowners whose shares are held within a Verizon savings/401k plan are required to vote by no later than May 8, 2023.Contact DetailsSabrina Petrafesa+1 646-213-1366SPetrafesa@ButlerPR.comTom Butler+1 646-213-1802TButler@ButlerPR.comCompany Websitehttps://belltelretirees.org/View source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/retiree-shareowners-seek-to-limit-verizon-executive-golden-parachutes-and-enhance-clawback-policy-917302679]"

170,7f72582a-5dc9-3315-b73d-83d1025f1a8c,VZ,2023-03-30,Verizon continues to upgrade Fresno's best network,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-continues-upgrade-fresnos-best-130000243.html,1680094800,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Sourcing LLCRecent upgrades lead to testing results that show Verizon’s network is unbeaten in FresnoFRESNO, Calif., March 29, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verizon has recently made major upgrades to the network serving customers in Fresno, CA. These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Fresno include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:86% of people in Fresno are covered with 5G Ultra Wideband service. That coverage has been expanded recently with the addition of new macro cell sites and small cell sites. The new macro cell sites are providing additional coverage and capacity near North Clovis High School and Clovis Community College in Fresno along with sites to add coverage and capacity to northern, southeast, and downtown areas of the city.In addition to adding more 5G service using C-band spectrum, Verizon is also deploying 5G service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity. Verizon has recently added mmWave most notably at the California State University, Fresno (aka ""Fresno State""), and the River Park Shopping District.Fresno’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. Until this year in Fresno, Verizon has been restricted to using 60 MHz of the spectrum they secured, but by the end of this year, customers in Fresno will be able to take advantage of 100 MHz of C-band, almost doubling the spectrum available for 5G Ultra Wideband. That additional spectrum will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Fresno. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links.  Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Fresno area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Story continues“Today’s world calls for faster speeds, ultra secure connections and improved coverage in more places. We’re dedicated to bringing the best and latest technologies to local communities, and to keeping our customers connected through 5G,” said Phillip French, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon.With these and other technology advancements on Verizon’s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways. This multi-service network powersInternet-of-Things (IoT) devices that do very little networking and stay in place,smartphones with infinite opportunities to use data in a highly mobile environment,home and business internet which provides connectivity via the wireless network for homes, offices and retail environments, andcomplex solutions like Augmented Reality or enterprise real-time video and data analysis that require massive computing capabilities.As 5G technology advances and is even more widely adopted by consumers the variety of solutions that will use Verizon’s network will continue to evolve as well.Fresno, CA customers have an exceptional experience on Verizon’s networkThe recent network upgrades have led to Verizon’s network being unbeaten in Fresno, CA, according to the nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics®. In the most recent test measuring performance of major wireless carriers throughout Fresno, Verizon is unbeaten for overall network performance, as well as in categories including accessibility, reliability and performance in texts and calls. Today’s results show great speeds for Verizon customers in Fresno with Verizon’s median download speed increasing 89% since last year* in the market and peak speeds of up to 334 Mbps.Services from the network customers rely onFor customers in Fresno, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps. It’s ideal for anyone who wants super fast connectivity to stream, game or even work remotely. Verizon Home Internet is reliable and fast enough to power home connected devices: smart TVs, tablets, phones, gaming consoles and more.

And fittingly, at the event, NVDA’s CEO Jensen Huang sat down with OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever to talk about all things AI. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill logged in to get the lowdown and came away with a “clearer understanding of why larger models are needed for accurate prediction.”Sutskever touched on the history of neural networks and the progress made to get to where AI is at right now. One of the criticisms of current models is a lack of accuracy, and the next step will be centered around reliability with the need for users to trust the AI’s responses are accurate.The response might be as straightforward as the AI “supporting retrieval” (providing source links), asking for clarification, or stating that it cannot answer without more information. Sutskever said these advances will occur within the next two years.Having gained 83% year-to-date, NVDA stock has been a beneficiary of all this year’s AI talk, but Gill feels the “magnitude of what both Jensen and Ilya discussed, specifically adding video and audio to multi-model systems, has a much broader reach.” And based on “near-term data center strength, receding gaming headwinds, and greater traction in inference and software markets,” Gill anticipates NVDA’s valuation to increase.In fact, based on “multiples towards the higher end of historical ranges,” the 5-star analyst raised the price target from $270 to $300, suggesting the shares have room for 12% growth in the year ahead. Unsurprisingly, Gill’s rating stays a Buy. (To watch Gill’s track record, click here)Elsewhere on Wall Street, with the addition of 24 Buys, 7 Holds and 2 Sells, the stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Most appear to think the shares have soared enough for now; the average price target currently stands at $274.81, suggesting modest gains of ~2%.

The European Union (“EU”) passenger vehicle market rose 11.5% last month to 802,763 units, marking the seventh straight month of growth. Most EU markets witnessed robust growth. Registrations in Italy, France and Spain rose 17.4%, 9.4% and 19.2%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Germany saw a modest increase of 2.8% in registrations last month. Registrations of battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs) rose 39.7% to 97,300 cars. In the first two months of 2023, EU market vehicle registrations reached 1.6 million units, up 11.4% year over year.On the news front, the used car e-retailer Carvana CVNA came to the spotlight with its plan to restructure its debt load in its latest attempt to stay afloat. The company also announced preliminary first-quarter 2023 results and expects a narrower year-over-year core loss in the quarter to be reported. Auto replacement parts provide Genuine Parts Company GPC partnered with Google Cloud to support business transformation and elevate customers’ experience. The company also laid out its long-term targets.Recreational vehicle maker Winnebago Industries WGO came out with its second-quarter fiscal 2023 results. Itcmanaged to keep its earnings beat streak alive. Meanwhile, Germany-based auto giant Volkswagen's VWAGY withdrawal plan from Russia hit a roadblock after the Russian court froze its assets based on a lawsuit filed by Gaz Group.Last but not least, the U.S. auto biggie Ford F made it to the top stories as it disclosed that its electric vehicle (EV) business is set to report a $3 billion loss this year amid increasing spending. Last year, in one of the boldest steps taken under the leadership of CEO Jim Farley, Ford unveiled its ambitious rejig plan to split its EV business into a separate unit within the company. While Ford Blue will focus on the firm’s legacy gas-powered business, Ford Model e will focus on EVs, advanced technologies and several related aspects to support electrification plans. Meanwhile, Ford Pro will deal with commercial vehicles and services.Story continuesWhile VWAGY currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), GPC, WGO and CVNA are #3 Ranked (Hold). Meanwhile, F carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Last Week’s Top StoriesGenuine Parts announced a partnership with Google Cloud to draw on the latter’s spectrum of services. Google Cloud’s trailblazing data and analytics platforms are set to modernize Genuine Parts’ supply chain and improve customer experience. With a multitude of services provided by Google Cloud, Genuine Parts plans to optimize its tech infrastructure to support more than 10,000 stores and fulfillment centers across the globe.The company also hosted its 2023 Investor Day last week and reaffirmed its outlook for the current year. GPC also provided an update on its long-term target and growth initiatives.For 2023, the auto replacement part distributor expects its automotive sales growth, industrial sales growth and total sales growth within the range of 4-6%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per share are both expected to be between $8.85 and $8.95.Genuine Parts expects its total sales and EBITDA to range within $26.5 billion-$27 billion and $2.65 billion-$2.75 billion, respectively, for 2025. Earnings per share are expected to fall within the range of $11.00-$11.50. During the span of three years (2023-2025), the company projects its sales to record a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6-7%. Earnings per share are likely to see a CAGR of 10-11%. Cumulative free cash flow for the three years is expected within the range of $2.6 billion-$2.8 billion.Winnebago reported adjusted earnings of $1.88 per share for second-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Feb 25, 2023), which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32 on higher-than-anticipated EBITDA across all segments. The bottom line, however, plunged 40% year over year. The company reported revenues of $866.7 million in the quarter under review, crossing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $781 million. Nonetheless, the top line fell 25.5% year over year.Revenues in the Towable segment in the reported quarter fell 47% year over year to $342.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA declined 60.9% to $39.3 million. The segment’s backlog was $278.2 million (5,841 units), decreasing 85.1%. Revenues in the Motorhome segment slid 3.3% year over year to $403.8 million. The segment recorded an EBITDA of $42.5 million, down 7.8%. The backlog was $872.7 million (5,341 units), down 60.6% from the prior year. Revenues in the Marine segment were $112.9 million, jumping 16.1%. The segment recorded an EBITDA of $14.4 million, up 11.4% year over year. The backlog for the Marine segment was $238.5 million (2,511 units), down 14.1%.Winnebago had cash and cash equivalents of $229.3 million as of Feb 25, 2023. The long-term debt (excluding current maturities) increased to $591 million from $545.9 million, recorded on Aug 27, 2022. The company approved a dividend of 27 cents a share, to be paid on Apr 26, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Apr 12, 2023.Carvana announced that it is offering its creditors an option to exchange their unsecured notes at a premium to current trading prices for new secured notes backed by collateral. The offer is for exchanging as much as $1 billion of bonds, including a condition that at least $500 million existing notes be validly tendered. The exchange will push back repayment on some obligations to 2028 from as early as 2025. It will also help in “reducing Carvana’s cash interest expense and maintaining significant flexibility,” per the company.The company is offering to swap five series of bonds, maturing between 2025 and 2030. Per Financial Times, “if fully subscribed, the exchange offer to existing creditors would reduce the face value of its outstanding $5.7 billion of unsecured bond debt by $1.3 billion and its annual cash interest bill by roughly $100 million. If fully subscribed, $1 billion of secured bonds would replace $1.3bn of unsecured debt.”The company also released its preliminary first-quarter 2023 results. CVNA expects adjusted negative EBITDA in the band of $50-$100 million, implying an improvement from $348 million in the corresponding quarter of 2022 due to higher GPU and lower SG&amp;A costs.While the company expects an improvement in EBITDA thanks to operational efficiency, it estimates retail units sold in the first quarter of 2023 to be between 76,000 and 79,000 units, down from 105,185 in the year-ago period. Consequently, total revenues are envisioned in the range of $2.4-$2.6 billion, implying a decline from $3.5 billion in the first quarter of 2022.Volkswagen’s efforts to wind down its operations in Russia suffered a massive blow last week as the Russian court froze its assets. Last year, amid mounting tension between Russia and Ukraine, the German automaker announced to cease production in Russia. The automaker has been trying to sell its Russian assets, which include its flagship plant in Kaluga and an automotive assembly plant in Nizhny Novgorod, which it used to run in collaboration with local carmaker Gaz Group.Gaz filed a lawsuit against Volkswagen, claiming that the latter abruptly ended the agreement that was due to run until 2025 and sought to freeze the German automaker’s assets. In its filing, Gaz mentioned that Volkswagen’s plan to leave the Russian market conflicts with its own interest and claimed compensation of RUB 15.6 billion.In response to the filing, the Russian court froze Volkswagen’s shares in its Russian subsidiary Volkswagen Rus, shares in four different financial services companies along with several factories and manufacturing equipment.Volkswagen’s Russian subsidiary said that it is stunned by the lawsuit and that their partnership ""ended on mutually agreed terms."" In a statement to Reuters, it said, ""We are aware of the claim from GAZ and are familiarizing ourselves with the case materials.""Ford anticipates its EV business unit to witness a pretax loss of $3 billion this year. As we know, effective first-quarter of 2023 results to be released on May 2, the U.S. legacy automaker will report its automotive results under three business segments — Ford Model e, Ford Blue and Ford Pro. Till now, it used to report based on geographical regions.Ford expects Model e’s cumulative three-year loss (2021-2023) to be around $6 billion, including a pro-forma loss of $900 million and $2.1 billion in 2021 and 2022, respectively.Nonetheless, the auto giant expects its first generation of EVs, including the F-150 e-pickup and Mustang Mach E, to become profitable on a pretax basis by the end of next year. The automaker reaffirms its target to produce 600,000 EVs by the end of 2023 and 2 million by 2026-end. It also forecasts the Model e unit to achieve a pretax profit margin of 8% by late 2026.As for Ford Blue, the company expects pretax income from the segment to increase nominally by around 3% year over year to $7 billion. Ford Pro unit’s pretax income is expected to almost double to $6 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, Ford Credit profits are expected to decline around 50% year over year to $1.3 billion.Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some of the major auto players over the last week and six-month period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat's Next in the Auto Space?Industry watchers will keep a tab on February commercial vehicle registrations to be released by the ACEA.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

At current consumption rates, it's estimated by 2050 around two-thirds of the world's population will be facing water shortages.Those sobering statistics led Cummins to create Cummins Water Works. Launched in 2021, the program partners with leading water experts to invest and engage in sustainable, large-scale, high-impact water initiatives around the world. By 2030, the program's goal is to help Cummins become net water positive by creating community water benefits that exceed the company's water usage in all regions where Cummins has a presence.The multi-million-dollar program has projects underway in Brazil, Canada, China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, South Africa and the United States.One of the larger efforts taking place this month was in Guarulhos, Brazil, near São Paulo, the most populous city in the country.

As such, the price of the stock isn't as big of a factor as it may have been in the past.Instead, the quality of a company's business, its competitive advantages, and its future earnings growth potential matters far more to a stock price.Buying blue chips with growth potential and competitive advantages is often times better than buying an average stock in the long term as blue chips are generally well known and established companies that are profitable.In terms of growth, some leading technology blue chip stocks have potential future growth potential.Many investors think that artificial intelligence will be the fourth industrial revolution and one that will allow the world to produce substantially more products and services as well as innovative products.

Because it takes a lot of computer processing, existing big tech companies with substantial computer processing capability, data, and financial resources have a advantage in terms of future growth. Some other leading tech companies such as The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) can also play a role in the future with their own niches with licensing for instance.Story continuesBecause AI is so fast changing, some leading tech companies could be left behind if they don't innovate enough even though they are dominating now.

Disney said at the time that Perlmutter would continue to oversee Marvel properties.In 2015, Disney CEO Bob Iger restructured Marvel, placing Marvel Studios under Walt Disney Studios. Iger described the decision in his autobiography, ""The Ride of a Lifetime,"" saying he detected ""a growing tension"" between the New York-based Marvel team and the film group in Hollywood, adding, ""I had to intervene.""It was a decision that multiple sources say angered Perlmutter, who retained the title of chairman of Marvel Entertainment, but would have no oversight of the film studio's budgets or creative process.Perlmutter, who friends say was upset with Disney's financial performance under its former chief executive, Bob Chapek, took the unusual step of contacting Disney board members and executives multiple times last year to advocate for Peltz to join the board, according to regulatory filings.Story continuesPeltz and Perlmutter are friends who travel in the same social circles in Palm Beach, Florida.Disney insiders had expressed incredulity at Perlmutter's work on behalf of an activist shareholder. One outside advisor to the entertainment company said Perlmutter may have been motivated by his anger at seeing his role at the company diminished.The New York Times first reported Perlmutter's ouster.(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski and Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles, Urvi Dugar in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath and Nick Zieminski)]"

(NYSE:NRG) was covered in the 2019 letter with VST. We sold the shares as COVID induced volatility presented better risk/reward opportunities, but never subsequently repurchased shares—as we did with VST. Not only do we think VST is a better value, but the management team at NRG appears to have gone astray. Despite coming to his position during an activist campaign by Elliott Management in 2017, when the prior empire-building CEO was shown the door, the replacement CEO has seemingly embarked on the same failed strategy. In early December they announced the purchase of Vivint Smart Home, a smart home platform company, for $2.8 billion. The transaction diversifies NRG’s business, increases leverage, dramatically reduces intermediate-term shareholder capital returns, and most importantly, is the opposite of what management told us they were going to do when they assumed the role in 2017. The stock fell 15% on the day of the announcement and is down another 5% since then, and now 10% lower than when we first wrote about it. We like the generation business at NRG and the valuation is almost back to interesting, but we’d probably have to see turnover in the C-suite and a refreshed corporate strategy to reignite our enthusiasm.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Utility Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:11 Best Communication Stocks to Buy10 Best Used Car Stocks to Buy15 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure: None. 16 Best Utility Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If you want to see more best affordable tech stocks to buy now, go directly to 5 Best Affordable Tech Stocks to Buy Now.If a stock is priced at $100 per share or even $200 a share, more investors would be able to afford it than if it were priced at $1000 per share.Nevertheless affordability is only one minor factor of a stock as most of the capital in the markets are held by institutions or wealthy individuals where the price of a stock doesn't really matter. As such, the price of the stock isn't as big of a factor as it may have been in the past.Instead, the quality of a company's business, its competitive advantages, and its future earnings growth potential matters far more to a stock price.Buying blue chips with growth potential and competitive advantages is often times better than buying an average stock in the long term as blue chips are generally well known and established companies that are profitable.In terms of growth, some leading technology blue chip stocks have potential future growth potential.Many investors think that artificial intelligence will be the fourth industrial revolution and one that will allow the world to produce substantially more products and services as well as innovative products. Goldman Sachs recently estimated that generative AI could eventually help increase annual global GDP by 7% by increasing productivity. In the future, more advanced AI could help economic growth even further.For those of you interested, check out 10 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy.In the new AI and tech landscape where things can change fairly quickly, the future is uncertain. Although no one knows for sure which companies will succeed and which ones won't, the big tech companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the United States that have invested a lot into AI have some advantages. Because it takes a lot of computer processing, existing big tech companies with substantial computer processing capability, data, and financial resources have a advantage in terms of future growth. Some other leading tech companies such as The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) can also play a role in the future with their own niches with licensing for instance.Story continuesBecause AI is so fast changing, some leading tech companies could be left behind if they don't innovate enough even though they are dominating now. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Analysis, finances, workPhoto by Carlos Muza on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 14 Best Affordable Tech Stocks to Buy Now, we chose 14 tech stocks with competitive advantages that trade for around $200 or under.We then ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q4.14 Best Affordable Tech Stocks to Buy Now14.

The company is considered one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up.America’s No. 2 energy firm’s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin. As a reflection of these positives, we saw CVX’s EPS jump 132% in 2022.However, Chevron was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially. The company’s high oil price sensitivity is a concern too. Moreover, the supermajor’s 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% is indicative of its inability to replace the amount of energy produced.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Coca-Cola have gained +8.4% over the past six months against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry’s gain of +13.3%. The company’s results benefited from the continued momentum in its business.

It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments.It provided an upbeat guidance for 2023. However, shares of Coca-Cola lagged the industry year to date. Pressures from higher supply chain costs, including transportation and input costs hurt gross margin.

Investments in innovation and productivity improvement should fuel the company’s growth. Also, its shareholder-friendly policies are praiseworthy.However, supply-chain disruptions, including labor and material shortages and high logistics costs, are weighing on General Electric’s performance. Raw material cost inflation poses a threat to the company’s bottom-line performance. Weakness in the Renewable Energy segment due to lower volumes is concerning.

It's unclear when McDonald began representing Coley in the U.S. investigations, though he appeared as her attorney of record in separate civil litigation against Binance.US in January 2022, court records show. His representation of Coley has not been previously reported.On Monday, the CFTC charged Binance and its chief executive and founder Changpeng Zhao with willful evasion of U.S. laws for operating an ""illegal"" exchange and a ""sham"" compliance programme. The CFTC's civil complaint did not name Coley. The Justice Department has also been investigating Binance over money laundering and sanctions violations.Reuters could not determine Coley's status in the government investigations or whether she had cooperated. The Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission have sought records and communications involving Coley from Binance and Binance.US, Reuters has previously reported, citing the governments' written requests.McDonald declined to comment and Coley did not respond to multiple messages. She has not made any public comments since leaving Binance.US or ever addressed her exit. The CFTC, DOJ and SEC declined to comment. Contacted by Reuters, Binance and Binance.US didn't comment on Coley's representation.McDonald left the CFTC in 2020. While he was its director of enforcement, the CFTC increasingly worked on investigations in parallel with federal prosecutors. Prior to joining the CFTC, McDonald worked in the public corruption unit of the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office.Story continuesMcDonald's representation of Coley comes as the U.S. investigations pile pressure on Binance, which dominates the crypto sector as the world's largest digital currency exchange. In a blog post, Zhao called the CFTC's charges ""unexpected and disappointing,"" adding ""we do not agree with the characterization of many of the issues alleged in the complaint.""Coley, a former Morgan Stanley trader, left Binance.US in mid-2021 after clashing with Zhao over his control of the American exchange, which was set up to serve U.S. customers in compliance with U.S. laws, Reuters reported last October, citing people familiar with her exit.Although Binance.US publicly said it operated independently as a partner, Zhao in reality managed the American firm as a de-facto subsidiary and his finance team had access to its bank account, according to banking records and company messages Reuters reviewed for an article in February. The finance team transferred hundreds of millions of dollars out of the account to a trading firm managed by Zhao, leading Coley to express concern to Binance staff about the outflows, the records and messages showed.Asked for comment for this article, Binance.US's head of legal Krishna Juvvadi criticized the February piece as containing untrue assertions, including that a Binance finance executive had access to Binance.US's bank accounts. Juvvadi asked to discuss with Reuters the results of an internal Binance.US investigation into the article's findings, but did not follow up on the offer. He did not comment on Coley.The CFTC's complaint said that Binance personnel, including Zhao, have ""dictated Binance.US's corporate strategy, launch, and early operations."" Without naming Coley, the CFTC said that when Zhao hired the first chief executive of Binance.US's operating company, BAM Trading, he described the global Binance.com exchange as a ""pirate ship"" and explained ""he wished for Binance.US to be a navy boat.""Even after Binance.US launched, Zhao continued to grow and conceal the global exchange's U.S. user base and was focused on retaining the liquidity and revenue American customers supplied, the complaint said.The Justice Department asked Binance to hand over communications that involved Coley and twelve other Binance executives and advisors in a December 2020 document request, including in relation to the creation of Binance.US and the exchange's recruitment of U.S. customers. In a subpoena addressed to Coley that same month, the SEC also requested all records of her activities and meetings.The following April, Binance.US announced it would replace Coley as CEO. Previously a regular social media user, Coley has not posted anything on her Twitter account since her exit.(Reporting by Angus Berwick in London and Chris Prentice in New York; additional reporting by Tom Wilson in London; editing by Elisa Martinuzzi and Janet McBride)]"

Last month, management announced it is trimming 10% of its officers and directors to reduce costs, along with cutting flights, removing delivery routes, reducing office space, improving courier efficiency and making adjustments to the ground unit that allowed the company to save $1.2 billion on total enterprise costs YoY. During the earnings call, CEO stated that certain staffing-related expenses were down 8% YoY with flight hours reduced by 8% and salary and benefit expenses by 4%.Flight hours are expected to be reduced by double digits with plans to park additional planes in the undergoing quarter as the company expects to save another $50 million.Fiscal Third Quarter FiguresRevenue dropped 6% to $22.2 billion with net income amounting to $771 million for the period, down from $1.11 billion earned during last year’s comparable quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, per-share earnings of $3.41 did beat estimates but still translate to a dramatic YoY decline from the $4.59 per share earned during last year’s comparable quarter.Story continuesFedEx’s OutlookTo offset cooling demand, FedEx raised its shipping rate by approximately 6.9% in January and during the earnings call, it reported an 11% increase in revenue per shipment during its fiscal third quarter, expecting volumes to improve in the undergoing quarter and into its fiscal first quarter of next year. The company reiterated it is expecting to make more than $4 billion in cost reductions by the end of fiscal 2025. Investors will be updated on April 5thwhere the company will also be expected to comment on tense contract negotiations with its pilots that has been going on since May 2021.DHL’s Q4 Results Showed Strong Year, But Offered A Weak GuidanceDuring the last three months of 2022, DHL’s income dropped 13% in part to a drop in key air freight volumes and an inflation-pressured consumer spending. DHL expects plenty of economic headwinds this year, with the first half being a continuation of the unfavorable trend from 2022’s last quarter.  Deutsche Post noted that this customer caution caused by the elevated prices is also expected to hamper the development of business-to-consumer volumes throughout the year. The group laid out three scenarios for the full year earnings before interest and taxes that ranged between €6 billion and €7 billion, with any return from this range being lower from its record-high 2022 operating income that amounted to €8.4 billion.UPS Missed On Revenue And Flags Of A Dip UnderwayIn its latest report on January 31st, the U.S. shipping company reported mixed fourth-quarter results. For the quarter ended on December 31st, UPS made an adjusted net income of $3.15 billion and $3.62 per share that topped Wall Street’s expectations on earnings with record profit, but it missed on revenue as international and supply chain segments saw volume declines. Moreover, it advised annual revenue could decline for the first time since 2009, providing a full-year guidance that was fell below analyst’s expectations, although things are expected to get better during the second half of the year. Revenue is expected in the range between $97 billion and $99.4 billion, below analysts’ estimates of $99.98 billion as headwinds in the form of rising interest rates, high inflation and other macroeconomic factors continue harming the top line.2023 Is Expected To Be BumpyUPS’ CFO Brian Newman said it. CEO Carol Tomé has been leading with a “Better not Bigger” business strategy that got adjusted to “Better and Bolder” last quarter, as the focus was placed on high-margin shipments rather than just boosting volume. UPS aims to use automation to optimize capacity during periods of shifting volumes, a strategy that was put in practice during the reported quarter in which declining volumes hurt the top line. Along with a bumpy macro environment, UPS is also preparing for labor negotiations in the coming fiscal year with its current contracts set to expire on July 31st.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

(NYSE:UPS) has experienced a revenue reduction only once in the past 25 years. That occurred in 2008 and was a result of the economic slowdown that came with the Financial Crisis. Otherwise, its top line has moved upward every year. Since 1998, it has recorded average revenue growth of 5.20% per year. However, that's about to change as UPS guides for lower revenue in 2023.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with MKC. Click here to check it out. UPS 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of UPSPeter Lynch Chart of UPSCould this be the end of UPS' growth story? I don't think so. The future will be determined by UPS' capital allocation strategy, and the company definitely isn't slacking off in this respect.Abut UPSFounded in 1907, UPS delivered 24.3 million packages a day last year, according to its 10-K for 2022. Strategically, UPS focuses on the parts of its market that benefit from its end-to-end network, delivering packages all the way from the original shipper to the end receiver.Its market includes individual homes as well as small- and medium-sized businesses, health care, international and some large enterprises. It operates through three segments: U.S. Domestic Package, International Package and Supply Chain Solutions. All its services are managed through a single, global smart logistics network. Capital allocationLong-term and consistent growth is only possible with good capital allocation. How a company distributes money among conflicting priorities will determine its financial success and its returns to shareholders.UPS claims in its annual filing that it takes a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. According to its fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 presentation, the company invested in capital expenditures, dividends and debt repayment.It had cash flows from operations of $14.1 billion for the year. From that, it deducted CapEx of $4.8 billion and other investing activities of $380 million. That left free cash flow of $9.0 billion.Story continuesOf the $4.8 in CapEx, $1.7 billion went into buildings and facilities. Another $1.3 billion went into aircraft and $1.1 billion went into vehicles, while $723 million went into information technology.These investments, or reinvestments, will drive growth in the longer term. The capital going into buildings, planes and trucks is self-explanatory. The investment in information technology is more interesting in an analytical sense. As noted above, it calls its logistical system a ""global smart logistics network."" UPS noted in its annual filing, Our sophisticated engineering systems allow us to optimize network efficiency and asset utilization. In other words, it likely can provide something along the lines of a continual improvement process for logistics.Thats an important competitive advantage, and a way to continue growing earnings more quickly than revenue. Over the past three years, the company's revenue growth averaged 10.4% per year while earnings per share without non-recurring items grew by an average of 37.2%.Shareholder returnsDividends and share repurchases are also key ingredients of a capital allocation recipe. Altogether, UPS returned $8.6 billion to shareholders in 2022. That was made up of $3.5 billion in share buybacks and $5.1 billion in dividends.In 2022, the company boosted its dividend by roughly 50%. In 2021, it paid shareholders $4.08 annually and in 2022, the dividend went up to $6.08. In the first quarter of 2023, it increased again to $6.48. As a result, UPS now yields 3.29%, which is nearly twice as much as the S&amp;P 500 average in December.It also appears the company is aiming to become a Dividend Aristocrat, which is a stock included on the S&amp;P 500 that has increased its dividend every year for the past 25 years or more.Over the past 10 years, UPS has reduced its share count by an average of 0.59% per year.The dividend and share buybacks make it easier to raise new capital by issuing new shares. Capital from a new share issuance makes more funds available for investment in business growth without hurting the balance sheet.UPS has also made debt reduction another key use of capital, which I count as a way to return value to shareholders:Is UPS's Growth Nearing an End?After increasing its long-term debt substantially between 2014 and 2018, it made substantial reductions in 2021 and 2022. The repayments cut the debt load from $21.74 billion at the end of 2020 to $17.00 billion at the end of 2022.The repayments also allowed the company to get back to its adjusted-debt-to-Ebitda ratio target of 1.4 to 1.5. The company's 2022 presentation noted that the ratio had been near 3.5 at the end of 2020.Debt repayment reduces the amount of interest the company must pay, freeing up capital that can go to CapEx or to shareholder rewards. In addition, it makes the balance sheet more attractive to investors. Both effects help make capital available for later expansion.OutlookLooking forward to the remainder of this year, UPS expects revenue to fall back from over $100 billion in 2022 to something between $97 billion and $99.4 billion in 2023. As for the uses of capital in 2023, it plans CapEx of $5.3 billion, dividend payments of $5.4 billion and share repurchases of $3 billion (all are estimates, of course).UPS may not be able to keep up the pace in the short term due to the struggling economy, but I dont expect it to slow its growth in the long term. Americas biggest delivery company has a capital allocation strategy that should continue to please its shareholders in the years to come.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

(UPS): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-united-parcel-130001138.html,1680094801,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service (UPS) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this package delivery service have returned +2.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, which UPS falls in, has gained 4.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UPS is expected to post earnings of $2.23 per share, indicating a change of -26.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.3% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.45 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -11.5%. This estimate has changed -1.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.69 indicates a change of +2.1% from what UPS is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for UPS.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UPS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For UPS, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $22.96 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -5.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $97.75 billion and $100.49 billion estimates indicate -2.6% and +2.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUPS reported revenues of $27.03 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.7%. EPS of $3.62 for the same period compares with $3.59 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.95 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.27%. The EPS surprise was +1.12%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UPS is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UPS. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

His portfolio looks about as rock-solid as any fund I’ve ever seen.Thus, even within the group of Warren Buffett stocks investors can look at, investors can still get lost regarding which companies to hold. Here are my three top picks in Berkshire’s portfolio I think are worth buying right now, for those looking to sleep easy at night.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAXPAmerican Express$18.47OXYOccidental Petroleum$58.18KOCoca-Cola$60.90American Express (AXP)the American Express logo etched into woodSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett has owned an interest in American Express (NYSE:AXP) for nearly 90 years. He controls approximately 150 million shares in AXP stock, valued at around $26 billion. This investment represents around 20% of the company, and it makes Warren Buffett the largest shareholder of American Express by a wide margin.Buffett’s fondness for American Express stems from its popular credit cards among business and leisure users. As a way to play a surging American economy over the long-term, AXP stock has turned out to be a solid proxy.In various interviews, Buffett has repeatedly praised American Express for its resilient brand and dedicated customer base. He appreciates the company’s focus on a more affluent clientele, and has observed that American Express has maintained low levels of bad loans during economic downturns.Story continuesBuffett clearly likes what he sees in terms of the company’s fundamentals. While earnings per share declined to $2.09 this past quarter, revenues grew by 17% on a year-over-year basis. Thus, American Express’ clientele appears to be on good footing right now. For Buffett and all investors, that’s a good thing.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comAccording to recent regulatory filings in March, Berkshire Hathaway appears to be as bullish as ever on the future prospects of oil major Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). The company augmented its significant holding in OXY stock this month, adding to its already substantial stake.Notably, this bet marks the first time Warren Buffett has increased his OXY stock holdings since September. Currently, Berkshire holds more than 200 million shares of the oil giant, worth roughly $12 billion. This subsequent purchase has elevated the conglomerate’s stake in the company to 22.2%, up from 21.4%.While it was one of the top performers in the S&amp;P 500 in 2022 and a key holding for Berkshire, Occidental Petroleum’s stock has dropped more than 5% in value this year. Indeed, weaker oil price dynamic have hurt the valuations of many top oil producing stocks. Occidental has been no exception.That said, there’s a clear reason Buffett continues to hold on to his position in Occidental. The Oracle of Omaha believes in CEO Vicki Hollub, putting his faith explicitly behind her leadership style. It’s clear that Occidental is a cash flow producing machine, something Buffett also likes.Over the long-term, I think Warren Buffett will certainly be proven right with this core holding.Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comCoca-Cola’s (NYSE:KO) dividend growth has caught Warren Buffett’s attention and may also interest you. Coca-Cola now offers its shareholders a yearly residual income of $1.84 per share. However, that payout is expected to grow in the future according to historical success.Like other dividend paying stocks Warren Buffett owns, Coca-Cola is among the select group of Dividend Kings the Oracle of Omaha has stuck with for decades.As Coke increases its earnings, the company passes on this increased value to shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks. Thus, it’s the kind of mature company a mega-conglomerate such as Berkshire Hathaway wants to own.While Coca-Cola’s growth potential is likely more muted than other holdings in the Berkshire portfolio, this stock is about as stable and defensive as they come.Those concerned about a potential recession on the horizon may want to consider adding such defensive positioning right now. Personally, KO stock is one of the best ways to do so, in my view.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in KO. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

(NYSE:NRG) was covered in the 2019 letter with VST. We sold the shares as COVID induced volatility presented better risk/reward opportunities, but never subsequently repurchased shares—as we did with VST. Not only do we think VST is a better value, but the management team at NRG appears to have gone astray. Despite coming to his position during an activist campaign by Elliott Management in 2017, when the prior empire-building CEO was shown the door, the replacement CEO has seemingly embarked on the same failed strategy. In early December they announced the purchase of Vivint Smart Home, a smart home platform company, for $2.8 billion. The transaction diversifies NRG’s business, increases leverage, dramatically reduces intermediate-term shareholder capital returns, and most importantly, is the opposite of what management told us they were going to do when they assumed the role in 2017. The stock fell 15% on the day of the announcement and is down another 5% since then, and now 10% lower than when we first wrote about it. We like the generation business at NRG and the valuation is almost back to interesting, but we’d probably have to see turnover in the C-suite and a refreshed corporate strategy to reignite our enthusiasm.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Utility Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:11 Best Communication Stocks to Buy10 Best Used Car Stocks to Buy15 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure: None. 16 Best Utility Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

216,da7dfe76-3067-3be5-96a1-b958bb7a589a,MDLZ,2023-03-30,4 Stocks to Buy on Rebound in March Consumer Confidence,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-buy-rebound-march-120712192.html,1680091632,STORY,"['HSY', 'GIS', 'MDLZ']","[Americans seem more optimistic for the first time in months despite the recent turmoil in the banking sector and the Fed’s continuation of the interest rate hike. Inflation is still at multi-year highs, and consumers believe that the situation is unlikely to change over the next year.However, they are confident about the underlying strength in the economy, which is likely to save it from slipping into a recession as the Fed will finally manage to bring inflation down. Given this situation, it would be ideal to invest in defensive sector stocks such as consumer staples.Consumer Confidence Rises in MarchThe Conference Board said on Mar 28 that the Consumer Confidence Index rose to 104.2 in March from an upwardly revised 103.4 in February. The unexpected jump in March also came in above the consensus estimate of a reading of 101.The solid rebound comes despite the recent turmoil in the banking sector that triggered a massive selloff in financial stocks following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate Corporation. Since then, things have become worse with the bank's collapse and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation taking over the management of the banks.However, consumers are still confident. The consumer confidence survey showed that an increasing number of people are planning to buy automobiles and household consumer durables like refrigerators, television sets, vacuum cleaners and washing machines over the next six months.The increase in consumer confidence for the upcoming six months helped the headline index for March. The Expectations Index improved to 73 in March from 70.4 in February. However, the Present Situation Index fell to 151.1 from 153 in the previous month.The 12-month inflation expectations of consumers increased from 6.2% to 6.3% in March. This came as the Fed increased interest rates by another 25 basis points in March, and officials said earlier in the month that the central bank will have to continue raising interest rates for a longer time than expected in order to fight soaring inflation.Story continuesInvestors, however, have been feeling confident after fears of a liquidity crisis in the U.S. financial system somewhat waned following an assurance from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that the banking sector is on solid ground.However, the survey showed that consumers’ expectations of inflation rising over the next year has made them more inclined toward slashing spending on consumer discretionary goods, including visiting amusement parks and dining out.Despite rising costs, people will need to spend on consumer staples and other necessities. Such stocks are unlikely to be affected by market volatility and rising inflation and recession worries. Thus, consumer staples stocks are currently a safe pick for investors.The sector is known for the transparency and consistency of its profitability and cash flow. So, adding stocks to a portfolio from the consumer staples basket makes it more resilient in a choppy market.Our ChoicesThe Hershey Company HSY is the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America as well as a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.VAREX IMAGING and Boston Scientific are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that VREX has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.VREX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.12, while BSX has a forward P/E of 25.51. We also note that VREX has a PEG ratio of 0.52. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. BSX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.28.Another notable valuation metric for VREX is its P/B ratio of 1.37. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, BSX has a P/B of 3.96.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help VREX earn a Value grade of A, while BSX has been given a Value grade of C.VREX has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than BSX, so it seems like value investors will conclude that VREX is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

220,30a3d6dd-0a93-373c-9b9c-91a599a01ef8,BSX,2023-03-30,The Returns On Capital At Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) Don't Inspire Confidence,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-boston-scientific-nyse-120020454.html,1680091220,STORY,['BSX'],"[If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after investigating Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Boston Scientific:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.071 = US$2.0b ÷ (US$32b - US$3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, Boston Scientific has an ROCE of 7.1%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.9%. View our latest analysis for Boston Scientific roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Boston Scientific compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Boston Scientific.The Trend Of ROCEWe weren't thrilled with the trend because Boston Scientific's ROCE has reduced by 41% over the last five years, while the business employed 114% more capital. Usually this isn't ideal, but given Boston Scientific conducted a capital raising before their most recent earnings announcement, that would've likely contributed, at least partially, to the increased capital employed figure. It's unlikely that all of the funds raised have been put to work yet, so as a consequence Boston Scientific might not have received a full period of earnings contribution from it.Story continuesOn a side note, Boston Scientific has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 12% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. Effectively this means their suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of the business, which reduces some elements of risk. Some would claim this reduces the business' efficiency at generating ROCE since it is now funding more of the operations with its own money.In Conclusion...Bringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Boston Scientific's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 75% over the last five years. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.Boston Scientific does have some risks, we noticed   4 warning signs  (and 1 which doesn't sit too well with us)  we think you should know about.While Boston Scientific isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

The company is considered one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up.America’s No. 2 energy firm’s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin. As a reflection of these positives, we saw CVX’s EPS jump 132% in 2022.However, Chevron was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially. The company’s high oil price sensitivity is a concern too. Moreover, the supermajor’s 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% is indicative of its inability to replace the amount of energy produced.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Coca-Cola have gained +8.4% over the past six months against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry’s gain of +13.3%.

It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments.It provided an upbeat guidance for 2023. However, shares of Coca-Cola lagged the industry year to date. Pressures from higher supply chain costs, including transportation and input costs hurt gross margin.

Investments in innovation and productivity improvement should fuel the company’s growth. Also, its shareholder-friendly policies are praiseworthy.However, supply-chain disruptions, including labor and material shortages and high logistics costs, are weighing on General Electric’s performance. Raw material cost inflation poses a threat to the company’s bottom-line performance. Weakness in the Renewable Energy segment due to lower volumes is concerning.

Among these, Viking Therapeutics, Inc.  VKTX soared on obesity data, while Incyte INCY suffered a setback for ruxolitinib extended-release (XR) tablets.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories:Viking Soars on Study Results:  Viking Therapeutics announced positive results from the phase I single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) clinical study of VK2735 for obesity. VK2735 is a novel dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors in development for the potential treatment of various metabolic disorders.VK2735 demonstrated promising safety and tolerability, as well as a predictable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in the SAD portion of the study. Following single subcutaneous doses, VK2735 demonstrated a half-life of 170 to 250 hours, a Tmax (time to reach maximum plasma concentration) ranging from 75 to 90 hours, and excellent therapeutic exposures. VK2735 demonstrated encouraging tolerability and positive signs of clinical activity in the MAD portion of the study. All cohorts receiving VK2735 showed reductions in mean body weight from baseline, ranging up to 7.8%. Cohorts receiving VK2735 also demonstrated reductions in mean body weight relative to placebo, ranging up to 6.0%Data also showed statistically significant differences compared to placebo were maintained or improved at the day 43 follow-up time point, 21 days after the last dose of VK2735 was administered. The company believes tolerability data from this study indicate that higher doses may be achieved with longer titration windows. Hence, Viking plans to evaluate further dose escalation in the upcoming phase II trial. Based on phase I results, the company plans to initiate a phase I study of VK2735 in patients with obesity in mid-2023.The company has initiated a phase I study to evaluate a novel oral formulation of VK2735.  This study is an extension of the company's recently completed phase I evaluation of subcutaneously administered VK2735 and will evaluate daily oral doses for 28 days.Story continuesBiomea Surges on Study Data:  Shares of the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Biomea Fusion, Inc.  BMEA surged significantly after the company announced initial positive top-line data on BMF-219. Data was announced for the first two cohorts of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) enrolled in the phase II portion of its ongoing phase I/II clinical study (COVALENT-111) of BMF-219.Data showed 89% of patients achieved a reduction in HbA1c, 78% achieved at least a 0.5% reduction in HbA1c and 56% achieved at least a 1% reduction in HbA1c in Cohort 3 after four weeks of once-daily 100 mg dosing with the investigational, oral covalent menin inhibitor. Initial observations of continued glycemic control were seen in follow-up visits in patients that had already reached week eight in the study (four weeks after the last BMF-219 dose). BMF-219 demonstrated a well-tolerated safety profile. No patients on BMF-219 discontinued dosing and all patients completed four weeks of treatment.

To skip the detailed analysis of the SaaS market, go directly to the 5 Biggest SaaS Companies in the World.SaaS refers to a software delivery and licensing method in which software is accessed online via a subscription rather than being bought and installed on individual computers. In our previous report, we stated that the SaaS industry was worth $96 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $235 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 15.9%. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM) are among the top performers in the industry.A key driver of SaaS market growth is the rise of remote work. During the pandemic, nearly 70% of full-time employees worked from home. The new dynamics forced many companies to consider switching to remote work as organizational policy. In fact, an Upwork analysis established that over 60% of the companies surveyed were planning more remote work in the years after the pandemic. As more people work remotely, the demand for SaaS services expands because businesses will need to migrate most of their operations to the cloud.In addition, the SaaS market has plenty of growth opportunities. For example, Gartner predicted in 2020 that 70% of customer interactions would involve SaaS-related technologies like machine learning (ML) applications and chatbots, up from 15% in 2018. This means the AI-powered customer service niche has plenty of room for growth. Other SaaS niches with room for growth are predictive analytics, personalized marketing, cybersecurity, and data management.The SaaS market has several segmentations, each focused on a specific application of the ""as a service"" business model. One of the most popular segments is customer relationship management (CRM). The CRM segment is one of the largest in the SaaS market, with a projected market size of over $60 billion by 2025. It is also one of the fastest-growing segments; Grand View Research projects a CAGR of 14.0% between 2019 and 2025.Story continuesThe human resources (HR) software market is another significant segment of the SaaS market. It is also fast-growing, with a projected market size of over $30 billion by 2028, and it should expand at a 10.10% CAGR from 2021 to 2028. Other segments of the SaaS market include accounting and finance, collaboration and communication, and enterprise resource planning (ERP).15 Biggest SaaS Companies in the WorldPhoto by Hack Capital on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe researched the software services and Cloud industry and picked the biggest SaaS companies in the world based on market cap. The list is ranked in ascending order of market caps as of March 14.15 Biggest SaaS Companies in the World15. Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY)Market capitalization as of March 14: $47.52 billionWorkday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY) is an SaaS company because it delivers its software application over the internet, and customers can access and utilize the software without having to manage the infrastructure or deploy the software on their own. Workday provides enterprise-level cloud-based software solutions for human resources, finance, and business planning. Workday has a large customer base of over 55 million, and they provide services to more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies. In 2022, the company generated revenue of $5.14 billion.14. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP)Market capitalization as of March 14: $55.61 billionShopify is an SaaS company that provides an e-commerce platform for online stores and retail point-of-sale systems. As an SaaS company, Shopify delivers its software application over the internet, and customers can access and use the software without having to manage the infrastructure or deploy the software on their own.Shopify had over 2 million merchants using their platform to create and host online stores in 2022. The number of live websites built using Shopify is twice the number of merchants, indicating that each merchant creates an average of two unique Shopify websites. Several well-known brands, including Pepsi, Tesla, Nestle, and Staples, have Shopify websites, in addition to GymShark, Heinz, Lord &amp; Taylor, and Crate &amp; Barrel.Baron Funds mentioned Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:""Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is a cloud-based software provider for multi-channel commerce. Shares rose 28.6% in the fourth quarter, reversing some of the declines from earlier in the year, as preliminary holiday results suggested a rebound in e-commerce activity. The company also reported solid third quarter financial results showing an increase in take rates, which points to a deeper adoption of its platform by merchants. We remain shareholders due to Shopify's strong competitive positioning, innovative culture, and long runway for growth (it has less than 2% share of global commerce spending).""13. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW)Market capitalization as of March 14: $55.82 billionPalo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) primarily provides advanced security solutions to protect networks, devices, and cloud-based applications against cyber threats. As an SaaS business, the company offers several solutions that provide advanced cybersecurity protection for networks, cloud-based applications, and endpoints. They include: Prisma Access, Prisma Cloud, Cortex XDR, WildFire, and GlobalProtect.In its Q4 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments highlighted a few stocks, and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Stock selection within the IT sector was the main detractor from relative performance during the period. In addition to rate hikes compressing the multiples of longer duration, high growth companies, recession concerns were also a headwind. IT companies which had proven resilient against customer budget reductions earlier in the year are starting to feel the impact of spending slowdowns as companies further scrutinize expenses in light of economic uncertainty. For example, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), which provides enterprise security solutions including next-generation firewalls and threat detection software, faced a challenging environment as customers delayed purchases and orders. However, we remain convinced of the company’s long-term growth prospects as an industry leader in a critical field and as digital attacks and ransomware continue to grow.”12. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Market capitalization as of March 14: $85.91 billionServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is primarily an IT solutions company. The company has offerings in several categories of the IT industry. They include IT Service Management (ITSM) IT Operations Management (ITOM), IT Business Management (ITBM), Security Operations, Customer Service Management, and field service management.ServiceNow, Inc.

In the latest financial results, the company revealed that total revenues grew 22% year-over-year to $1.94 billion. For the full year 2022, the revenue growth was 28% year-over-year. Following the strong financial performance, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg raised his price target on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) to $510 from $500 barely 24 hours after Q4 2022 earnings release. He kept an ‘Outperform’ rating on the shares.Here is what Polen Capital has to say about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an $80 billion market cap business based in California. Its purpose is to make the world of work, work better for people. Getting a job done in an enterprise (what the company refers to as “workflow”) usually requires different people in various functions of an organization to work together. Often, they rely on different technology systems and inefficient manual processes to complete each step of the job before moving on to the next.ServiceNow believes the most effective digital transformation initiative utilizes tools that can integrate workflows across siloed systems, departments, processes, and people. The company is solving what is arguably the biggest pain point in the biggest profit pool in the world (enterprises). Consider the explosion in data growth and all the software point solutions emerging constantly. ServiceNow wrangles all this into a fully integrated dashboard on a global scale with global customers in every industry. Nearly 100% of revenues are subscription based with a 99% renewal rate, and the company currently has no direct competition, according to our research. ServiceNow started with an IT workflow, and today, ~40% of net new annual contract value is in non-IT workflows. Through constant innovation, the business has continued to expand its total addressable market, and we think it can grow free cash flow (FCF) at a 20%+ annualized rate for the next three to five years. At less than 30x FCF, we thought the valuation was attractive.”11. Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP)Market capitalization as of March 14: $89.16 billionAutomatic Data Processing, Inc.

They also reaffirmed their 2025 mid-term financial targets, which means double-digit revenue growth in 2024 and beyond, with midteens earnings growth at the mid-point of their guidance.”6. Adobe Inc.

The Intuit QuickBooks Accountant Technology Survey, which collected responses from 2,000 accountants in the U.S., also explores how firms are adapting to the decline in the talent pipeline while maintaining a positive outlook on the future of the profession.""We know accountants are busier than ever - with 43% reporting they serve more than 40 clients - and increasingly, they're looking to technology to help them be more efficient and better meet client needs,"" said Jeremy Sulzmann, Vice President, Intuit QuickBooks Partners Segment. ""As our most valued partners, we wanted to dig deeper into what macro trends are impacting accountants so we can continue to focus on further developing the technology they need most to grow their businesses. In 2019, Intuit declared its strategy to become an AI-driven expert platform, and we’ve accelerated AI innovation at scale to deliver personalized experiences to more than 100 million consumer and small business customers.""AI and Tech Adoption Spurs Firm GrowthAccountants recognize the impact technology can have on the growth of their firms, and as a result are prioritizing tech investments to move their businesses forward. In fact, 86% of respondents agree that technology will play a significant role in the growth and expansion of their practices in the next year. And in 2023, accountants expect to spend an average of $15,800 on technology improvements and upgrades. Nearly half expect to invest in and adopt automation tools (48%), AI (48%), and blockchain technology (47%) to maximize efficiencies.Story continues""AI has powerful potential, and accountants are hungry to capitalize on what it has to offer,"" Sulzmann explained. ""We see this appetite today with emerging tech, such as generative AI, as accountants look for ways to leverage new technologies that create efficiencies and free up their time to pursue higher-value work and better serve their clients. At QuickBooks, we recognize this demand and build solutions into our platform to provide an AI-driven expert platform that helps accountants and their small business clients operate more efficiently. This includes automating tasks like categorizing transactions using personalized machine-learning models that learn from user preferences and are refreshed daily. We will continue to invest in AI technologies that help experts save time, optimize their value, and fuel more meaningful relationships with their clients.""Early adopters of these technologies say innovative tech is helping drive their businesses forward, with 91% reporting that technology has helped them support their clients’ evolving needs over the past two years. However, some are still wary of the emerging technology’s performance: nearly a third (31%) said a top concern for adopting technology like AI is trusting the solution can ensure accuracy.Business Expected to BoomEven in the face of external factors like inflation, accountants’ outlook for 2023 is positive with 82% sharing that they anticipate growth. More than 60% say clients’ financial needs have increased. Technology is a key contributor to this bullish view, with 41% citing that their increased revenue is a result of technology improvements they previously implemented. Accountants also state that providing better value to their clients, updating workflows, and adding new services are all a result of leveraging technology. Still, accountants say there are areas where they could use technology to help them better serve their clients and grow their businesses. For example, predicting future business performance (38%) and understanding real-time business performance (38%) are among the top areas accountants would like to improve through better use of technology.Satisfaction is High, Talent Pipeline is LowWhile technology adoption is rapidly increasing across the industry, hiring has become a concern for many. Despite 69% reporting they are satisfied with their jobs overall, there is still a gap in young talent entering the industry – sounding some alarms for what the future holds.Accountants cite strong salaries and earning potential as the top reasons to pursue the profession. Additionally, more than eight in 10 accountants (82%) said they would recommend the field to young professionals. Despite this, there is concern about today’s talent pipeline.More than nine in 10 (94%) respondents reported that a dwindling pipeline of young accountants entering the profession is one of the biggest challenges when it comes to talent, and 90% have experienced hiring challenges over the past year, with particular difficulty hiring individuals with more than five years of experience. This in turn creates a focus on succession planning, with 87% of accountants saying planning for their business’s long-term future is a priority.For firms looking not just to recruit but retain talent, mentoring was identified as a key way to create a competitive advantage. Other tactics to retain talent include helping with qualification costs (36%), providing advancement opportunities (36%), and training (36%).Read the Intuit QuickBooks Accountant Technology Survey results here.

229,2cfbf11c-433b-3baf-8f2a-3a8cb4745aa3,DVA,2023-03-30,DaVita (NYSE:DVA) investors are sitting on a loss of 33% if they invested a year ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/davita-nyse-dva-investors-sitting-135146661.html,1680097906,STORY,['DVA'],"[Investors can approximate the average market return by buying an index fund. While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. Unfortunately the DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) share price slid 33% over twelve months. That's well below the market decline of 15%. On the other hand, the stock is actually up 6.5% over three years.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for DaVita In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Unfortunately DaVita reported an EPS drop of 37% for the last year. We note that the 33% share price drop is very close to the EPS drop. Therefore one could posit that the market has not become more concerned about the company, despite the lower EPS. Instead, the change in the share price seems to reduction in earnings per share, alone.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on DaVita's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 15% in the twelve months, DaVita shareholders did even worse, losing 33%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 4% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for DaVita  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit concerning.Story continuesIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

231,5e932900-5c67-3058-91f1-326df8d6e048,VMC,2023-03-30,Avis Budget Group and Vulcan Materials have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avis-budget-group-vulcan-materials-130701599.html,1680095221,STORY,"['CAR', 'VMC', '^GSPC', 'OMER']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – March 29, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Avis Budget Group CAR as the Bull of the Day and Vulcan Materials VMC as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Lantheus LNTH, Omeros OMER and Hyperfine HYPR.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Landing the Bull of the Day is Avis Budget Group which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an overall “A” VGM grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.Avis’s Business-Services Industry is also in the top 6% of over 250 Zacks industries and the company is positioned to benefit from higher travel demand as a leading vehicle rental operator with global locations in North America, Europe, and Australia.  Last year was a record year for Avis in revenue, net income, and adjusted EBITDA with its Avis has beaten earnings expectations for 10 consecutive quarters and topped sales estimates in its last eight quarterly rep2023 outlook looking attractive as well after crushing Q4 top and bottom line expectations last month. orts.Earnings Estimate RevisionsAlthough 2022 will be a very tough year to follow with EPS at $58.05, earnings estimate revisions have continued to trend higher for Avis following its stellar Q4 results.Fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have now gone up 14% over the last 90 days at $28.24 per share and FY24 EPS estimates have soared 32% to $24.31.Good ValueWith earnings estimates on the rise, Avis’s price-to-earnings valuation is very attractive at just 6.3X forward earnings. This is nicely beneath its industry average of 15.7X and the S&amp;P 500’s 18.3X.Even better, Avis stock trades well below its extreme decade-long high of 1,034X and at a 45% discount to the median of 11.5X.Avis’s EV/EBITDA valuation stands out as well at 3.5X and alludes to the company being undervalued but in strong financial health. To that point, Avis’s EV/EBITDA is far below the industry average of 8.6X with the benchmark at 12.1X as a loose comparison.Story continuesBottom LineWhat is most impressive about Avis stock is that shares of CAR have soared over 1,200% in the last three years as the company's growth continued to surprise many. Avis stock is up +8% year-to-date, trading at $177 per share and still 46% off its 52-week highs.With rising earnings estimate revisions, industry dominance, and strong enterprise value, it would not be surprising if Avis stock starts soaring in 2023.Bear of the Day:Vulcan Materials currently lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with its Building Products-Concrete and Aggregates Industry in the bottom 20% of over 250 Zacks industries.There could be more short-term weakness ahead for Vulcan stock as a supplier of construction aggregates and other construction materials such as concrete, asphalt mix, and calcium.Subpar Q4 ReportDuring its most recent fourth quarter report on February 16, Vulcan stated it was impacted by abnormally wet and cold weather that disrupted construction activity and materials shipment in addition to softening in single-family residential demand.Disruption in construction activity led to Vulcan missing its Q4 earnings expectations by -16% at $1.08 per share compared to EPS estimates of $1.29. Vulcan also missed top-line estimates by -5%.Shares of VMC have dropped roughly 9% since its Q4 report and the dip could continue with earnings estimates declining. Fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have now declined 12% over the last 90 days and FY24 EPS estimates have dropped 13%.Subpar ValuationThe declining earnings estimates have made Vulcan’s P/E valuation less attractive. Trading around $168 per share, Vulcan stock trades at 27.9X forward earnings.While this is well below its extreme decade-long highs and a slight discount to the median of 31.6X, shares of VMC trade much higher than the industry average of 11.5X and above the S&amp;P 500’s 18.3X.Furthermore, the company’s EV/EBITDA of 15.9X is noticeably higher than its industry average of 7.6X with many analysts seeing the optimum level at less than 10X.Bottom LineWith Vulcan’s business industry weakening at the moment, justification for paying a premium for VMC shares is fading. To that point, investors may want to be cautious of Vulcan stock right now as the decline after its Q4 report could continue.Additional content:3 Medical Stocks Creating Wealth Despite Macro ChallengesThe broader U.S. indices, reflecting market sentiments, have been reeling under significant pressure in 2022, with companies from the majority of sectors facing several headwinds like a hawkish Fed, geopolitical issues and lingering COVID-19 uncertainties.However, several companies managed to buck the trend and created wealth for their investors, driven by strong fundamentals. Some companies also initiated cost-savings programs along with price hikes to fight the rising cost of materials that benefited their margins.Three stocks — Lantheus, Omeros and Hyperfine — have managed to rise nearly or more than 50% year to date in 2023.All these three stocks have witnessed a strong rally so far this year, significantly beating the S&amp;P 500’s performance. Shares of Lantheus, Omeros and Hyperfine have surged 57.9%, 78.3% and 48.2%, respectively, compared with 4% increase of the S&amp;P 500 Index so far this year. Lantheus sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Omeros and Hyperfine carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating positive revisions in their respective earnings expectations. Let’s take a closer look at each one. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.LantheusLantheus is involved in developing, manufacturing, selling and distributing diagnostic medical imaging agents and products for diagnosing cardiovascular and other diseases. The company reported robust top- and bottom-line growth for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 on the back of its key product, Pylarify — the PSMA PET imaging agent of choice. Strong quarterly results led the company to estimate its revenue and adjusted earnings to be $1.140 billion - $1.160 billion and $4.95 - $5.10 per share, respectively, for 2023. The guidance implies revenue growth of 30% and earnings growth of 19.1% at the mid-point of the guided ranges.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current fiscal year (fiscal 2023) earnings is $4.79, implying a year-over-year improvement of 13.5%.

The FY24 estimates suggest a further 25.3% bottom-line improvement. Estimates for FY23 and FY24 loss have widened in the past 30 days.HyperfineHyperfine is a groundbreaking medical device company, which created Swoop, the first FDA-cleared portable MRI system. The company received multiple FDA clearances and international approvals in the past few months for AI-powered software upgrades to Swoop. It installed 35 commercial systems for full-year 2022. Hyperfine expects full-year revenues for 2023 to be $10 to $14 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current fiscal year (fiscal 2023) loss is 67 cents, implying a year-over-year improvement of 35.6%. Estimates for FY23 earnings improved 30% in the past 30 days.The expected year-over-year revenue uptick for FY23 is 68.8%.Hyperfine delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 25.46%.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

The Dublin-based company will opt for the spin-off if acquisition offers for the assets in the coming weeks do not meet its valuation expectations, the sources said.The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. A Medtronic spokesperson said the company will provide details on the future of the two units ""in due course"" and declined to comment further.ICU Medical, GE Healthcare, Carlyle and CD&amp;R declined to comment. Linden did not respond to requests for comment.Medtronic, the world's largest standalone medical device maker, announced in October it would seek to shed its patient monitoring and respiratory interventions businesses to streamline its portfolio and focus on its higher-growth assets, such as its heart and diabetes devices.The patient monitoring technology portfolio includes Nellcor pulse oximetry and BIS brain monitoring, while the respiratory interventions business comprises ventilators and breathing systems.Story continuesICU Medical, whose market capitalization is just shy of $4 billion, has been on an acquisition spree, most recently buying Pfizer Inc's infusion therapy business and Smith Group Plc's medical division for $1 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.GE Healthcare, which spun out of General Electric Co in January, is a provider of imaging, ultrasound and diagnostics equipment that has a market value of $35 billion.(Reporting by David Carnevali in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis)]"

The company is considered one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up.America’s No. 2 energy firm’s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin. As a reflection of these positives, we saw CVX’s EPS jump 132% in 2022.However, Chevron was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially. The company’s high oil price sensitivity is a concern too. Moreover, the supermajor’s 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% is indicative of its inability to replace the amount of energy produced.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Coca-Cola have gained +8.4% over the past six months against the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry’s gain of +13.3%. The company’s results benefited from the continued momentum in its business. Sales gained from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and a rise in concentrate sales. It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments.It provided an upbeat guidance for 2023. However, shares of Coca-Cola lagged the industry year to date. Pressures from higher supply chain costs, including transportation and input costs hurt gross margin.

Investments in innovation and productivity improvement should fuel the company’s growth. Also, its shareholder-friendly policies are praiseworthy.However, supply-chain disruptions, including labor and material shortages and high logistics costs, are weighing on General Electric’s performance. Raw material cost inflation poses a threat to the company’s bottom-line performance. Weakness in the Renewable Energy segment due to lower volumes is concerning.

The violations caused an excessive release of pollutants like smog-forming volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide.As part of the settlement, Matador will pay $1.15 million in civil penalties to be shared between the EPA and NMED. Besides this, the company will pay $1.25 million in diesel engine replacements and $500,000 for aerial monitoring of the facilities to detect methane leaks and other issues.The company will also pay $800,000 in mitigation costs to offset certain environmental impacts resulting from the violations. The settlement will not only improve air quality for nearby communities but also help limit climate change. It will also ensure that Matador does not profit from its violations of environmental laws.Matador agreed to pay the penalties and make upgrades at its 239 well pads to comply with the federal Clean Air Act and state regulations. The company’s settlement is estimated to reduce emissions by 16,000 tons, with an additional reduction of methane and other greenhouse gas emissions by 31,000 tons. This is equivalent to taking 6,060 gasoline-powered vehicles off the road per year.Headquartered in Dallas, TX, Matador is an independent energy company that explores, develops, produces and acquires oil and natural gas resources in the United States.

As such, the price of the stock isn't as big of a factor as it may have been in the past.Instead, the quality of a company's business, its competitive advantages, and its future earnings growth potential matters far more to a stock price.Buying blue chips with growth potential and competitive advantages is often times better than buying an average stock in the long term as blue chips are generally well known and established companies that are profitable.In terms of growth, some leading technology blue chip stocks have potential future growth potential.Many investors think that artificial intelligence will be the fourth industrial revolution and one that will allow the world to produce substantially more products and services as well as innovative products.

Although no one knows for sure which companies will succeed and which ones won't, the big tech companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the United States that have invested a lot into AI have some advantages. Because it takes a lot of computer processing, existing big tech companies with substantial computer processing capability, data, and financial resources have a advantage in terms of future growth. Some other leading tech companies such as The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) can also play a role in the future with their own niches with licensing for instance.Story continuesBecause AI is so fast changing, some leading tech companies could be left behind if they don't innovate enough even though they are dominating now. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Analysis, finances, workPhoto by Carlos Muza on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 14 Best Affordable Tech Stocks to Buy Now, we chose 14 tech stocks with competitive advantages that trade for around $200 or under.We then ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q4.14 Best Affordable Tech Stocks to Buy Now14.

To skip the detailed analysis of the SaaS market, go directly to the 5 Biggest SaaS Companies in the World.SaaS refers to a software delivery and licensing method in which software is accessed online via a subscription rather than being bought and installed on individual computers. In our previous report, we stated that the SaaS industry was worth $96 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $235 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 15.9%. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), and Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM) are among the top performers in the industry.A key driver of SaaS market growth is the rise of remote work. During the pandemic, nearly 70% of full-time employees worked from home. The new dynamics forced many companies to consider switching to remote work as organizational policy. In fact, an Upwork analysis established that over 60% of the companies surveyed were planning more remote work in the years after the pandemic. As more people work remotely, the demand for SaaS services expands because businesses will need to migrate most of their operations to the cloud.In addition, the SaaS market has plenty of growth opportunities. For example, Gartner predicted in 2020 that 70% of customer interactions would involve SaaS-related technologies like machine learning (ML) applications and chatbots, up from 15% in 2018. This means the AI-powered customer service niche has plenty of room for growth. Other SaaS niches with room for growth are predictive analytics, personalized marketing, cybersecurity, and data management.The SaaS market has several segmentations, each focused on a specific application of the ""as a service"" business model. One of the most popular segments is customer relationship management (CRM). The CRM segment is one of the largest in the SaaS market, with a projected market size of over $60 billion by 2025. It is also one of the fastest-growing segments; Grand View Research projects a CAGR of 14.0% between 2019 and 2025.Story continuesThe human resources (HR) software market is another significant segment of the SaaS market. It is also fast-growing, with a projected market size of over $30 billion by 2028, and it should expand at a 10.10% CAGR from 2021 to 2028. Other segments of the SaaS market include accounting and finance, collaboration and communication, and enterprise resource planning (ERP).15 Biggest SaaS Companies in the WorldPhoto by Hack Capital on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe researched the software services and Cloud industry and picked the biggest SaaS companies in the world based on market cap. The list is ranked in ascending order of market caps as of March 14.15 Biggest SaaS Companies in the World15. Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY)Market capitalization as of March 14: $47.52 billionWorkday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY) is an SaaS company because it delivers its software application over the internet, and customers can access and utilize the software without having to manage the infrastructure or deploy the software on their own. Workday provides enterprise-level cloud-based software solutions for human resources, finance, and business planning. Workday has a large customer base of over 55 million, and they provide services to more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies. In 2022, the company generated revenue of $5.14 billion.14. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP)Market capitalization as of March 14: $55.61 billionShopify is an SaaS company that provides an e-commerce platform for online stores and retail point-of-sale systems. As an SaaS company, Shopify delivers its software application over the internet, and customers can access and use the software without having to manage the infrastructure or deploy the software on their own.Shopify had over 2 million merchants using their platform to create and host online stores in 2022. The number of live websites built using Shopify is twice the number of merchants, indicating that each merchant creates an average of two unique Shopify websites. Several well-known brands, including Pepsi, Tesla, Nestle, and Staples, have Shopify websites, in addition to GymShark, Heinz, Lord &amp; Taylor, and Crate &amp; Barrel.Baron Funds mentioned Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here's what the firm said:""Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is a cloud-based software provider for multi-channel commerce. Shares rose 28.6% in the fourth quarter, reversing some of the declines from earlier in the year, as preliminary holiday results suggested a rebound in e-commerce activity. The company also reported solid third quarter financial results showing an increase in take rates, which points to a deeper adoption of its platform by merchants. We remain shareholders due to Shopify's strong competitive positioning, innovative culture, and long runway for growth (it has less than 2% share of global commerce spending).""13. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW)Market capitalization as of March 14: $55.82 billionPalo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) primarily provides advanced security solutions to protect networks, devices, and cloud-based applications against cyber threats. As an SaaS business, the company offers several solutions that provide advanced cybersecurity protection for networks, cloud-based applications, and endpoints. They include: Prisma Access, Prisma Cloud, Cortex XDR, WildFire, and GlobalProtect.In its Q4 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments highlighted a few stocks, and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Stock selection within the IT sector was the main detractor from relative performance during the period. In addition to rate hikes compressing the multiples of longer duration, high growth companies, recession concerns were also a headwind. IT companies which had proven resilient against customer budget reductions earlier in the year are starting to feel the impact of spending slowdowns as companies further scrutinize expenses in light of economic uncertainty. For example, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), which provides enterprise security solutions including next-generation firewalls and threat detection software, faced a challenging environment as customers delayed purchases and orders. However, we remain convinced of the company’s long-term growth prospects as an industry leader in a critical field and as digital attacks and ransomware continue to grow.”12. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Market capitalization as of March 14: $85.91 billionServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is primarily an IT solutions company. The company has offerings in several categories of the IT industry. They include IT Service Management (ITSM) IT Operations Management (ITOM), IT Business Management (ITBM), Security Operations, Customer Service Management, and field service management.ServiceNow, Inc.

In the latest financial results, the company revealed that total revenues grew 22% year-over-year to $1.94 billion. For the full year 2022, the revenue growth was 28% year-over-year. Following the strong financial performance, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg raised his price target on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) to $510 from $500 barely 24 hours after Q4 2022 earnings release. He kept an ‘Outperform’ rating on the shares.Here is what Polen Capital has to say about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is an $80 billion market cap business based in California. Its purpose is to make the world of work, work better for people. Getting a job done in an enterprise (what the company refers to as “workflow”) usually requires different people in various functions of an organization to work together. Often, they rely on different technology systems and inefficient manual processes to complete each step of the job before moving on to the next.ServiceNow believes the most effective digital transformation initiative utilizes tools that can integrate workflows across siloed systems, departments, processes, and people. The company is solving what is arguably the biggest pain point in the biggest profit pool in the world (enterprises). Consider the explosion in data growth and all the software point solutions emerging constantly. ServiceNow wrangles all this into a fully integrated dashboard on a global scale with global customers in every industry. Nearly 100% of revenues are subscription based with a 99% renewal rate, and the company currently has no direct competition, according to our research. ServiceNow started with an IT workflow, and today, ~40% of net new annual contract value is in non-IT workflows. Through constant innovation, the business has continued to expand its total addressable market, and we think it can grow free cash flow (FCF) at a 20%+ annualized rate for the next three to five years. At less than 30x FCF, we thought the valuation was attractive.”11. Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP)Market capitalization as of March 14: $89.16 billionAutomatic Data Processing, Inc.

They also reaffirmed their 2025 mid-term financial targets, which means double-digit revenue growth in 2024 and beyond, with midteens earnings growth at the mid-point of their guidance.”6. Adobe Inc.

In the past month, the Dow has lost 0.80%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have added 0.03% and 2.27%.The Consumer Price Index rose 0.4% in February and 6% from a year ago, mostly due to persistently higher rent followed by food and energy prices. Responding to the current scenario, the Fed, in its recent policy meeting, increased key interest rates by 25 basis points to meet its obligation against its inflation expectation of 2% in the long run.With this, the Fed has increased its benchmark overnight interest rate since last March by 475 basis points from the near-zero level to the current 4.75-5.00% range, the highest in 15 years.The banking collapse in the United States, which started with the Silicon Valley Bank, followed by Signature Bank and later on Credit Suisse, turned out to be the biggest since the financial crisis in 2008. The federal government had to step in to ensure depositors’ interest. The question now is whether the Fed has overstepped with its aggressive rate hike stances.The U.S. baking crisis has been felt beyond Wall Street in the United Kingdom, Europe and China. Also, the global energy crisis and supply-chain challenges remain major threats to business.Thus, investors looking for regular income and capital preservation can invest in mature businesses, which pay out regular dividends. Amid adverse economic conditions, these stocks remain profitable due to their proven business models.Companies, which tend to reward investors with a high dividend payout, outperform non-dividend-paying stocks during market volatility. Investors can expect a regular flow of income in volatile market conditions.On that note, let us look at companies like Oxford Industries OXM, BRP DOOO, MidAmerica Apartment Communities MAA, and SL Green Realty SLG, which have lately hiked their dividend payouts.Oxford Industries is an apparel company.

(AAL) shares had an impressive run over the past six months. The stock has gained 14.1% compared with an 11.8% rise in the industry it belongs to.Reasons for the UpsideContinued recovery in air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, bodes well for American Airlines.  In the fourth quarter of 2022, passenger revenues, accounting for the bulk of the top line (92%), increased to $12,131 million from $8,382 million a year ago.Driven by soaring demand on healthy bookings, in the March quarter, total revenues per available seat miles are expected to be 24-27% higher than the first-quarter 2022 actuals.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe carrier's debt-reduction efforts are impressive as well. Management aims to reduce its debt by $15 billion by 2025-end. The company aims to attain this objective through naturally occurring amortization.

247,3178ead7-53f0-309f-8006-04fdf3dd1cec,AAL,2023-03-30,American Airlines Will Offer Its New Fares in Sabre From April 3,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-offer-fares-sabre-130000355.html,1680094800,STORY,"['AAL', 'SABR']","[Adding the NDC content is an American Airlines is going live with its New Distribution Capability offers with global distribution system Sabre on April 3, marking the point of no return for its removal of 40 percent of its airfares from traditional retail channels.The announcement on Wednesday of Sabre’s upcoming integration will be a blow to BCD Travel, the large global corporate travel agency that earlier this week warned that “NDC isn’t quite there yet – and won’t be by April 1.” It’s also likely to disappoint the American Society of Travel Advisors, which had called for a nine-month postponement.Starting on April 3, Sabre said connected travel buyers, agencies and developer partner customers will be able to shop, book and service American Airlines’ New Distribution Capability content, including paid seats, through Sabre’s Offer and Order APIs, the agency point-of-sale tool, Sabre Red 360, and its GetThere booking tool, the Texas-based technology company said.Fares include the carrier’s Main Select and Flagship Business Plus, ancillary products and the lowest fares available in these channels. Sabre also said customers will have access to more descriptive information on American’s flight offers as well as seat selection enabled in the booking path.With Amadeus and Travelport already primed, Sabre’s inclusion means the world’s biggest airline isn’t backing down. Experts now warn there will be now challenges as some business travelers may be locked out from the new fares.Going ‘Off-System’There are concerns not all corporate travel agencies, or online booking tools that a company employee uses to access company approved flights, are fully connected to American Airlines New Distribution Capability content.American is expected to shift most of its cheapest fares to direct channels, including its own website —  which may mean “price sensitive” companies will prefer to book this way.Tracking software Traxo predicts a higher rate of out-of-system bookings in 2023. It argues increased choice and personalized offers from New Distribution Capability solutions are proving ever more tempting for business travelers to book via off-platform, direct channels.Story continues“The impending American Airline deadline poses real risks for the corporate travel sector as a material percentage of AA’s New Distribution Capability rates are anticipated to only be bookable directly via the airline or other NDC-ready travel intermediaries, both of which are typically outside of approved corporate channels,” said Andres Fabris, Traxo CEO and founder.BCD said it had been working diligently to prepare its clients’ travel programs for this switch, but said the reality is that no one can offer a seamless customer solution by the April deadline.“Ultimately corporate travellers don’t really care that the right content isn’t there, they will book whatever is available in the tool that their company is pushing them to use,” Steve Domin, CEO and co-founder of airfare aggregator Duffel. “Corporate travel managers and chief financial officers might feel a little differently about this obviously, as they’ll want to control spend, and not having access to any negotiated fares they have is going to hurt.”Steve Reynolds, CEO of auditing and rebooking platform TripBam, believes the next four to eight weeks will be challenging.“Some (employees) aren’t all that really cost sensitive, so are they really going to care? I’m paying $500 for a round-trip, I guess that’s just what the price is. Am I really going to search hard to find something a lot cheaper? Probably not,” he said.“However you will have some that are price sensitive that will see on AA.com that it’s cheaper. It’s hard for a travel manager to say ‘no, don’t book it, I want you to book through your online booking tool.”Meanwhile, rivals Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are expected to gain, whatever the outcome. If American Airlines’ clients aren’t happy with the outcome, they may well prefer to work with rival carriers. Yet if the transition is smooth, other airlines may well decide to accelerate their own transition, knowing that agencies and booking tools have the infrastructure to cope.“While it is still early days for New Distribution Capability bookings, making this rich New Distribution Capability content from the world’s largest airline available in Sabre channels is an important step towards the maturing and scaling of NDC distribution,” said Kathy Morgan, vice president, NDC and airline supply, Sabre Travel Solutions.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

""The best part of it all is seeing the excitement of the kids, which inspires us to compete and bring our best game to the tournament. This is only possible because of the endless support we receive from the city of Des Moines, Principal, and the Wakonda Club.""Wakonda Club's sustainability initiatives In addition to Principal Charity Classic's sustainability initiatives, the Wakonda Club will undergo renovations to its course to enhance safety, experience, and sustainability practices including: installation of a new irrigation system designed for water efficiency and conservation, as well as introducing a new strand of grass that is more drought-tolerant; planting 170 trees throughout the course to replace those which were unstable, lost in weather events or removed during course improvements; and creating more native areas to reduce the need for routine watering and maintenance.""Sustainability and conservation are important to Wakonda Club members as well,"" said John Ruan IV, Wakonda Club Board president. ""So as our superintendent and Greens Committee work on plans with the course architect and contractors, we try to incorporate safety and sustainability in every aspect of the renovation.""

Shares have lost about 7.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Universal Health Services due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Universal Health Q4 Earnings Beat on Solid SegmentsUniversal Health reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.02, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2%. Additionally, the bottom line grew 2.4% year over year.The quarterly results of UHS were aided by improved patient volumes at its acute care and behavioral health care facilities. However, the upside was partly offset by an elevated expense level related to salaries, wages and benefits, which might have cropped up from the shortage of nurses and other medical personnel throughout the United States.Quarterly Operational UpdateNet revenues of Universal Health advanced 5.2% year over year to $3,447 million in the quarter under review.  The top line beat the consensus mark by 1.3%.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation &amp; amortization (EBITDA), net of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (NCI), amounted to $471.7 million.

(NYSE:NRG) was covered in the 2019 letter with VST. We sold the shares as COVID induced volatility presented better risk/reward opportunities, but never subsequently repurchased shares—as we did with VST. Not only do we think VST is a better value, but the management team at NRG appears to have gone astray. Despite coming to his position during an activist campaign by Elliott Management in 2017, when the prior empire-building CEO was shown the door, the replacement CEO has seemingly embarked on the same failed strategy. In early December they announced the purchase of Vivint Smart Home, a smart home platform company, for $2.8 billion. The transaction diversifies NRG’s business, increases leverage, dramatically reduces intermediate-term shareholder capital returns, and most importantly, is the opposite of what management told us they were going to do when they assumed the role in 2017. The stock fell 15% on the day of the announcement and is down another 5% since then, and now 10% lower than when we first wrote about it. We like the generation business at NRG and the valuation is almost back to interesting, but we’d probably have to see turnover in the C-suite and a refreshed corporate strategy to reignite our enthusiasm.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Utility Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:11 Best Communication Stocks to Buy10 Best Used Car Stocks to Buy15 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure: None. 16 Best Utility Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Among these, Viking Therapeutics, Inc.  VKTX soared on obesity data, while Incyte INCY suffered a setback for ruxolitinib extended-release (XR) tablets.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories:Viking Soars on Study Results:  Viking Therapeutics announced positive results from the phase I single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) clinical study of VK2735 for obesity. VK2735 is a novel dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors in development for the potential treatment of various metabolic disorders.VK2735 demonstrated promising safety and tolerability, as well as a predictable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in the SAD portion of the study. Following single subcutaneous doses, VK2735 demonstrated a half-life of 170 to 250 hours, a Tmax (time to reach maximum plasma concentration) ranging from 75 to 90 hours, and excellent therapeutic exposures. VK2735 demonstrated encouraging tolerability and positive signs of clinical activity in the MAD portion of the study. All cohorts receiving VK2735 showed reductions in mean body weight from baseline, ranging up to 7.8%. Cohorts receiving VK2735 also demonstrated reductions in mean body weight relative to placebo, ranging up to 6.0%Data also showed statistically significant differences compared to placebo were maintained or improved at the day 43 follow-up time point, 21 days after the last dose of VK2735 was administered. The company believes tolerability data from this study indicate that higher doses may be achieved with longer titration windows. Hence, Viking plans to evaluate further dose escalation in the upcoming phase II trial. Based on phase I results, the company plans to initiate a phase I study of VK2735 in patients with obesity in mid-2023.The company has initiated a phase I study to evaluate a novel oral formulation of VK2735.  This study is an extension of the company's recently completed phase I evaluation of subcutaneously administered VK2735 and will evaluate daily oral doses for 28 days.Story continuesBiomea Surges on Study Data:  Shares of the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Biomea Fusion, Inc.  BMEA surged significantly after the company announced initial positive top-line data on BMF-219. Data was announced for the first two cohorts of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) enrolled in the phase II portion of its ongoing phase I/II clinical study (COVALENT-111) of BMF-219.Data showed 89% of patients achieved a reduction in HbA1c, 78% achieved at least a 0.5% reduction in HbA1c and 56% achieved at least a 1% reduction in HbA1c in Cohort 3 after four weeks of once-daily 100 mg dosing with the investigational, oral covalent menin inhibitor. Initial observations of continued glycemic control were seen in follow-up visits in patients that had already reached week eight in the study (four weeks after the last BMF-219 dose). BMF-219 demonstrated a well-tolerated safety profile. No patients on BMF-219 discontinued dosing and all patients completed four weeks of treatment. Biomea continues dose escalation of BMF-219 in COVALENT-111 and plans to explore additional dosing periods greater than four weeks to evaluate the optimal duration of glycemic control.Biomea currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Intra-Cellular Soars on Depression Drug Data:  Shares of Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. ITCI announced positive top-line results from study 403 evaluating lumateperone 42mg as monotherapy in the treatment of major depressive episodes in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) with mixed features and patients with bipolar depression with mixed features.Lumateperone 42mg was statistically significant on the primary endpoint of symptom reduction on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) for each patient population. Lumateperone 42mg was statistically significant on the key secondary endpoint of the clinician’s assessment of improvement in the overall severity on the Global Impression of Severity Scale (CGI-S) compared to placebo at week six in the combined patient population of MDD with mixed features and bipolar depression with mixed features, patients with MDD with mixed features and patients with bipolar depression with mixed features.Lumateperone is already approved under the brand name Caplyta for the for the treatment of schizophrenia and depressive episodes associated with bipolar I or II disorder (bipolar depression) as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate.Incyte Suffers Setback:  Incyte INCY announced that the FDA has issued a complete response letter (CRL) for ruxolitinib extended-release (XR) tablets, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, for once-daily (QD) use in the treatment of certain types of myelofibrosis (MF), polycythemia vera (PV) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The CRL indicates that the FDA cannot approve the application in its present form as even though the study submitted in the new drug application (NDA) met its objective of bioequivalence based on area under the curve (AUC) parameters, it identified additional requirements for approval. Hence, the company will meet the FDA to determine the next steps.Ruxolitinib is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of PV in adults who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea; intermediate or high-risk MF, including primary MF, post-polycythemia vera MF and post-essential thrombocythemia MF in adults; steroid-refractory acute GVHD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older; and chronic GVHD after the failure of one or two lines of systemic therapy in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older.Updates From Regeneron: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. REGN announced that the European Commission (EC) approved a label expansion of Libtayo (cemiplimab) in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with ≥1% PD-L1 expression. The approval includes patients with no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 aberrations and whose tumors are metastatic or locally advanced and not candidates for definitive chemoradiation.Regeneron also announced a collaboration with Sonoma Biotherapeutics, Inc. to apply their scientific and clinical expertise and respective technology platforms to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel regulatory T-cell therapies for autoimmune diseases.Performance Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has gained 0.68% in the past five trading sessions.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after investigating Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Quest Diagnostics is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.14 = US$1.6b ÷ (US$13b - US$1.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, Quest Diagnostics has an ROCE of 14%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Healthcare industry average of 9.4% it's much better. View our latest analysis for Quest Diagnostics roceIn the above chart we have measured Quest Diagnostics' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsOver the past five years, Quest Diagnostics' ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So unless we see a substantial change at Quest Diagnostics in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger.The Key TakeawayIn summary, Quest Diagnostics isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 54% over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.Story continuesOn a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for Quest Diagnostics  that we think you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

258,91535d72-ecee-30a4-8b13-2c571e7a909c,DGX,2023-03-30,Quest Diagnostics (DGX) Upgraded to Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-dgx-upgraded-buy-160004215.html,1680105604,STORY,['DGX'],"[Quest Diagnostics (DGX) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Quest Diagnostics basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Quest Diagnostics imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Quest DiagnosticsFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this medical laboratory operator is expected to earn $8.68 per share, which is a change of -12.8% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Quest Diagnostics. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2.6%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Quest Diagnostics to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
