One insurance segment is life insurance, which protects families from financial difficulties in case a key member passes away. This industry is one of the largest in the world, according to research from Research Reports World. The firm estimates that the global life insurance sector was worth a whopping $2.8 trillion in 2021, and from then until 2027, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.99% to sit an estimated $3.75 trillion.Today's piece will focus on the largest American life insurance providers, and some of the top firms in it are MetLife, Inc.

The stock market has cheered on his comments, providing nice relief for investors.Powell acknowledged the idea of smaller interest rate hikes potentially starting in December and reiterated that the Fed remains laser-focused on bringing inflation down.Further, Powell said that the Fed is likely to need somewhat higher rates in 2023 than the initial projections in September provided.While inflation obviously remains too high for the Fed’s liking, Powell’s relatively less-hawkish nature was a welcome sight by investors, boosting the major indices well into the green intraday.With the Fed fully committed to bringing inflation down, stocks in the financial sector, such as insurers, may see their profit margins expand in higher interest-rate environments.To back their policies, insurers primarily carry safe long-term bonds, allowing them to generate more money from their debt as interest rates rise.Three insurers – Aflac AFL, Unum Group UNM, and Reinsurance Group of America RGA – could all be considerations for investors during a higher interest-rate regime.Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs we can see, all three stocks reside well in the green year-to-date, becoming bright spots in an otherwise dim market. Let’s take a closer look at each one.AflacAflac is an American insurance company and a massive supplier of supplemental insurance within the U.S.For those that seek income, Aflac has that covered; the company’s annual dividend currently yields 2.2%, just a tick below its Zacks Finance sector average of 2.3%.Further, the company has shown a commitment to growing its dividend, upping its payout six times over the last five years, translating to a 10.8% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesCurrently, AFL shares trade at a 13.5X forward earnings multiple, above the 11.2X five-year median but below its Zacks sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAFL carries a Value Style Score of a B.Unum Group Unum Group provides disability insurance, long-term care insurance, life insurance, and employee-paid group benefits and related services.The company has witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions over the last several months, helping land the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSimilar to AFL, Unum Group pays its investors handsomely; the company’s annual dividend currently yields 3.2% paired with a 6.3% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.UNM pays out 23% of its earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchReinsurance Group of America Reinsurance Group of America is a leading global provider of traditional life and health reinsurance and financial solutions with operations in the United States, Canada, Europe, and others.RGA carries a loaded growth profile, with earnings forecasted to soar more than a quad-digit 1200% in its current fiscal year (FY22) and a further 3.4% in FY23.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue upticks of 3.8% in FY22 and 2.9% in FY23, indicating that margins are expanding quite notably.Further, shares are relatively cheap; the company’s shares currently trade at a 9.5X forward P/E ratio, well beneath the 12.1X five-year median and Zacks Finance sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRGA has found success within its quarterly results as of late, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by at least 76% in its last three quarters.Sales results paint a similarly positive story; RGA has exceeded sales expectations in eight consecutive quarters. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineA somewhat less-hawkish stance from the Fed gave stocks a significant boost in today’s session.Of course, it’s essential to know that the Fed is still fully committed to bringing inflation down, but the talk of potentially slower-paced rate hikes was a welcome sight by investors.During higher interest rate environments, companies such as – Aflac AFL, Unum Group UNM, and Reinsurance Group of America RGA – can see their profit margins expand.Additionally, the Zacks Finance sector is currently ranked #1 out of all 16 Zacks sectors, telling us that stocks within have been witnessing favorable earnings estimate revisions.After all, since a sector is nothing more than a group of stocks in a similar business, utilizing the Zacks Sector Rank is the perfect way to see which areas currently look more promising than others.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

DINO, Unum Group UNM, G-III Apparel Group. GIII and Sterling Infrastructure STRL.5 Valuable Price-to-Book Stocks in the SpotlightWhile price-to-earnings and price-to-sales are the first to cross one's mind while using valuation metrics, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also a convenient valuation metric.The P/B ratio measures how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of the book value of a stock. It determines whether a company's asset value is comparable to the stock's market price or not and hence can be useful for finding value stocksIt is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Celestica, HF Sinclair Corp., Unum Group, G-III Apparel Group. and Sterling Infrastructure are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What's Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company's balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders' equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company's balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock's price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S, and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our five picks out of the 9 stocks that qualified the screening: Celestica is one of the largest electronics manufacturing services companies in the world, serving the computer and communications sectors.Celestica has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of A.

We’re on to the next, we have an important quarter to finish.”In the meantime, he said “everything stays the same” at Tommy and Calvin. “The big changes are the  other company has to find the people to do what he’s planning on executing.”PVH CEO Stefan Larsson is taking full control of the Tommy and Calvin businesses to push forward his brand-centric PVH+ strategic plan.Goldfarb said the change was no “amazing amount of challenge.”“We’ve done our job of building brands, taking on situations that others couldn’t achieve and profiting through it,” he said.Last year, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger made up 50.7 percent of G-III’s net sales.DKNY is one of G-III’s growth brands.Luckily for G-III, Goldfarb has been expanding in other areas and this year consolidated control of the Karl Lagerfeld brand, giving it a promising European luxe base alongside Vilebrequin, acquired in 2012, and Sonia Rykiel, acquired in 2021.G-III also owns the DKNY brand.“We’re at the early stage of all our assets,” Goldfarb said. “There’s plenty of organic growth, there’s plenty of opportunities to supplement them.”Story continuesHe said there was a “compelling case” that G-III could make more money than it planned by focusing on other businesses.“We enjoyed our relationship with PVH, it was certainly prosperous,” Goldfarb said. “We’re committed to a smooth transition for both companies, the relationships are in place, the intent is to evolve the business as times goes on into the hands of PVH, if they still want it when the term is done.“There’s nothing pressing,” Goldfarb said. “We’re financially sound, we’ve got a little work to do operationally that doesn’t relate to this. Our greater disappointment is how we managed the quarter in terms of inventory receipts and processing the inventory through our facilities.”That’s a hiccup Goldfarb swore would not happen again.For the third quarter, G-III’s net income fell to $61.1 million from $106.7 million a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.35 — 46 cents below the $1.81 analysts projected. Revenues for the three months ended Oct. 31 increased to $1.08 billion from $1.02 billion.Inventories at the end of the quarter rose to $901 million from $449 million. Goldfarb in the statement said: “Our higher inventory levels are due to our accelerated production calendar, which was in anticipation of longer supply chain lead times. Our inventory is comprised of current purchases and guided by our order book. During the quarter, the higher inventory levels caused logistical challenges within our distribution centers. This resulted in significant onetime charges in the third quarter, that were above our expectations, which adversely impacted our bottom line by approximately 40 cents per diluted share. For the fourth quarter of fiscal-year 2023, our order book is strong and we are well positioned to meet the demand of our retailers for the holiday season.”]"

It is also prompting PVH to transition away from its long-standing licensing relationship arrangement with G-III Apparel Group.More from WWDTommy Hilfiger RTW Spring 2023Front Row at Tommy Hilfiger RTW Fall 2022Scenes from Decentraland's Metaverse Fashion WeekPVH has extended most of its licensing deals with G-III for Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger wholesale women’s apparel in the U.S. and Canada in order to bring the businesses in house in an orderly fashion. The licensing deals now expire by 2027.Larsson said the businesses make up about one third of global licensing revenues, which last year tallied $340 million, but less than 10 percent of the company’s earnings before interest and taxes.The CEO said he was grateful for G-III’s work on the brands, but wanted his hands on the reins to get the most out of the full scope of both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein.“Over time, being in complete control and leveraging the best of our brand — in product design, assortment, building pricing, channel mix, supply chain — it’s a critical component to deliver on the PVH+ commitment,” Larsson said.Taking the businesses in house would also strengthen PVH’s relationship with retailers who sell the company’s men’s apparel or underwear.“Wholesale is very important to us; it’s very important to the consumer,” Larsson said. “We have very strong relationships with Macy’s and other key partners and it’s about getting close and unlocking the full power of your brand.”Larsson laid out his PVH+ plan in April, targeting the company for $12.5 billion in revenues by 2025, up from $9.2 billion last year.A look from Tommy Hilfiger.It’s a brand-centric, digitally led approach that has PVH focusing on hero products, consumer engagement, online, a demand- and data-driven operating model and driving efficiencies.Story continuesThe CEO said that approach has left the brand in good stead so far and that the demand-driven model would get another boost this week when H&amp;M veteran David Savman joins as executive vice president and chief supply chain officer.Larsson is refashioning PVH at a time of intense upheaval in fashion — not only did he take charge from his predecessor Manny Chirico during the pandemic, he has been pushing his plan through supply chain disruptions, inflation, a spike in interest rates and the threat of recession.That general turmoil in the market was certainly reflected in the company’s third-quarter net results.PVH’s bottom line took a $417 million pretax non-cash hit from a writedown in goodwill tied to a significant increase in discount rates, which are used in accounting to determine the present value of future cash flows. That led to a net loss of $186.7 million in the quarter, down from earnings of $279.7 million a year earlier.But adjusted earnings per share — the number Wall Street obsesses over — came in at $2.60, 45 cents ahead of the $2.15 analysts had penciled in.Revenues for the quarter ended Oct. 30 fell 2.2 percent to $2.28 billion from $2.33 billion a year earlier, which would have been an increase of 7 percent in constant currencies. Tommy Hilfiger’s revenues decreased 4 percent on a reported basis and rose 7 percent in constant currencies, while Calvin Klein was up 1 percent on a reported basis and 9 percent in constant currencies.“We delivered a strong quarter despite the challenging macro [environment],” Larsson said, adding the business grew in all regions and both brands, adjusting for currency. “The way we drive the quarter, I feel really good about. We just focused intently on what’s within our control and executing the PVH+ growth drivers and the consumer responded. So we’re gaining traction.”Larsson said PVH had a strong August and September and then, like other fashion companies, saw consumers weaken in October — and he expects that weakness to continue into the fourth quarter.“Just like in Q3, we anticipate the consumer sentiment, the macro backdrop to be challenging, but we showed in Q3 that we could compete in and win in spite of that,” he said.PVH boosted its full-year earnings outlook to $8.25 a share, up from the $8 previously forecast, reflecting strength in the third quarter.]"

[NYSE: PVH] today reported its 2022 third quarter results and updated its full year outlook.Stefan Larsson, Chief Executive Officer, commented, ""We are pleased with our third quarter results as we delivered high single-digit constant currency top-line growth. This was ahead of our expectations, despite having to navigate continuing macroeconomic headwinds. Our strong performance reflects the power of our two global iconic brands, Calvin Klein and TOMMY HILFIGER, and the pricing power we are able to achieve by delivering strong hero product, engaging closely with consumers, and elevating the customer experience. Our international businesses continued to execute well across both brands, even as macro conditions remain challenging in Europe and COVID impacts continued in Asia. In North America, we are encouraged by the positive performance indicators we are seeing, especially how consumers are responding to and engaging with our brands, although we recognize that we are in the early stages of a multi-year journey to unlock this region’s full opportunity.""Story continuesMr. Larsson added, ""Through the PVH+ Plan, we seek to tap into our full potential by focusing on our core strengths and connecting our iconic brands closer to where the consumer is going than any time before. Our goal is to win with the consumer and achieve long-term profitable growth.""Zac Coughlin, Chief Financial Officer, said, ""We continue to manage our business in a prudent and disciplined manner, and delivered on the commitments we made by relentlessly focusing on improving execution and reducing costs. We are doubling down on the PVH+ Plan growth drivers and focusing on what is within our control to drive sustainable growth, generate strong cash flows, and deliver shareholder returns.""Non-GAAP Amounts:Amounts stated to be on a non-GAAP basis exclude the items that are defined or described in greater detail near the end of this release under the heading ""Non-GAAP Exclusions."" Amounts stated on a constant currency basis also are deemed to be on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of amounts on a GAAP basis to amounts on a non-GAAP basis are presented after the Non-GAAP Exclusions section and identify and quantify all excluded items. References to the Company’s underlying revenue growth refers to the revenue change on a constant currency basis, excluding the impacts of the war in Ukraine, the Heritage Brands transaction and the exit from the Heritage Brands retail business, as applicable.Third Quarter Review:Revenue decreased 2% compared to the prior year period (increased 7% on a constant currency basis), inclusive of a 2% reduction resulting from the impact of the war in Ukraine, including closures of Company stores in Russia, the cessation of wholesale shipments to Russia and Belarus, and a reduction in wholesale shipments to Ukraine.The Company’s underlying high single-digit revenue growth compared to the prior year period was driven by growth across all regions and in both its Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brand businesses. The increase included solid performance in the Company’s international businesses, as well as improvements in North America, particularly in the direct-to-consumer business, despite the challenging global macroeconomic environment.Direct-to-Consumer revenue decreased 5% compared to the prior year period (increased 5% on a constant currency basis).Wholesale revenue decreased 2% compared to the prior year period (increased 9% on a constant currency basis).Total Digital revenue decreased 12% compared to the prior year period (decreased 1% on a constant currency basis). Total Digital includes the sales through the Company’s digital commerce businesses and sales to the digital businesses of its traditional and pure play wholesale customers reflected in the Direct-to-Consumer and Wholesale revenues above. Digital penetration as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 20%.Gross Margin was 55.9% as compared to 57.7% in the prior year period, as the benefit from price increases was more than offset by higher costs, increased promotional activity and the negative impact of approximately 40 basis points of foreign currency translation.Inventory increased 32% compared to the prior year period due to a combination of (i) abnormally low inventory levels in all regions in the prior year period, (ii) a planned increase in core product to mitigate supply chain and logistics disruptions, and (iii) elevated inventory levels in the North America wholesale business due to lower than expected demand.Third Quarter Consolidated Results:Revenue decreased 2% to $2.281 billion compared to the prior year period (increased 7% on a constant currency basis), inclusive of a 2% reduction resulting from the impact of the war in Ukraine.Tommy Hilfiger revenue decreased 4% compared to the prior year period (increased 7% on a constant currency basis)Tommy Hilfiger International revenue decreased 10% (increased 5% on a constant currency basis)Tommy Hilfiger North America revenue increased 12%Calvin Klein revenue increased 1% compared to the prior year period (increased 9% on a constant currency basis)Calvin Klein International revenue decreased 4% (increased 9% on a constant currency basis)Calvin Klein North America revenue increased 9%Heritage Brands revenue decreased 4% compared to the prior year period.Earnings (loss) before interest and taxes (""EBIT"") on a GAAP basis was $(214) million, inclusive of a $30 million negative impact due to foreign currency translation, compared to $377 million in the prior year period. Included in the third quarter was a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $417 million, which was non-operational and driven by a significant increase in discount rates, and included in the prior year period was a net gain of $113 million recorded in connection with the Heritage Brands transaction. EBIT on a GAAP basis for these periods also include other amounts for the applicable period described under the heading ""Non-GAAP Exclusions"" later in this release. EBIT on a non-GAAP basis for these periods exclude these amounts.EBIT on a non-GAAP basis was $220 million, inclusive of a $30 million negative impact due to foreign currency translation, compared to $266 million in the prior year period. The revenue growth on a constant currency basis was more than offset by the gross margin decline discussed above. The Company continues to take a disciplined approach to managing expenses, driving cost efficiencies while making targeted investments to drive its strategic initiatives.Earnings (loss) per share (""EPS"")GAAP basis: $(2.88) compared to $3.89 in the prior year period.Non-GAAP basis: $2.60 compared to $2.67 in the prior year period.EPS on both a GAAP basis and non-GAAP basis for the third quarter included the negative impacts of (i) $0.35 per share related to foreign currency translation and (ii) $0.18 per share related to the war in Ukraine.EPS on a GAAP basis for these periods also included the amounts for the applicable period described under the heading ""Non-GAAP Exclusions"" later in this release, including the $417 million pre-tax noncash goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter and the $113 million pre-tax net gain recorded in connection with the Heritage Brands transaction in the prior year period. EPS on a non-GAAP basis for these periods exclude these amounts.Interest expense decreased to $19 million from $25 million in the prior year period.Effective tax rate was 19.8% on a GAAP basis as compared to 20.7% in the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 15.7% on a non-GAAP basis compared to 20.5% in the prior year period.Stock Repurchase Program:Delivering on its commitment under the PVH+ Plan to return excess cash to stockholders, the Company repurchased 1.9 million shares of its common stock for $102 million during the third quarter of 2022.2022 Outlook:Full Year 2022 GuidanceRevenue is projected to be at the top end of previous guidance range, a decrease of approximately 3% as compared to 2021 (increase approximately 4% on a constant currency basis), inclusive of a 4% negative impact related to (i) a 2% reduction resulting from the Heritage Brands transaction and exit from the Heritage Brands Retail business and (ii) a 2% reduction resulting from the impact of the war in Ukraine.EPSGAAP basis: projected to be approximately $1.37 compared to $13.25 in 2021.Non-GAAP basis: projected to be approximately $8.25 compared to $10.15 in 2021.The 2022 EPS projections on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis include the estimated negative impacts of (i) approximately $1.15 per share related to foreign currency translation and (ii) approximately $0.60 per share related to the Company’s businesses in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine that have been significantly affected in the current year by the war in Ukraine, apart from the one-time noncash asset impairments recorded in the second quarter in connection with the Company’s decision to exit from its Russia business discussed under the heading ""Non-GAAP Exclusions"" later in this release.EPS on a GAAP basis for these periods also include the other amounts for the applicable period described under the heading ""Non-GAAP Exclusions"" later in this release. EPS on a non-GAAP basis excludes the one-time noncash asset impairments recorded in the second quarter discussed above and these other amounts.Interest expense is projected to decrease to approximately $85 million compared to $104 million in 2021 primarily due to the impact of voluntary debt repayments made in 2021.Effective tax rate is projected to increase as compared to 2021 and be approximately 64% on a GAAP basis and approximately 24% on a non-GAAP basis. The 2022 effective tax rate guidance on a GAAP basis reflects the impact of the $417 million pre-tax noncash goodwill impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of 2022, which is non-deductible for tax purposes. The 2022 effective tax rate guidance on a non-GAAP basis excludes this impact.Fourth Quarter 2022 GuidanceRevenue is projected to decrease approximately 4% as compared to the prior year period (increase approximately 4% on a constant currency basis), including a 2% reduction resulting from the impact of the war in Ukraine.EPSGAAP basis: projected to be approximately $0.45 compared to $5.53 in the prior year period.Non-GAAP basis: projected to be approximately $1.65 compared to $2.84 in the prior year period.The fourth quarter 2022 EPS projections on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis include the estimated negative impacts of (i) approximately $0.27 per share related to foreign currency translation and (ii) approximately $0.15 per share related to the Company’s businesses in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine that have been significantly affected in the current year by the war in Ukraine.The fourth quarter 2022 EPS projection on a GAAP basis also includes an unfavorable tax impact related to the $417 million pre-tax noncash goodwill impairment charge, as the impairment is non-deductible and has been factored into the Company’s annualized effective tax rate. EPS on a GAAP basis for the prior year period included the amounts described under the heading ""Non-GAAP Exclusions"" later in this release. EPS on a non-GAAP basis exclude these amounts.Interest expense is projected to be flat compared to $24 million in the prior year period.Effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 80% on a GAAP basis and 25% on a non-GAAP basis. The fourth quarter 2022 tax rate guidance on a GAAP basis includes the impact resulting from the $417 million pre-tax noncash goodwill impairment charge as discussed above. The fourth quarter 2022 effective tax rate guidance on a non-GAAP basis excludes this impact.Please see the section entitled ""Full Year and Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts"" at the end of this release for further detail and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts discussed in this section.Non-GAAP Exclusions:The discussions in this release that refer to non-GAAP amounts exclude the following:Pre-tax noncash goodwill impairment charge of $417 million recorded in the third quarter of 2022, which was non-operational and driven by a significant increase in discount rates.Pre-tax costs of $17 million incurred in the third quarter of 2022, consisting of severance related to initial actions under the plans announced in August 2022 to reduce people costs in the Company’s global offices by approximately 10% by the end of 2023.Pre-tax charges of $50 million recorded in the second quarter of 2022 in connection with the Company’s decision to exit from its Russia business, primarily consisting of noncash asset impairments.Pre-tax gain of $16 million recorded in the second quarter of 2022 in connection with the sale of the Company’s equity investment in Karl Lagerfeld Holding B.V.Pre-tax gain of $49 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the recognized actuarial gain on retirement plans.One-time discrete tax benefits of $152 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021 principally resulting from a tax accounting method change made in conjunction with the Company’s 2020 U.S. federal income tax return.Pre-tax net gain of $113 million recorded in the third quarter of 2021 in connection with the sale of certain intellectual property and other assets of the Company’s Heritage Brands business that closed on the first day of the third quarter of 2021 (the ""Heritage Brands transaction""), which includes a gain on the sale, less costs to sell, a net gain on the Company’s retirement plans associated with the transaction, and severance costs.Pre-tax costs of $48 million incurred in 2021 in connection with actions announced in March 2021 to streamline the Company’s organization through reductions in its workforce, primarily in certain international markets, and to reduce its real estate footprint, including reductions in office space and select store closures, consisting of noncash asset impairments, severance, and contract termination and other costs, of which $43 million was incurred in the first quarter, $2 million was incurred in the second quarter, and $2 million was incurred in the third quarter.Pre-tax costs of $21 million incurred in 2021 in connection with the exit from the Heritage Brands Retail business announced in July 2020 that was substantially completed in the second quarter of 2021, consisting of severance and other termination benefits, accelerated amortization of lease assets and contract termination and other costs, of which $8 million was incurred in the first quarter and $13 million was incurred in the second quarter.Estimated tax effects associated with the above pre-tax items, which are based on the Company’s assessment of deductibility. In making this assessment, the Company evaluated each item that it had identified above as a non-GAAP exclusion to determine if such item was (i) taxable or tax deductible, in which case the tax effect was taken at the applicable income tax rate in the local jurisdiction, or (ii) non-taxable or non-deductible, in which case the Company assumed no tax effect.As a supplement to the Company’s GAAP results, the Company presents constant currency revenue information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company presents results in this manner because it is a global company that transacts business in multiple currencies and reports financial information in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by the Company in U.S. dollars with respect to its foreign revenues. Exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on reported revenues. The Company believes presenting constant currency revenue information provides useful information to investors, as it provides information to assess how its businesses performed excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance.The Company calculates constant currency revenue information by translating its foreign revenues for the relevant period into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior year period (rather than at the actual exchange rates in effect during the relevant period).Constant currency performance should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or as superior to, the Company’s operating performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. The constant currency revenue information presented may not be comparable to similarly described measures reported by other companies.Please see Tables 1 through 7 and the sections entitled ""Reconciliations of 2022 Constant Currency Revenue"" and ""Full Year and Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts"" later in this release for reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts.Conference Call Information:The Company will host a conference call to discuss its third quarter earnings release on Thursday, December 1, 2022 at 9:00 a.m. EST.

(the ""Karl Lagerfeld transaction""); (iii) the noncash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2022, which was non-operational and driven by a significant increase in discount rates; (iv) the costs incurred in the third quarter of 2022 related to initial actions taken under the plans announced in August 2022 to reduce people costs in the Company’s global offices by approximately 10% by the end of 2023, (the ""2022 cost savings initiative""), consisting of severance; (v) the costs incurred in the first, second and third quarters of 2021 in connection with actions announced in March 2021 to streamline the Company’s organization through reductions in its workforce, primarily in certain international markets, and to reduce its real estate footprint, including reductions in office space and select store closures, consisting of noncash asset impairments, severance, and contract termination and other costs; (vi) the costs incurred in the first and second quarters of 2021 related to exiting the Heritage Brands Retail business, consisting of severance and other termination benefits, accelerated amortization of lease assets, and contract termination and other costs; (vii) the gain recorded in the third quarter of 2021 in connection with the sale of certain intellectual property and other assets of the Company’s Heritage Brands business that closed on the first day of the third quarter of 2021 (the ""Heritage Brands transaction""), which includes a gain on the sale, less costs to sell, and a net gain on the Company’s retirement plans associated with the transaction; (viii) the costs incurred in the third quarter of 2021 in connection with the Heritage Brands transaction, consisting of severance; and (ix) the tax effects associated with the foregoing pre-tax items. The Company excludes these amounts because it deems them to be non-recurring or non-operational and believes that their exclusion (i) facilitates comparing the results being reported against past and future results by eliminating amounts that it believes are not comparable between periods, thereby permitting management to evaluate performance and investors to make decisions based on the ongoing operations of the Company, and (ii) assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. The Company believes that investors often look at ongoing operations of an enterprise as a measure of assessing performance. The Company uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s Board of Directors and others. The Company’s results excluding the items described above are also the basis for certain incentive compensation calculations. The non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, the Company’s operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The information presented on a non-GAAP basis may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.PVH CORP.Non-GAAP Measures (continued)(In millions, except per share data)The following table presents the non-GAAP measures that are discussed in this release.

Each stock was up 1% in the quarter compared to the 16% price decline for the S&amp;P 500 and the positions were reduced as the valuations became somewhat less appealing, though still attractive enough to warrant inclusion.”14. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is a New York-based multinational investment bank and financial services company that provides related services to its consumers. In November, JPMorgan raised its price target on the stock to $49.50 with a Neutral rating on the shares. The firm mentioned that large-cap banks will benefit largely from rising interest rates and benign credit quality.In Q3 2022, Citigroup Inc.

The company's cash position for the quarter remained strong for the quarter, as it generated $9 billion in free cash flow.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Shares of Citigroup declined in the quarter as investors became increasingly negative on capital markets activity. The company is also continuing to divest certain consumer banking geographies which may be dilutive to earnings in the near term.”13. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is a California-based business software company that mainly deals in financial software. In fiscal Q1 2023, the company posted revenue of $2.6 billion, which showed a 29.4% growth from the prior-year period. The company had a total cash and investments balance of approximately $2.7 billion at the end of the quarter. It also repurchased shares worth over $3 billion, which shows its strong cash position.In November, Credit Suisse initiated its coverage of Intuit Inc.

(NASDAQ:INTU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We took advantage of its 2022 price decline to add a small position in Intuit. INTU is a leading SaaS software solutions provider to small businesses, consumers, and professional accountants, best known for its QuickBooks accounting and TurboTax tax preparation platforms. INTU recently strengthened its personal finance offerings with the acquisitions of Mint and Credit Karma, and its small business offering with the acquisition of email marketing platform Mailchimp. The company is benefitting from the secular shift to digitization for both businesses and consumers. Given its vast amount of valuable personal finance and tax customer data from its 100 million + customer installed base, the company can apply artificial intelligence to the data to generate actionable intelligence for customers, as well as a large cross-selling opportunity across its products.Given INTU’s less than 5% penetration of its $300 billion market, we believe the company can grow its top-line mid-teens, while improving its high-margin business model of greater than 80% gross margins and greater than 35% EBITDA margin, leading to high-teens EPS growth for the foreseeable future. At about 2% of revenue, the company also requires limited capital expenditures, producing significant and growing FCF, which INTU has used for acquisitions, a small dividend, debt repayment and stock buybacks.”12. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an American multinational software and tech company. In November, Needham lifted its price target on the stock to $200 with a Buy rating on the shares, appreciating the company's solid quarterly earnings.

Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is a Washington-based diversified company that specializes in medical, industrial, and commercial products and also provides related services. The company is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as it has been raising its dividends consistently for the past eight years. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.39%, as of November 29.In November, Barclays maintained an Overweight rating on Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) with a $277 price target, appreciating the company's strong results.Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) reported revenue of $7.66 billion, up 6% from the same period last year.

Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake in the company in Q3.Cooper Investments mentioned Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Spin-offs have been a valuable source of uncorrelated return for the portfolio since inception, whether investing in them directly or retaining ownership stakes in the spun-off assets of existing holdings. During the quarter Danaher announced the spin of its Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions group (EAS) expected to close in late 2023. Danaher have been masters of the spin over the last decade and once again this one appears to make sense for both parties. The parent becomes a pure-play life sciences and diagnostics business with higher growth, margins and returns plus more M&amp;A firepower. EAS, with leading positions in water quality through assets like Hach, ChemTreat and Trojan will, as a standalone business, have a more focused M&amp;A strategy and represent an attractive water-related exposure for ESG focused funds. The spinco will still operate with the highly regarded Danaher Business System though (like ‘Fortive Business System’) we expect this to get rebranded while still delivering outstanding financial results.”10. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a Georgia-based multinational home improvement company that sells tools and related construction products. Truist held a Buy rating on the stock in November with a $382 price target.

(NYSE:HD), up from 80 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $5.6 billion.Diamond Hill Capital mentioned The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) shares were more resilient in Q3 as the company continues to perform well and reiterated guidance despite increasing market concerns regarding general inflationary pressures and the impact rising mortgage rates may have on the housing market. We view the longterm prospects and multi-year fundamental outlook as unchanged. Home improvement through repair and remodel is likely to be one of more resilient housing-related industries given the relative attractiveness for consumers to renovate existing homes rather than reset their current low fixed mortgage rate to higher rates that we’re seeing today.”9. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is an American company that specializes in financial information and analytics. The company's cash position remained strong this year. In the first nine months, it generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow.

(NYSE:SPGI) to $393 with an Outperform rating, highlighting the company's overall performance this year.As of the close of Q3 2022, 90 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), compared with 84 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of $6.2 billion. Among these hedge funds, TCI Fund Management was the company's largest stakeholder in Q3.Baron Funds mentioned S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Shares of rating agency and data provider S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) fell 9% during the third quarter due to continued weak debt issuance activity and headwinds to the Indices business from equity market declines. Credit markets were exceptionally soft during the quarter with non-financial corporate bond issuance down 36% for investment grade and down 84% for high yield, reflecting greater investor risk aversion, rising interest rates, and a drop-off in M&amp;A activity. We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year. Over the long term, the company should continue benefiting from the secular trends of increasing bond issuance, growth in passive investing, and demand for data and analytics, while enjoying meaningful and durable competitive advantages that, in our view, are only strengthening following the merger with IHS Markit.”8. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is an American supplier of scientific instrumentation and also provides related software services.

(NYSE:TMO), with a total value of over $6.8 billion.Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC mentioned Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is considered one of the world’s leaders in serving science. The company makes and distributes analytical instruments, scientific equipment, consumables and other laboratory supplies. Thermo Fisher Scientific operates in four segments: Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Product and Biopharma Services. We see Thermo Fisher Scientific as one of the leading management teams in our coverage both through solid execution and savvy Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A). The company is a diversified provider of research and discovery instruments, tools, consumables, and services, and offers a broad-based play on the increased Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) spend from the biopharma industry.

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is an American multinational financial services holding company. In November, Citigroup maintained a Neutral rating on the stock with a $40 price target, highlighting the company's efficient capital returns over the years.Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) holds a nine-year track record of consistent dividend growth, which places it as one of the best dividend stocks on our list. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share for a dividend yield of 2.38%, as of November 29.As of the close of Q3 2022, 97 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned investments in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), worth over $35.6 billion collectively. Berkshire Hathaway was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.Here is what Artisan Partners said about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We made only one new purchase during the quarter, initiating a position in Bank of America (BAC). As one of America’s largest banks, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is second only to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in size and is probably its closest peer. Both are well-run banks, but compared to JPM, since the GFC, BAC has retired more shares, grown EPS faster and currently has more capital and a lower dividend payout. We are attracted to BAC’s strong capital base, high capital generation capacity, large loan loss reserve, low (~50%) loan/deposit ratio, short duration investment securities book, and low dividend payout that provides financial flexibility. BAC has a less volatile earnings stream than JPM with lower capital market sensitive exposures. Additionally, BAC is rigorously stress tested by the Fed every year in quantitative and qualitative fashion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which we hold in the portfolio, owns 12% of BAC. He petitioned the Fed to own more than 10%, so he clearly likes it. Bank stocks were strong gainers in 2021 on the prospects of higher rates boosting net interest margins, but the stocks pulled back in the first half of 2022 on economic concerns. We believe BAC has massive scale advantages, should benefit from increasing interest rates, particularly in the 2-year part of the yield curve, and should grow over time with the economy. The economic environment is highly uncertain, but current consensus includes the provision for losses more than doubling and capital markets activity slowing. Against that backdrop, our purchase price equated to about 8.5X our estimates of “mid-cycle” earnings. With leading businesses, a double-digit ROE, a prudent capital return strategy and a strong balance sheet, we believe this entry point offers a solid long-term value.”6. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is an American multinational investment bank and financial services holding company. The company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past seven years, coming through as one of the best dividend stocks on our list.

26,17396d79-faff-39b5-bfb6-7a9ebb6b6692,WMT,2022-12-01,How Walmart plans on reducing a gigaton of emissions by 2030,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-plans-reducing-gigaton-emissions-200500510.html,1669838700,STORY,['WMT'],"[Most emissions within the retail sector come from product supply chains rather than stores and distribution centers. In that case, [hotlink]Walmart[/hotlink] locations aren’t directly making a massive impact.However, to mitigate its role as the largest retailer in the world, Walmart launched Project Gigaton to reduce or avoid one billion, or a gigaton, of metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from its product supply chains by 2030.This ambitious goal engages its suppliers in climate action that aligns with the Paris Agreement’s original 2-degree Celsius warming scenario. If achieved, the reduction would represent a substantial decrease of Scope 3 emissions within Walmart’s and its suppliers’ value chains across six critical areas: [hotlink]energy[/hotlink] use, agriculture and forests, waste, packaging, transportation, and product use and design. The project aligns with the company’s vision to become more regenerative.“That means regenerating the resources we rely on for our business to operate our business. And that’s people and planet,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, executive vice president and chief sustainability officer of Walmart, while speaking Fortune's Impact Initiative summit in Atlanta on Wednesday. “So, how do we replenish, restore, renew? That means elevating people and the resources we use as a retailer for the products we make, source, and supply to our customers.”In 2016, Walmart was working on energy efficiency and renewable energy with Environmental Defense Fund, World Wildlife Fund, and CDP. The company struggled to precisely pinpoint its impact beyond its own operations, but realized as a retailer, the toll was huge. They then aimed to involve its suppliers by creating practical, feasible, and compelling action items to decarbonize the most concentrated emission sources in its supply chains.So, depending on the supplier’s category, different action items would be identified within the six critical areas. “They could take energy efficiency in a factory by converting to renewable energy, reducing food waste upstream with farmers, changing packaging, reducing packaging, designing laundry detergent to be used with cold water instead of hot water,” she said, highlighting Proctor &amp; Gamble’s innovation on the latter. From there, they used algorithms to help manufacturers better understand their impact and eventual cost savings overtime if they made environmentally efficient transitions.Story continuesProviding an outline became a huge intervention because it allowed small suppliers as well as big ones to swiftly act. “We wanted to democratize climate action, drive innovation, get emissions down to zero across all categories, but focus the action where it matters and make it really easy for people to do,” McLaughlin noted. Walmart then created workshops to educate and support these companies to build business cases for change.Joining Project Gigaton isn’t a requirement for suppliers, but 4,500 of Walmart’s suppliers currently participate. That’s 70% of its business. Soon, new numbers will be released, which McLaughlin says are even higher.For organizations wanting to spearhead similar initiatives, McLaughlin encourages them to first identify its core mission then what’s most relevant to the business in regards to ESG: environmental issues, social issues, and governance.“Start with those and set it up in a way that you have concrete measurable steps early on,” she said emphasizing going back to the core mission, ensuring it aligns with the stakeholders and company values, and knowing that capabilities are in place to make a difference. “You will have the long-term target, yes, we need that. But, what can you do immediately? Start with the things that are creative and do the innovation to expand that aperture and make more and more of an impact over time.”Of the gigaton by 2030, Walmart is at 57% of its goal. And while it’s on track to achieve a gigaton, Walmart doesn’t plan on stopping when it hits the target.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:  The American middle class is at the end of an era Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire ‘was run by a gang of kids in the Bahamas’ who all dated each other The 5 most common mistakes lottery winners make Sick with a new Omicron variant?

If you want to see more of the top stocks to buy in different sectors, go directly to Top 5 Stocks to Buy in 10 Different Sectors.Diversification when done correctly can improve a portfolio as it can help smooth out the bumps that happen during challenging investment environments.If one company or one sector faces headwinds, for example, owning leading stocks in many different sectors can potentially reduce a portfolio's volatility. As a result, diversification when done correctly can help reduce sector and company specific risk.Diversification does not reduce systemic risk and there will always be risks that diversification will not be able to remove. If the market crashes, many stocks in many different sectors will decline.Generally, however, many investors believe in the power of diversification. Many quantitative hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies own holdings in thousands of different stocks.In terms of diversification, there are many different types including diversification through asset class. A classic example is where an investor invests 60% in leading equities and 40% in leading bonds. Another example of diversification is by diversifying through industry sector. By owning leading shares in all the sectors, a bad performance in one sector might not affect a portfolio all that much.DiversificationFinding the best diversified stocks can be challenging as most stocks operate in only one industry. Although there are conglomerates that own various businesses in different sectors, there are few leading conglomerates out there.Instead, the best diversified stocks are arguably very popular leading ETFs such as the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (VOO). For many investors, finding the best diversified stocks would be to own an ETF like the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (VOO) which includes all 500 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index automatically. The Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (VOO) would also be considered as a contender for ranking among the best diversified stocks given its low costs and its large AUM.Story continuesFor hedge funds trying to find the best diversified stocks, the institutions often purchase individual stocks across multiple different sectors. To find the best diversified stocks, some funds try to buy leading blue chip stocks across all the different sectors. For more on hedge funds, check out 15 Biggest Hedge Funds in the World by AUM if you are interested.Owning blue chips can also help a portfolio. Blue chips are leading companies with substantial competitive advantages. They often have long histories of profitability and returning capital back to shareholders either through dividends or share repurchases.2022 has been a challenging year for the markets as high inflation has caused the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates six times this year. Given the interest rate increases, many stocks have declined as the rising rates have softened demand for many companies. With potentially more interest rates in the future, economists think there could be a recession next year. As a result, there could be more downside if economic data fails to meet expectations.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list, we used FINVIZ.com's categorization of different sectors in the S&amp;P 500 and we picked leading companies from those sectors.We then ranked the companies based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q3 2022.Because we used FINVIZ.com's categorization, stocks such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) that can be categorized as tech sector stocks make it to our list as leading stocks in different sectors.Top 10 Stocks to Buy in 10 Different Sectors10. Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK)FINVIZ.com Sector: UtilitiesNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is one of the largest energy utilities in the United States that is held by 33 of the 920 hedge funds we track in our database at the end of Q3 2022. In terms of its businesses, Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) has an electric utility that serves 8.2 million costumers and a natural gas business that serves 1.6 million customers. Given the rise in interest rates this year, many utility stocks have declined given that their dividends have become less attractive to some investors given rising Treasury yields. Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is no exception as its shares are down 5.36% year to date. Nevertheless, the company has a wide moat and numerous competitive advantages.Alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is a top stock that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of Q3 2022.9. Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI)FINVIZ.com Sector: Real EstateNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) is a leading shared communications infrastructure REIT that ranks as a top stock in the real estate sector. As of 2022, Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) has over 40,000 towers, around 85,000 route miles of fibers, and around 5,000 employees. Given new advancements like 5G and edge computing, demand for Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI)'s real estate could remain strong. In the third quarter, Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) reported site rental revenues of $1.568 billion, up 8% year over year. AFFO per share was $1.85 for the period, up 5% year over year.8. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)FINVIZ.com Sector: IndustrialsNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 53Given the increasing budget of the U.S. military as well as the company's substantial moat, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) ranks as a top stock in the industrials sector. With its year to date rally of 36.6%, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) also ranks among the best performing industrials stocks.Vltava Fund commented on Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT. LMT has a strong and long-term sustainable competitive advantage ensuing from the fact that its products are developed and manufactured at an extremely high level of technology and complexity, its development and contract cycles are measured in decades, and the costs for the government to switch to alternative suppliers are high. Moreover, part of the production is classified as secret, which further takes the wind out of the sails of potential competitors. This results in a very high return on capital and admittedly a slowly but steadily growing business.7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)FINVIZ.com Sector: Consumer DefensiveNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) ranks as a top stock in the consumer defensive sector given the leading retailer's scale and competitive advantages. With inflation higher than before, demand for Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)'s low prices has helped the company grow. In FY23 Q3, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)'s total revenues rose 8.7% year over year to $152.8 billion. Wal-Mart U.S. Q3 comparable sales rose 8.2% year over year and the company continued to gain market share in grocery. The retailing giant's U.S. e-commerce business also grew 16% year over year.6. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)FINVIZ.com Sector: EnergyNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) ranks among the top stocks in the energy sector given the company's scale and profits. With the Russian Ukraine war, energy prices have increased substantially and many of the leading energy companies including Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) have reported substantial profits. If energy prices decline, however, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)'s profits might not be as strong and the sector could underperform.Like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Alphabet Inc.

If you want to see more of the best defensive stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Defensive Stocks to Buy Now.Defensive stocks are stocks that generate relatively stable performances regardless of the market cycle. Defensive stocks generally don't fall as much as the overall market in recessionary times and they might not do as well as the market in more expansionary times. Examples of defensive stocks are leading consumer staples that produce or sell necessities that are in demand throughout the market cycle. Other defensive stocks have very wide moats and substantial competitive advantages that allow them to largely maintain their financial performance during recessions.Given their relatively stable performances, many defensive stocks pay dividends that are pretty consistent. Many of the same defensive stocks have also raised their annual dividends for many consecutive years. If interested also check out 12 Best Consumer Staple Stocks.It should be noted that defensive stocks may not always remain defensive stocks because industries and company management constantly change. If an industry undergoes secular decline, defensive stocks can underperform. Similarly if a formerly defensive company's management decided to overpay for an acquisition, the stock might not do well either.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.2022 has been a challenging year in the market as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times to fight inflation. Although October's core inflation data has shown some positive signs that inflation could be peaking, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard recently said he thought interest rates might need to rise to 5% or higher and stay there until into 2024 before the U.S. central bank can begin to normalize its monetary policy again.Story continuesGiven the interest rate increases and the expected economic slowdown in 2023, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 17.5% year to date and the NASDAQ has declined 30.6% year to date.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Defensive Stocks to Buy Now, we took 12 stocks that have defensive qualities that have outperformed the S&amp;P 500's decline of 17.5% year to date in 2022.We then ranked the 12 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q3 2022.12 Best Defensive Stocks to Buy Now12.

As loads of sales-boosting events — Halloween, Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas — fall in this timeframe, the sector generally sees a sales boost.Investors are more watchful about the retail sector’s performance this year as inflationary pressure is rife, this may weigh on consumers’ buying spree. However, strong job and income growth, excess savings and available credit are tailwinds for the retail sector. The third-quarter Employment Cost Index from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which measures wages and salaries, was up 5% year over year, NRF noted.Holiday Spending DecentAs a result, holiday spending is expected to be healthy even with recent inflationary challenges, as NRF forecasts that holiday retail sales during November and December will increase between 6% and 8% over 2021 to between $942.6 billion and $960.4 billion.Adobe Analytics indicated that $5.29 billion was spent online on Thanksgiving Thursday, up 2.9% year over year, and ahead of the $5.1 billion Adobe initially said it was expecting for the day. Adobe also said that online sales for Black Friday are expected to top $9 billion, a record for the industry while Cyber Monday is expected to garner $11.2 billion. NRF said that 60% of holiday shoppers started browsing and buying by early November.Travel Industry UpbeatTravel during the upcoming holiday season is expected to rebound greatly despite high inflation. After two years of travel bans, restrictions and lockdowns, Americans are set to hit the road. Thanksgiving and Christmas are normally two of the most traveled holidays in the fourth quarter.According to Hopper's 2022 Holiday Travel Outlook released in September, the average price of a domestic plane ticket is $463 for Christmas travel. Christmas airfares are currently averaging 31% higher than 2019, and 39% higher than last year (read: Time to Buy Leisure &amp; Travel ETFs?).Story continuesWhich Retail Stock &amp; ETF to Bet On?Walmart WMT grabbed the top spot among shoppers who are searching online for Black Friday discounts, according to data from Captify, quoted on CNBC.

Edo measures TV ads through search engine volume, which the company says quantifies consumer ad engagement minutes after an ad goes on the air.“As a result of inflation, major retailers including Target, Walmart, Macy’s and Kohl’s have been rethinking their holiday ad campaign strategies and have been pushing out fewer ads than years prior,” an Edo spokesperson said, adding that the move “seems to be working out in their favor.”More from WWDSpring 2023: A Whirlwind Fashion Week in New YorkA Look Inside Destree's First StoreBackstage at Macy's Herald SquareIn its analysis, Edo said the estimated expenditures for the Walmart and Kohl’s holiday campaigns were down 29 percent and 39 percent, respectively, compared to holiday campaign spending at this time last year. Yet, engagement was up.Edo said Kohl’s and Walmart holiday ads “have been over 10 percent more likely to drive search for the brands compared to their non-holiday-themed ads, driving more engagement per person with their holiday campaigns compared to a year ago.”Edo then noted that despite a 17 percent decline in holiday campaign spending at Macy’s, “holiday ads have generated 12 percent more searches for the brand this year compared to the same time last year.” Edo said viewers were also 10 percent more engaged with Macy’s holiday ads this year than a year ago.Edo said the greater holiday campaign impact with lower overall spending “is a result of strong creative decisions — the most-aired holiday creative for Macy’s this year, ‘Give Love, Give Style’ (an extra 30 percent off), was 51 percent more engaging than the brand’s average [fourth-quarter] 2022 creative.”Edo also noted campaigns from Target that began earlier, well before Black Friday, boosted consumer engagement.]"

The cost of a whole chicken was $1.86 a pound, while boneless chicken breast went for $4.67 a pound. Ham was listed as going for $4.43 a pound.By comparison, a two-pound box of Beyond Meat Inc (NASDAQ:BYND) burger patties is selling for $14.80 on Walmart Inc's (NYSE:WMT) website, or $7.40 a pound, while a one-pound package of ground beef is selling for $4.58.A 10-ounce package of Beyond Meat chicken nuggets is selling for $4.98 on Walmart.com, (or around $7.91 a pound), while a two-pound bag of frozen Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) chicken nuggets is selling for $6.98.A whole Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) dinner ham was quoted at $34.35, or $4.58 a pound, on Walmart’s website.Barclays cut its ratings on both Beyond Meat and Tyson this week, saying “the worst is yet to come” as consumers shift their purchasing habits in favor of less expensive proteins and other food.It cut Beyond Meat to underweight from equal weight and moved its price target to $10 from $13. It cut Tyson shares to underweight from equal weight as well, lowering the price target to $58 from $89. Earlier this month, Goldman reiterated a sell rating on Beyond Meat, with a $5 price target.Shares of Beyond Meat were up 12.9% on Wednesday but are down 77% for the year, while Tyson shares rose 0.5% and are down 24% this year. Shares of Hormel fell 2.5% on Wednesday and are down 3.7% this year.Hormel reported earnings on Wednesday, beating profit expectations. But its outlook on net sales came in slightly lower than expected. Hormel forecast net sales for 2023 to be in a range of $12.6 billion to $12.9B, which would be higher than 2022 but below the analyst consensus forecast of $13.1B.Story continuesHigher pricing helped lift profits from its Jennie-O turkey stores.

The residential REIT has also been making concerted efforts to expand its footprint in Denver, Atlanta and Austin.The recent migration trends of affluent renters, who are opting for suburban locations, have made EQR diversify its portfolio and increase its reach to the suburban markets. Its efforts to capture the renter demand in these markets are likely to pay off well.Equity Residential’s portfolio-rebalancing efforts and robust development pipeline seem encouraging for long-term growth.In September 2022, Equity Residential and Toll Brothers, through the Toll Brothers Apartment Living rental division, unveiled plans to develop three luxury rental communities, comprising 1,053 units in the Dallas/Ft. Worth metropolitan area.In third-quarter 2022, it began construction on Lyle, a 334-unit apartment property in Dallas, TX, and entered a joint venture on Remy, a 357-unit apartment property in Frisco, TX, the construction of which commenced in first-quarter 2022.Equity Residential is also banking on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation, rent growth and improve the efficiency of its operating platform. This is likely to provide the company with a competitive edge over others.On the balance-sheet front, the company had $2.3 billion in available liquidity as of Sep 30, 2022. Its limited near-term debt maturities and solid credit metrics poise it well to capitalize on growth opportunities.EQR has been consistent in paying dividends to its shareholders, which remains a huge attraction for REIT investors. In March 2022, the residential REIT increased its quarterly cash dividend on its common stock to 62.50 cents per share from 60.30 cents paid out earlier, marking a hike of 3.7% on its annualized dividend. Considering its robust balance sheet position and a recovery in business, the company is likely to maintain its dividend payout in the forthcoming quarters.Nonetheless, the continuation of the flexible working environment has resulted in lower renter demand for costlier and urban/infill markets, raising concerns for Equity Residential’s properties that are concentrated in the urban markets. Also, management anticipates rent growth to moderate in the upcoming period.Shortage of raw materials and skilled labor amid a high inflationary environment could adversely impact the company’s huge development pipeline.Further, rising interest rates are likely to increase the company's borrowing costs, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.Shares of Equity Residential, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (hold), have lost 5.4% compared with its industry’s decline of 1% in the quarter-to-date period.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies from the REIT sector are VICI Properties VICI, Lamar Advertising LAMR and Equity Commonwealth EQC.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for VICI Properties’ current-year FFO per share is pegged at $1.91.

Humans have been conducting trade since the old ages, and with trade comes the risk of losing out in case of a bad deal. Some of the earliest examples of insulation against such deals come from the time of Hammurabi, the sixth king of the Old Babylonian Empire. Hammurabi's famous codex mandated that shippers only pay the principal of their loan to a creditor if their consignment was lost due to a natural disaster.Since then, the insurance industry has evolved and now uses complex mathematical and statistical models to determine what an individual must pay and what policies to offer. One insurance segment is life insurance, which protects families from financial difficulties in case a key member passes away. This industry is one of the largest in the world, according to research from Research Reports World. The firm estimates that the global life insurance sector was worth a whopping $2.8 trillion in 2021, and from then until 2027, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.99% to sit an estimated $3.75 trillion.Today's piece will focus on the largest American life insurance providers, and some of the top firms in it are MetLife, Inc.

(NYSE:MET) A High Quality Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/based-roe-metlife-inc-nyse-110106285.html,1669892466,STORY,"['MET', 'MET-PE']","[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for MetLife How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for MetLife is:9.6% = US$2.4b ÷ US$25b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.10 in profit.Does MetLife Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, MetLife has a lower ROE than the average (13%) in the Insurance industry.roeThat certainly isn't ideal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. To know the 2 risks we have identified for MetLife visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining MetLife's Debt And Its 9.6% Return On EquityIt seems that MetLife uses a huge volume of debt to fund the business, since it has an extremely high debt to equity ratio of 4.11. The combination of a rather low ROE and high debt to equity is a negative, in our book.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

By virtue of the partnership, Jingle Pay can enjoy a widespread reach of more than 90 million merchants worldwide forming a part of the Mastercard network.Mastercard will back Jingle Pay in rolling out physical and virtual cards to help UAE residents engage in hassle-free daily transactions. There is no compulsion to hold a bank account for availing these cards.Thereby, the latest partnership seems to be of great use to natives of the UAE as they can now use Jingle Pay to conduct secure and seamless digital payments across a global network, rather than merely using the app for engaging in worldwide remittances.The recent move reinforces Mastercard’s sincere efforts to solidify its footprint as a leading technology provider of innovative and secure payment solutions across the UAE. MA tends to leverage its innovative digital capabilities in capturing the promising growth prospects of the country.Per the Mastercard New Payments Index, over 66% of UAE users increased the usage of a minimum of one digital payment method in 2021.  The UAE continues to witness a flourishing digital economy, attributable to increased Internet usage, the presence of a significant young population and higher usage of smartphones.A booming digital economy might have prompted Mastercard to resort to continuous collaborations with an eye on occupying a major share of the digital payments market of the UAE. Thereby, MA has frequently taken the help of fintech to complement its endeavor.Also, Jingle Pay, the app integrated with advanced features, caters to unbanked communities throughout the UAE. As a result, Mastercard seems to be prudent to pick Jingle Pay as its partner since both share the common endeavor of bringing underserved communities within the digital economy, which has no signs of slowing down. Roughly 1.7 million people continue to be unbanked in the UAE, per the UAE Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Authority. This further substantiates the timeliness of the latest alliance.Story continuesShares of Mastercard have gained 12% in a year against the industry’s decline of 9.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMastercard currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  Some better-ranked stocks in the Business Services space are ExlService Holdings, Inc.

The cities of Guangzhou and Chongqing announced an easing of COVID curbs on Wednesday.Brent crude was up 90 cents, or 1%, at $87.87 a barrel by 1:05 pm EDT (1805 GMT). U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures added $1.50, or 1.9%, to $82.05.""Oil markets are going to continue to be buffeted by ongoing news out of China, given how much of an impact ongoing lockdowns are having on oil demand in the world's second-largest consumer,"" said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler.The dollar index slumped to its lowest since August after the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said rate hikes could slow this month. A weaker dollar makes oil cheaper for other currency holders.Crude prices were also supported by hopes of another potential output cut from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies, a group known as OPEC+, which meets on Dec. 4.On Wednesday, sources called a policy change unlikely, but some feel a further cut cannot be ruled out.""I believe the OPEC+ meeting forces shorts to cover, but the consensus is unchanged quota levels,"" said Tamas Varga, of oil broker PVM.Both oil benchmarks are on target for their first weekly gains after three consecutive weeks of decline. Brent touched $80.61 Monday, lowest since Jan. 4.The prospect of a lower price cap on Russian oil is also lending support, analysts said. European Union governments tentatively agreed on Thursday on a $60 cap on Russian sea-borne oil, an EU diplomat said.""After dipping into the mid-$70s at the start of the week, oil is now shifting focus to the OPEC meeting on Sunday, Russian sanctions, and the absence of large SPR barrels hitting commercial inventories - all three of these are price supportive,"" Smith said.(Reporting by Shariq Khan, additional reporting by Jeslyn Lerh in Singapore; Editing by Kirsten Donovan, David Goodman, Arun Koyyur, David Gregorio and Diane Craft)]"

Selling at an average price of US$102, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best move for these insiders because their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Morgan StanleyOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Eric Grossman, for US$3.4m worth of shares, at about US$102 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$93.07. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Morgan Stanley shares, than buying.

The world’s largest precious-metal market had run out of gold, drained by a five-month run on America’s stash by European central banks. The crisis marked the beginning of the end for the Bretton Woods standard that had kept the dollar pegged to gold, and currencies elsewhere to the dollar, since 1944.Now central banks are furiously buying gold again (see chart). In the third quarter alone 400 tonnes moved into their reserves. That has pushed the total from January to September to 670 tonnes, a pace unseen since the Bullion Market debacle. In May Turkey snapped up almost 20 tonnes in one go. India and Qatar are also ravenous. The metal now makes up two-thirds of Uzbekistan’s reserves, months after it planned to reduce gold to under half. Kazakhstan is also doubling down.In part this is because gold, snubbed in good times because it generates no yield, recovers its shine in times of volatility and high inflation. In the long run, it is seen as a store of value and, not tied to any individual economy, seems immune to local political and financial turmoil. Central bankers may also think they are getting a bargain. Even though it has resisted better than most, the price of the metal has dropped 3% this year. Gold bugs expect a rebound.Like in the past, however, buying gold bars is also a way to ditch some dollars. Except this time it is not Europe but emerging markets who grumble about the greenback. They need dollars to pay for imports and external debts. But their reserves are mostly made of treasuries, not actual banknotes. And as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates, buoying yields, the value of government paper has dropped. Lesser central banks have taken this as a cue to swap them for precious metal rather than bet on the Fed taming inflation.Shadier motives are also at play. Gold provides a way to circumvent Western sanctions on Russia, much of whose reserves have been frozen since March and whose banks have mostly been disconnected from the dollar-based international-payments system. Almost no central banks keep roubles as foreign-currency reserves. For those countries that traditionally do a fair bit of business with the Kremlin—from Turkey to Turkmenistan—gold offers an alternative, if clunky, means of exchange. This motley group of emerging markets have been among the biggest buyers of gold this time around.Story continuesThis is not something the West can do much about. Russian gold is banned on the London market, but no one can get at its gold reserves, which are mostly sourced from its own mines. And Russia’s central bank no longer reports how much gold it holds, making swaps impossible to track. Moving the physical metal is a logistical headache, but it keeps transactions under the West’s digital radar, which is useful for those playing both sides—like Qatar or Turkey. The World Gold Council, a trade body, says unknown buyers account for a big chunk of this year’s bonanza.One consolation for the dollar is that no other currency is gaining ground. The portion of foreign reserves held in yuan globally has stalled this year. The euro, yen and pound are treading water too. Central banks may have gold fever but there is no regime change on the horizon.For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, finance and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.© 2022 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

55,805a5e08-a0f6-348b-afe5-150638d28b08,FE,2022-12-01,"In Peru's hills, an artisanal miner boom frustrates Big Copper's plans",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/perus-hills-artisanal-miner-boom-111140165.html,1669893100,STORY,"['SCCO', 'GC=F', 'SI=F', 'HG=F']","[By Marco Aquino and Marcelo RochabrunTAPAIRIHUA, Peru (Reuters) - In the hills of Tapairihua in Peru's Andes, Samuel Retamozo and other artisanal miners have found a rich seam of copper on their indigenous community's land. Armed with temporary government permits, they started exploiting it earlier this year.There's just one problem - the seam is within the site of Southern Copper Corp's planned $2.6 billion Los Chancas mine. One of the world's biggest copper miners, it also has a permit to dig in the same area.Grupo Mexico's Southern Copper aims to start producing here in 2027 after decades of studies. The planned mine is crucial to the company's goal of producing 1.8 million tonnes of copper annually by 2030.But the rise of artisanal copper mining - driven by high global metal prices and sustained by a messy government permitting system - is threatening billions in new investments by Southern Copper and others in Peru, according to Reuters reviews of internal company reports, interviews with executives and a visit to Tapairihua to meet the miners.Small-scale copper miners are now challenging Big Copper for territorial control of rich deposits of the red metal. Artisanal copper mining is creating much-needed income for impoverished Andean Peruvians even as it brings them into conflict with major miners, a rare and previously unreported trend in the world's No. 2 copper producer.""This used to happen with silver and gold, but now it's affecting copper,"" said Raul Jacob, Southern Copper's chief financial officer, bemoaning what the company sees as the government's poor handling of artisanal mining permits.In Peru, artisanal mining permits have doubled to 80,000 since 2020, government records show. And copper is the new focus.Southern Copper is not the only mining company in a stand-off with the miners. Chinese-owned MMG Ltd's nearby Las Bambas copper mine is struggling to develop two new open pits because of artisanal miners who have settled on the same land. The company says its current pit is running out.Story continues""Informal mining is entering lands granted to formal (mining) companies and threatening the development of large-scale projects,"" a source close to MMG told Reuters.While companies often call small-scale miners ""informal"" or ""illegal,"" what complicates the matter are two dueling authorizations - one for artisanal mining and another to hold the mining rights to a given area. Mining companies own the latter, known as concessions.But since 2012 Peru has been granting artisanal mining permits on lands that overlap with concessions, giving the small-scale miners some legal protection, Reuters found after checking the geolocations of the permits and reviewing an internal document in which Peru's mining ministry did the same.POTENTIAL FOR MORE DISPUTESDisputes between mining firms and artisanal miners may only increase over time. Peru's leftist administration presented a new framework for artisanal mining last week that declared artisanal mining is ""as important"" as big mining.Southern Copper has asked the government to revoke all artisanal mining permits on its concession. About half have now been canceled, causing resentment in Tapairihua.""We are going to defend ourselves.

Armed with temporary government permits, they started exploiting it earlier this year.There's just one problem - the seam is within the site of Southern Copper Corp's planned $2.6 billion Los Chancas mine. One of the world's biggest copper miners, it also has a permit to dig in the same area.Grupo Mexico's Southern Copper aims to start producing here in 2027 after decades of studies. The planned mine is crucial to the company's goal of producing 1.8 million tonnes of copper annually by 2030.But the rise of artisanal copper mining - driven by high global metal prices and sustained by a messy government permitting system - is threatening billions in new investments by Southern Copper and others in Peru, according to Reuters reviews of internal company reports, interviews with executives and a visit to Tapairihua to meet the miners.Small-scale copper miners are now challenging Big Copper for territorial control of rich deposits of the red metal. Artisanal copper mining is creating much-needed income for impoverished Andean Peruvians even as it brings them into conflict with major miners, a rare and previously unreported trend in the world's No. 2 copper producer.""This used to happen with silver and gold, but now it's affecting copper,"" said Raul Jacob, Southern Copper's chief financial officer, bemoaning what the company sees as the government's poor handling of artisanal mining permits.In Peru, artisanal mining permits have doubled to 80,000 since 2020, government records show. And copper is the new focus.Southern Copper is not the only mining company in a stand-off with the miners. Chinese-owned MMG Ltd's nearby Las Bambas copper mine is struggling to develop two new open pits because of artisanal miners who have settled on the same land. The company says its current pit is running out.Story continues""Informal mining is entering lands granted to formal (mining) companies and threatening the development of large-scale projects,"" a source close to MMG told Reuters.While companies often call small-scale miners ""informal"" or ""illegal,"" what complicates the matter are two dueling authorizations - one for artisanal mining and another to hold the mining rights to a given area. Mining companies own the latter, known as concessions.But since 2012 Peru has been granting artisanal mining permits on lands that overlap with concessions, giving the small-scale miners some legal protection, Reuters found after checking the geolocations of the permits and reviewing an internal document in which Peru's mining ministry did the same.POTENTIAL FOR MORE DISPUTESDisputes between mining firms and artisanal miners may only increase over time. Peru's leftist administration presented a new framework for artisanal mining last week that declared artisanal mining is ""as important"" as big mining.Southern Copper has asked the government to revoke all artisanal mining permits on its concession. About half have now been canceled, causing resentment in Tapairihua.""We are going to defend ourselves. At the end of the day we are at home, and from home there is nowhere to go,"" Retamozo, a mining engineer and president of the Tapairihua Mining Association, told Reuters.While artisanal permits have existed since 2012, lower copper prices that decade meant they were not in demand.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had started surging on Monday amid investor hopefulness that Powell and other Fed officials have found reassurance in economic indicators showing inflation and the threat of a harsh recession waning. BTC sank below $15,500 two weeks ago as markets chewed on Genesis Global Capital's decision to halt withdrawals, part of the fallout from crypto exchange giant FTX's implosion. (Genesis is a CoinDesk sister company.)Bilal Little, president of DFD Partners, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program that this week's rally also reflected a price reordering that often follows periods of distress. ""Anytime you have an episodic event, markets tend to oversell, and what also happens is you see the immediate look to contagion, and everyone starts pointing fingers. Then as markets gain more clarity, you see the fair market value come back into alignment.""Story continuesEther was recently changing hands over $1,290, up 1.5% from Tuesday, same time. Other major altcoins were largely in the green with MATIC, the token of layer 2 scaling tool Polygon, rising more than 5%.

DOGE is trading well over 10 cents.Prices moved little late on Wednesday, seemingly unimpressed by former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's latest non-confessions in a New York Times live interview about the missteps leading to FTX's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11. Bankman-Fried spoke in generalities, often looking down at the floor as the Times' uber-reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin peppered him with questions. ""I didn't ever try to commit fraud,"" Bankman-Fried said at one point.Cryptos' upswing was small compared to equity markets, which soared on Powell's remarks at the Brookings Institution's Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Washington, D.C., that the Fed would likely raise interest rates 50 basis points (BPS) instead of continuing its recent diet of 75 bps increases. Investors were also heartened by the U.S.'s third quarter GDP, which grew 2.9%, up from the Commerce Department's original 2.6% estimate.DFD Partners' Little was pessimistic about crypto prices continuing to climb, saying that bitcoin would likely sink to the $12,000 to $13,000 level before topping $22,000, a level it last reached in October.

Although this funny internet money was subject to booms and busts, the programmability of blockchain technology was supposed to unlock trillions of dollars of real value. Beijing had identified it as a strategic technology, after all.But despite the $3.1 trillion in unlocked value that Gartner promised by 2030, industry use cases for blockchain continue to fade away.Recently, Maersk and IBM announced that TradeLens, the blockchain-based transparent ledger that was supposed to improve freight processing and customs clearance, will be wound down in 2023.“TradeLens has not reached the level of commercial viability necessary to continue work and meet the financial expectations as an independent business,” Maersk Head of Business Platforms Rotem Hershko said in a statement.Keywords: commercial viability. This seems to be the theme with enterprise blockchain applications. Executives aren’t able to determine why we need this as opposed to more traditional database technology.Earlier this month, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) said it was canceling a planned blockchain-based upgrade to its clearing house system. The existing system was performing well enough, and executives at the bourse couldn’t justify spending on a system upgrade that might not do much more than its predecessor.Amazon: Why blockchain?Tim Bray, one of the godfathers of web software development, offers an anecdote about all this on his blog. Until early 2020, Bray was a vice president at Amazon Web Services (AWS) beforere signing as a high-profile defector, vocally criticizing Amazon for its “vein of toxicity.”In 2016, presumably during happier times in his career at the company, Bray was in a meeting with Andy Jassy, then-CEO of AWS, and the topic was blockchain. Bray writes (the entire post is worth reading) that Jassy was hearing from his clients that AWS needed a blockchain strategy. But Jassy couldn’t understand why blockchain was necessary when existing tools provided sufficient solutions.AWS was already making a ton of money from blockchain. Many of the world’s crypto exchanges or other infrastructure projects host their products on the platform (see: the $4.6 million AWS bill to Alameda/FTX). But this is different than what the world’s industrial and commercial giants were being told they wanted. They needed to integrate blockchain, investors said, and it was up to AWS to implement this.“I can’t remember the details of how our findings got back to Andy. They were of the form 'Ledgers are useful, cryptography tech is useful, blockchains aren’t, the field is full of grifters, but we could build distributed-ledger infrastructure and then these cool services on top of it,’” Bray wrote. “I’m not prepared to say that no blockchain-based system will ever be useful for anything. But I’m gonna stay negative until I see one actually at work doing something useful, without number-go-up greedheads clamped on its teats.”AWS still has a blockchain segment, and is said to be in the process of preparing to double down on China, the only market where enterprise blockchain continues to exist at scale because of state diktat (where’s the on-chain data?).Meanwhile, its competitor, Microsoft Azure, has shuttered its cloud blockchain services. As CoinDesk reported last year, IBM’s blockchain division is a “shell of its former self.”Bray noted in his post that it wasn’t the role of AWS to “ascertain market realities.” They needed to build what the customer wanted. Jaffy, the executive in charge of the division, was “possibly the world’s single most accomplished person at listening to people talk about Enterprise IT problems and the tools needed to fix them,” and if he couldn’t see the value of this technology, it probably wasn’t worth anyone’s time.But at the time, if you questioned the technology, you were a “peasant,” as Bray noted, because all the ""Serious Enterprises full of Serious People” were about to adopt blockchain.And now, those that did are abandoning it.Let’s just admit that it was all a failure.Important events3:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(7:00 UTC) Germany's Retail Sales (YoY/Oct)9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) Bank of Japan Governor Kuroda speech11:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(15:00 UTC) United States ISM Manufacturing PMI (Nov)CoinDesk TVIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Bitcoin Rises Toward $17K; BlockFi Has $355M in Crypto Frozen on FTXCrypto lender BlockFi has about $355 million in cryptocurrencies currently frozen on defunct crypto exchange FTX.

He will leave the company on Jan. 31, 2023.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly culture“Marc was my mentor well before I joined Salesforce and the opportunity to partner with him to lead the most important software company in the world is career-defining,” Taylor said in his parting statement. “After a lot of reflection, I’ve decided to return to my entrepreneurial roots. Salesforce has never been more relevant to customers, and with its best-in-class management team and the company executing on all cylinders, now is the right time for me to step away.”Benioff labelled Taylor’s decision to resign “bittersweet.”Bret Taylor’s corporate and “entrepreneurial roots”Starting out as a product manager for Google, Taylor made waves as the founder of FriendFeed—a feed aggregator and social network that Facebook (now Meta) acquired in 2009. At Google and Facebook, he has been credited with building Maps and the Like button respective.Taylor, who was Facebook’s chief technology officer during its 2012 IPO, left the company to build a startup. He made Quip, a mobile-first word processor, to “do for tablets and phones what Microsoft Office did for the PC.” That got him a foot in the door at Salesforce. The San Francisco-based cloud giant acquired Quip in 2016 for $750 million, and got Taylor as part of the bargain.Taylor has spent six years at Salesforce. Most recently, he worked as president and chief operating officer before being elevated to co-CEO. He was a key figure in brokering Salesforce’s $27.7 billion takeover of workspace messaging platform Slack in July 2021.The case for a co-CEOMarc Benioff: “I have found that having a co-CEO relationship is extremely important, because it allows more balance in the operation of the company. If it is the right relationship, then it can have tremendous power and capability inside of the company but also give more coverage to the customers and to investors and to the stakeholders.”Story continuesSalesforce, by the digits3%: The share of Salesforce that Benioff owns6%: The fall in Salesforce’s stock in after-hours trading, after news of Taylor’s departure broke, even as the company posted better-than-expected quarterly results40%: The fall in Salesforce’s shares since the start of the year$22.8 million: Taylor’s remuneration in fiscal year 2022Are two CEOs better than one?Industry watchers expected the Taylor-Benioff association to be a long-lasting one. “His departure raises questions about why he’s leaving and how operational leadership will be divided and delegated,” Steve Koenig, managing director at SMBC Nikko Securities, told Reuters.The previous co-CEO, Keith Block, also didn’t last very long, serving 18 months from 2018 to 2020.The co-CEO model has both pros and cons, Maksym Liashko, CEO of the product company Parimatch Tech, which had two CEOs until April this year, wrote for the publication Entrepreneur. On the one hand, “two heads are better than one,” Liashko wrote, adding that it leaves room for brainstorming and getting second opinions. But on the other hand, this deliberation can turn decision-making into a more time-consuming process. The model can also blur the line of responsibility and accountability for shareholders, investors, and employees.But that doesn’t mean it can’t be done. In fact, Harvard Business Review (HBR) research points to co-CEO tenures lasting as long as sole CEOs’—and generating better shareholder returns along the way. It may not be the right fit for every company, but many could do with spreading out responsibilities.“Under the right circumstances, it’s remarkable how much co-CEOs can do. They can bring deep and diverse competencies, backgrounds, and perspectives to the job. They can be in two places at once—literally. They can form a left-brain/right-brain partnership,” HBR noted. “If one half of the duo leaves, the other can ensure a stable transition. And co-CEOs double a company’s opportunity to diversify the C-suite.”Chip Kaye, who was co-CEO of the private equity firm Warburg Pincus before becoming sole CEO, said sharing power helps keep “egos in check.”Which companies have had co-CEOs?A slew of companies have had robust runs with the co-CEO structure:Grocer Whole Foods had two co-CEOs between 2010 and 2016.Chipotle had two CEOs for seven years until it went back to one in 2016 after a year of food crises caused sales and the stock to plummet.Workday, the HR software giant, moved to a two-CEO arrangement in 2020, splitting the order of business. Aneel Bhusri, the co-founder, handles product and technologies as well as corporate functions, including the offices for HR, finance, and operations, while Chano Fernandez oversees the entire customer relationship, ranging from acquisition to customer services to support.Oracle took on co-CEOs in 2014. It followed that model until one of them died in 2019.Atlassian, the software firm, is perhaps the most successful example of a company that has split the top job. Its co-founders have been co-CEOs for 20 years. One ✂️ thing: Bret Taylor’s other job at Twitter is gone, tooThe week Taylor was designated co-CEO at Salesforce, he was also named board chair at Twitter. He has shepherded the board during Elon Musk’s tumultuous takeover of the microblogging company this year. Then, last month, Musk dissolved the board and Taylor’s role within it.Related stories👀 Four days, 170,000 people, and one Metallica concert later, I figured out what Salesforce is⭐ Salesforce uses Glassdoor like Yelp for billion-dollar buyout decisions🏢 How Salesforce, IBM, and HSBC are approaching return to work nowMore from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Shares have added about 10.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Flowserve due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Flowserve Q3 Earnings and Revenues Miss EstimatesFlowserve’s third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings (excluding 20 cents from non-recurring items) of 9 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents. The bottom line declined approximately 67% year over year. Supply-chain woes and inflationary pressure hurt the performance.Flowserve’s total sales of $872.9 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $877 million. However, the top line increased 0.8% year over year. Sales increased 7.2% on a constant-currency basis.Aftermarket sales in the reported quarter increased 4.5% year over year (or up 10.6% on a constant-currency basis) to $460.8 million. Original equipment sales totaled $412.1 million, reflecting a decrease of 3.1% (up 3.6% on a constant-currency basis).Bookings totaled $1.22 billion in the quarter, reflecting an increase of 34.2% (or 40.8% on a constant-currency basis) from the year-ago quarter. The backlog at the end of the reported quarter was $2.6 billion, up 29.9% year over year.Segmental DetailsThe company currently has two reportable segments — Flowserve Pump Division and Flow Control Division. A brief discussion of the segments is provided below:Revenues from the Flowserve Pump Division were $592.6 million, down 1.5% year over year. Bookings rose 40.1% to $925.8 million.Revenues from the Flow Control Division were $282.6 million, up 6.2% year over year. Bookings of $300 million increased 18.3%.Margin ProfileIn the third quarter, Flowserve’s cost of sales increased 3.4% year over year to $633.3 million. It represented 72.6% of sales compared with 70.7% in the year-ago quarter. Gross profit decreased 5.5% to $253.5 million, and margin contracted 190 basis points (bps) to 27.4%. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $221.1 million, up 10.1% year over year. It represented 25.3% of sales.Operating income in the quarter decreased 57.8% year over year to $24.2 million. Adjusted operating margin deteriorated to 2.4% from 7% in the year-ago quarter. The effective tax rate was 4.3% in the quarter.Story continuesBalance Sheet and Cash FlowExiting the third quarter, Flowserve had cash and cash equivalents of $ 351.9 million compared with $658.5 million at the end of December 2021. Long-term debt (due after one year) was $1.2 billion, compared with $1.3 billion at the end of December 2021.In the first nine months of 2022, the company used net cash of $109.5 million from operating activities versus $151.1 million generated in the year-ago period. Capital expenditure in the period totaled $45.8 million, up 34.7% from the year ago.During the first nine months of the year, the company used $78.4 million for distributing dividends. Flowserve did not buy back shares during the period.OutlookFlowserve expects an 8-10% year-over-year increase in revenues in fourth-quarter 2022. The company anticipates reported and adjusted earnings per share of approximately 40 cents for the quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted -35.09% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Flowserve has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Flowserve has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerFlowserve is part of the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Jim Cramer Stock Portfolio: 5 Recent Additions. CNBC’s Jim Cramer said on November 15 that he believes the Federal Reserve could manage to control inflation without the economy spiraling into a recession. Some of the stocks recently backed by Jim Cramer ahead of a potential market recovery include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). He explained: “If we can see the end of the purchasing spree … It's a huge positive for stocks. It helps that we’ve finally worked out the kinks in the supply chain that were creating shortages all over the place. Put it all together, and there’s a real possibility the Fed can indeed engineer a fabled soft landing for the economy.”On November 21, Cramer forecasted that the S&amp;P 500 will potentially rally next month. He referred to the market scenario where stocks climb close to the end of the year. He interpreted Larry Williams’ model of the S&amp;P 500 index’s seasonal pattern, noting: “Between the seasonal pattern and the short-term cycle, and also the extremely positive long-term cycle that we covered a few weeks ago, he’s seeing a lot of green lights to start buying.”Our Methodology These stocks were picked keeping in mind the latest calls that Jim Cramer made on these equities during his appearances on news platform CNBC in November 2022. Jim Cramer Stock Portfolio: 10 Recent AdditionsJim Cramer Stock Portfolio: Recent Additions10.

(NYSE:MP) is a Las Vegas-based company that owns and operates rare earth mining and processing facilities, offering rare earth minerals including cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, praseodymium, and samarium. In Cramer’s lightning round on November 18, he told viewers: “It’s doing a great job, they’ve got a contract with GM ... GM’s a winner, and so is MP.”Story continues MP Materials Corp. (NYSE:MP) is one of the recent stock picks of Jim Cramer. On November 3, MP Materials Corp. (NYSE:MP) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.36 and a revenue of $124.45 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.06 and $6.73 million, respectively. Revenue for the period climbed approximately 25% year-over-year, supported by an increase in the realized price of rare earth oxide.Canaccord analyst George Gianarikas on September 28 maintained a Buy rating on MP Materials Corp. (NYSE:MP) but lowered the price target on the shares to $40 from $47. The analyst reduced his estimates due to weakness in NdPr prices, a trend he observed from late August. However, he justified his rating given the value creation path in stages 2 and 3 of the company's evolution and MP Materials Corp. (NYSE:MP)’s increasing strategic importance.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 36 hedge funds were bullish on MP Materials Corp. (NYSE:MP) at the end of September 2022, compared to 26 funds in the prior quarter. Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), MP Materials Corp. (NYSE:MP) is one of the stocks favored by Jim Cramer.  ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about MP Materials Corp. (NYSE:MP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“ClearBridge has visited and engaged with holding MP Materials Corp. (NYSE:MP), for example, a U.S. mining company with a facility that supplies neodymium and praseodymium, two rare earth minerals used to make powerful magnets found in 90% of EV motors. The facility recycles all water from its process such that recycled water meets 95% of the facility’s water needs, while the rest comes from groundwater. In the recycling process, wastewater is piped to an on-site water treatment plant where it is treated using reverse osmosis and then reused. In a recent engagement with the company, we encouraged it to disclose the groundwater extraction quantities that make up the other 5% and compare these to peers.”9. Howmet Aerospace Inc. (NYSE:HWM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Howmet Aerospace Inc. (NYSE:HWM) is a Pennsylvania-based company that specializes in advanced engineered solutions for the aerospace and transportation industries worldwide. It operates through four segments – Engine Products, Fastening Systems, Engineered Structures, and Forged Wheels. The company expects 2023 revenue growth versus 2022 to be up approximately 10%. On November 21, on Mad Money’s Lightning Round, Jim Cramer backed Howmet Aerospace Inc.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a California-based semiconductor company operating worldwide. On November 22, the Mad Money host said: “Once the Fed relents, I’d much rather be in Big Tech, or the top cloud plays, or the better-run chipmakers like AMD and Nvidia.” Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the latest stocks backed by Cramer. On November 15, Credit Suisse analyst Chris Caso initiated coverage of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global fabless semiconductor company focusing on high-performance computing technology, software, and products. AMD designs leading high-performance central and graphics processing units (known as CPUs and GPUs) and integrates them with hardware and software to build differentiated solutions for customers.AMD has been gaining meaningful share in personal computing and server end markets over the past several years driven by the performance of its processors and technology and strong execution against its technology roadmap, and we believe share gains will continue over the coming years from a combination of AMD’s continued advancements and Intel’s stumbles in developing its leading-edge technology.Additionally, the recently closed acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando enhance AMD’s positioning within the data center, a key growth engine for the semiconductor industry, and Xilinx specifically opens up several new growth opportunities in new end markets like industrial, automotive, and communications. The company also generates significant cash flow, giving it capital allocation optionality for further M&amp;A and returning capital to shareholders.”7. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a California-based company that provides graphics, computing, semiconductors, and networking solutions in the United States, Taiwan, China, and internationally.

The company's Q3 results were ""solid"" with data center revenue outlook somewhat higher despite soft China data center sales and accelerating H100 adoption, the analyst told investors in a research note. He added that while China is weighing on overall results, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is executing nicely despite these headwinds.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 89 hedge funds were long NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), compared to 84 funds in the last quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 3.3 million shares worth $410.8 million. Vulcan Value Partners made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also sold NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) during the quarter to allocate capital to new purchases and to add to existing positions in the portfolio. NVIDIA is facing multiple headwinds. Data center revenue growth is slowing, gaming revenue growth is declining, and the United States has issued new export controls to China that impact NVDIA’s products. We believe NVDIA’s competitive advantages are intact, and it remains on our MVP list. In the right circumstances we would be delighted to own it in the future.”6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the leading American entertainment conglomerates. On November 21, CNBC’s Jim Cramer said that he is bullish on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) now that Bob Iger is back to the chief executive role. He further elaborated: “Disney’s the defining story of the day. This is a good example of how you can stick with an iconic company … and make money when they bring in a better leader. And that’s exactly what I see happening as Iger takes the helm.” Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth on November 22 maintained a Buy rating on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) but lowered the price target on the shares to $177 from $229 given a re-rating of value due to near-term linear network pressure. Nonetheless, the analyst sees the return of former CEO Bob Iger leading the company back to creativity, and likes the ongoing release of blockbuster content, which will continue to drive growth. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s robust balance sheet, cash flow, and prudent capital allocation will allow it to invest in content development, new theme park attractions, and growth initiatives, the analyst added. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is on his Research Focus List and Focus Opportunity Portfolio.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 112 hedge funds were bullish on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), compared to 109 funds in the earlier quarter. Arrowstreet Capital held a prominent position in the company, with 3.5 million shares worth about $331 million. Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the stocks recently backed by Jim Cramer. Here is what Third Point specifically said about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“As disclosed in our Q2 letter, we reinitiated a significant position in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) when the company retested its Covid lows earlier this year. At the current price, Disney is trading for little more than the stand-alone value of its Parks business and a mere 15x ’24 “street” consensus. The company remains early in its Direct to Consumer (“DTC”) transition with a leading market position, and yet the current stock price ascribes negligible value to the streaming business. We believe this is due to questions around the terminal economics of streaming, given large losses being generated today at Disney (&gt;$1 billion dollars last quarter) and stagnating margins at peers such as Netflix. On the last earnings call, management highlighted three items that could lead to an inflection in DTC profitability over the next 12 months: a 38% price increase for Disney+ in the US; moderating growth in cash content expense; and an advertising tier for Disney+ launching in two months that can drive additional ARPU given high demand for the Disney brand amongst advertisers.While the company has guided Disney+ achieving breakeven sometime within the fiscal year ending September 2024, the valuation suggests the market remains skeptical. Disney only trades at ~14x the $7 in earnings generated prior to the Fox acquisition, which implies investors don’t expect earnings to meaningfully exceed this figure in the coming years. Hence, the first value driver we highlighted in our last letter is the opportunity for management to optimize Disney’s cost base to drive earnings growth. We believe Disney has ample means to rationalize costs across its operating platform and deliver targeted content for home viewing that does not entail the same cost structure of exclusive theatrical releases…” (Click here to view the full text) Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Stock Portfolio: 5 Recent Additions.  Suggested articles:15 Most Valuable Telecom Companies in the World11 Best Gas Stocks To Buy10 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

We just might if they don’t start taking advantage of the money moves that could make them rich.Let’s have a look at 11 mistakes millennials could be making that prevent them from getting rich.Not Maxing Out Their 401(k) and Roth IRAs“The biggest mistake people make is not maxing out their 401(k) and taking advantage of the minimum they need to invest so that their employer matches,” said Rachel Ehrlich, co-founder of Klutch. “Tax advantages are crucial and they tend to be forgotten. Just adding your allowable investment into your Roth IRA every year will make a huge difference in the long term.”Failing To Use a Health Savings Account“A Health Savings Account (HSA) can be a great place to save money for millennials that have to pay for high-deductible health insurance,” said Doug Carey, the owner and president of WealthTrace. “The money grows tax free and is deposited pre-tax, which means you are not taxed on the amount you contribute each year, similar to saving to a 401(k) plan. Savings into an HSA can be used to pay the premiums for health insurance and any medical expenses.”Take Our Poll: Do You Think People Should Invest In Crypto?Paying for Subscriptions Out of Convenience“Many people pay for subscriptions that they do not use,” said Andrew Griffith, associate professor of accounting at the LaPenta School of Business of Iona University. “Or they pay for subscriptions that provide redundant benefits, meaning these are available to them via other subscriptions they are currently paying for. Or they pay for subscriptions when they could eliminate the cost up front with a one-time fee.Story continues“For example, Microsoft 365 Family sells for $99.99 per year. The perpetual license for Microsoft’s Office Home and Student 2021 is $149.99. Two years of Microsoft 365 Family costs more than the perpetual license. One can replace Microsoft 365 with alternatives such as free Google Workspace products. When a specific paid product is not necessary, a free or lower cost legitimate substitute product is normally sufficient.”Falling Victim to Lifestyle Inflation“The phenomenon of ‘lifestyle inflation’ or ‘lifestyle creep’ occurs when previously indulgent goods are now viewed as needs,” said Bruce Mohr, senior investment advisor at Fair Credit. “The drive to keep up with others is fostered by social media. More millennials are spending the majority of their income on goods that only give them satisfaction and prestige in the short term due to a combination of the fear of missing out and an ‘I earned it’ mentality.”Paying Off Student Loans Too Quickly“It might sound counterintuitive, but too many millennials worry so much about their student loan debt that they pay it down at the cost of their retirement savings,” Carey said. “Many student loan interest rates are much lower than the rate of return they can get by saving into a 401(k) plan. And that does not even take into account the tax benefits and possible contribution match from employers.”Not Saving Automatically“Automatically contributing to savings directly out of one’s paycheck keeps that person from seeing these funds in your bank account, which reduces the amount of disposable funds available to that person,” Griffith said. “I believe in saving as much as possible to fund the retirement years and doing this directly out of our paychecks.”Investing Too Late in Life“Investing early in life lets the power of compounding take hold,” Carey said. “The earlier people can save, the better. I always show younger people a picture of investments compounding over time. This helps give them a tangible idea of what saving early and often can do for them.“I go through an example such as this: If a 30-year-old is able to save $10,000 to a 401(k) plan every year and earn 8%, that person will have slightly over $1.2 million saved in 30 years. But a 40-year-old who saves the same amount for 20 years would have just over $494,000. This shows the awesome power of compounding, and it is why it is so important that people start saving at a young age if they can.”Keeping Too Much in Volatile Assets“While more recent assets like NFTs, meme stocks, SPACs and cryptocurrencies may have appealing growth potential, ignoring their volatility puts your financial stability in severe danger,” Mohr said. “Due to social media, there is a good probability that everyone knows someone who took advantage of at least one of these opportunities to swiftly accumulate wealth.”According to Mohr, this is also referred to as the “Shiny Object Syndrome.”“Younger investors trying to accumulate wealth quickly are attracted to high-risk, high-volatility assets, which can make long-term, more traditional methods of wealth accumulation, like equities, seem dull,” Mohr said. “However, investing all of your money in risky securities like NFTs or cryptocurrencies is exceedingly risky. When it comes to financial planning, preparing for the worst rather than seeking the best return is more important.”Not Diversifying Investments“Another mistake millennials make is not diversifying their investments,” said Kyle Marquardt, CPA and financial specialist at Homestead Brands. “When you invest, you shouldn’t put all your eggs in one basket. Instead, you should diversify your investments. That way, you’ll be less likely to lose money if one investment goes sour.”Panicking in Recessions“Millennials are particularly prone to this as many of us, including myself, were not at working age when the ’07 crisis hit,” said James Beckett, a writer for the passive investing website Tiny High. “We therefore do not fully appreciate how recessions can impact us. For a millennial investor, it means they might panic sell at the worst time, when they should be buying.”Not Staying the Course“Many millennials make the mistake of not staying the course when it comes to investing,” said John Dave, a financial advisor and the owner of Wealthy Panther. “They may see the stock market fluctuate and decide to sell their investments, only to buy back in at a higher price.”More From GOBankingRates25 Sneaky Car Dealership Tricks To Avoid at All CostsSocial Security Payment Schedule 2023: What Dates To Watch Out ForThe 10 Best Balance Transfer Credit Cards for 20236 Most Effective Ways to Build Your Credit ScoreThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 11 Mistakes That Stop Millennials From Building Wealth]"

In addition, the increasing demand for cloud services, as well as the availability of a wide range of cloud solutions that can be tailored to meet specific business needs that are driving the growth of the global cloud computing market.Growth stocks have gotten hammered in 2022 due to high interest rates that have hurt their valuations. The Nasdaq Composite has tanked more than 30% year to date, as of November 28.

This article will discuss some of the best cloud computing stocks to buy heading into 2023 which include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc.

We narrowed down our selection to companies that had strong product pipelines and robust business models. Moreover, we gave weight to the market sentiment around each stock and only included stocks that had positive market sentiment.

SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is a global leader in enterprise software solutions and has been a major player in the software-as-a-service (SaaS) and cloud computing markets for years. The company has a strong presence in the enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) software markets and its solutions are used by businesses of all sizes around the world. The company has consistently reported strong financial results, with revenue and earnings growth in recent years driven by strong demand for its solutions and services. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) has also invested heavily in developing its cloud-based solutions and services. This has helped to drive growth and attract new customers. The company is also investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies, which it believes will be key to its future success.SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) holds a strong cash position and has free cash flows of EUR 3.87 billion. The company is well-positioned to grow its market share in the cloud computing industry and is among the best cloud computing stocks to buy now.

ERP is a software category that is particularly critical to business functions, and, therefore, has high retention rates even in times of economic stress. For the past several years, SAP has been going through several transitions, including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters, we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed, and the result should be a faster-growing, more consistent, higher margin, and more advantaged business. As investment costs from these transition programs wane, and as the benefits of higher growth continue, we expect that earnings will grow at a double-digit rate from next year (2023) onwards. In light of this, we believe the valuation is very attractive for longterm investors.”In addition to SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), big-tech companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are well-positioned to capitalize on the secular growth trends in the global cloud computing market.14.

While we think process automation is a growing market, in a slowing macro environment single solutions may be more vulnerable than the platform solutions of software providers who can bundle products to meet a wide range of needs. In addition, the company has a material component of sales sourced in Europe where the economy is more vulnerable.”13.

Its shares fell because of softening demand from its small- and medium-sized customers, the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and a deceleration in its marketing related offerings. In addition, a well-communicated reduction in potential users for Veeva’s CRM platform, because of sales headcount reductions among certain life sciences customers, implied a possible deceleration in growth rates. Despite these challenges, we see increasing traction of its newer products among large pharmaceutical customers that we expect to generate significant profitable growth in the coming years.”11.

FIVN is well-positioned as contact centers transition to the cloud with high customer retention (120% last quarter), the doubling of its strategic sales team over the past year, and new partnerships, including with AT&amp;T, CDW and Microsoft. We believe the company can grow its top-line at more than 20% annually, improve its 60% gross margins, and expand EBITDA margin to more than 20%, all of which should lead to 30%+ EPS growth for the foreseeable future. The company should turn FCF-positive this year and continue to expand its FCF growth in the years to come given its highly capital efficient business model.”10.

Over the years, JIRA has become the industry standard for developer collaboration tools, which has driven Atlassian to benefit from durable growth, compounding revenues over 30% for nine consecutive years with free cash flows compounding at higher rates. Atlassian’s opportunity is underpinned by three large markets (DevOps, IT service management, and Work Management) with product leadership in each area, and a disruptive go-to-market model. Atlassian’s products are easy to use and are still primarily purchased online via a highly efficient self-service model, driving attractive unit economics with substantially lower-than-industry Sales and Marketing spend at approximately 15% of revenues (versus 30% to 40% for peers), enabling it to invest more in R&amp;D and powering disruptive pricing dynamics (where customers get similar or better functionality for a much lower price)Additionally, Atlassian began its business model shift to the cloud in earnest in fiscal year 2020 which has driven accelerating subscription growth of over 50% for the last five quarters (with only about 10 points of growth due to cloud migrations). The model transition is expected to mature in fiscal year 2024, which should unlock smoother long-term cross selling and up selling activity, opening an opportunity to drive up average customer spending by six to eight times over time. While seat expansion remains the most important revenue growth driver in the near term, the recently introduced Enterprise and Premium offerings, priced at a one and a half to three times compared to the standard package, are also starting to contribute, and are expected become even more prominent with the cloud transition…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

(NYSE:WDAY) is a leader in cloud-based human capital management (HCM) solutions, providing software and services to manage payroll, recruiting, and other core HCM functions.

The company sells to more than 9,500 medium-sized through enterprise customers across more than 175 countries, including more than 50% of the Fortune 500.The company is benefitting from the secular shift to digitization for businesses and despite its 21% annual subscription revenue CAGR over the past 2 years (with 95%+ gross revenue retention), Workday still has less than 5% penetration of its $105 billion TAM. We believe the company can grow its top-line high-teens over the long-term, while continuing to improve margins (non-GAAP gross operating margin expanded 900 basis points to 22.4% over the past two years), leading to approximately 30% EPS growth for the foreseeable future.

83,4698e97a-cdfe-3efc-a863-3905232b7470,MSFT,2022-12-01,Amazon (AMZN) Expands AWS Portfolio Offerings With DataZone,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-amzn-expands-aws-portfolio-161104936.html,1669824664,STORY,"['AMZN', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL']","[Amazon AMZN is making every effort to strengthen its presence in the booming cloud market on the back of its portfolio strength.The company’s cloud division, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), introduced a new data management service, namely Amazon DataZone, at AWS re:Invent event. This testifies to the aforesaid fact.The new service eases the data management process and enables data producers to govern data access seamlessly. Further, it makes the task of driving business insights easier for data consumers by helping them discover, use and collaborate on data.With the help of Machine Learning (ML), the service discards the heavy lifting of maintaining a data catalog. It also helps in suggesting metadata for each dataset. This apart, Amazon DataZone includes AWS analytics services like Amazon Redshift, Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight.This integration protects data consumers from managing separate login credentials for these services while working on a data project. The underlined service also provides application programming interfaces (APIs) to the customers.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteCustomer Base to ExpandWe believe that the underlined service will help AWS to gain strong momentum among various businesses as it provides seamless data access to engineers, data scientists, product managers, analysts and business users in an organization.Notably, customers like ENGIE, Fox Corporation and Itau have already shown interest in AWS DataZone.We believe that the growing customer momentum will continue to drive AWS's top line.In third-quarter 2022, AWS generated revenues of $20.5 billion (16% of total sales), which grew 27% year over year.Bottom LineWe believe that AWS’s strengthening clientele across the world will continue to aid Amazon in gaining a competitive edge against its strong peers like Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet's GOOGL Google.Microsoft Azure has become the key growth driver for Microsoft. The company is currently riding on the robust adoption of Azure cloud offerings. Azure's increasing number of availability zones and regions globally, along with strength in its consumption-based business, is likely to continue driving Microsoft's cloud momentum in the near term.Similarly, Google Cloud is contributing substantial growth to the total revenues of Alphabet. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting Alphabet's cloud position.Nevertheless, AWS’s growing efforts toward strengthening its portfolio offerings are likely to keep it ahead of the above-mentioned peers.Apart from Amazon DataZone, the company announced a new service called Amazon Security Lake, which is a purpose-built security data lake. It automatically centralizes an organization’s security data from cloud and on-premises sources into a purpose-built data lake.It also announced a fully managed compute service, namely AWS SimSpace Weaver, that enables customers to deploy spatial simulations to model dynamic systems with many data points.Further, it announced a new cloud application called AWS Supply Chain, which provides improved supply chain visibility to businesses.Additionally, it introduced a new analytics service called AWS Clean Rooms that helps customers analyze and collaborate on collective datasets without revealing underlying data.We believe that portfolio strength will continue to drive AWS’ customer momentum, which, in turn, will aid Amazon in sustaining its cloud dominance. This will instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.Notably, Amazon has lost 43.6% on a year-to-date basis.According to the latest Canalys report, AWS accounted for 32% of global cloud spending in third-quarter 2022, maintaining its leading position in the booming cloud market.Microsoft’s Azure, the second-largest cloud-service provider, accounted for 22% of worldwide cloud spending. Alphabet’s Google Cloud represented 9% of cloud spending, marking it the third-largest cloud provider.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Stock to ConsiderCurrently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector is Asure Software ASUR, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

84,6b181cd4-14e6-3f87-bd64-0c3829c2df23,MSFT,2022-12-01,David Tepper Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/david-tepper-stock-portfolio-top-133736681.html,1669815456,STORY,"['AMZN', 'UNH', 'MSFT', 'AR', 'GOOGL', 'EQT', 'M']","[In this article we delve into the David Tepper Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks. Click to skip ahead to the David Tepper Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are some of the top stock picks of billionaire money manager and Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper.David Tepper co-founded the Miami Beach, Florida-based hedge fund Appaloosa Management in 1993. Tepper earned a Bachelor of Arts in economics from the University of Pittsburgh and later an MBA from Carnegie Mellon’s business school, which was named after him in 2004. He worked as a credit analyst with Goldman Sachs for seven years, specializing in distressed debt, before leaving the firm in 1992 and launching his own fund a year later.Appaloosa has been one of the best performing hedge funds in the world since inception, generating annualized returns of about 25% through 2018 and elevating Tepper to billionaire status more than a decade prior to that. Tepper’s net worth is currently estimated by Forbes at $15.4 billion, ranking him the 98th richest person in the world.Tepper, who is in the process of closing his firm to outside money and converting Appaloosa into a family office, has taken a bearish stance on equities in recent quarters. His fund’s 13F AUM has declined for six straight quarters, including by 59% during the first half of 2022. Considering 70% of the firm's assets were in-house as of 2020, returning money to shareholdersThat bearish stance persisted in Q3, as Tepper’s fund didn’t make a single addition to its 13F portfolio or even increase the size of any of its existing holdings. On the other hand, it sold off eight of its former holdings and reduced the size of 12 other holdings. All told, Appaloosa’s 13F AUM stood at just $1.36 billion at the end of Q3, down from $6.96 billion at the end of Q1 2021.Appaloosa remained heavily invested in communications and consumer discretionary stocks, while utilities and telecommunications stocks jumped to the highest weighting in its 13F portfolio. It’s also the greatest exposure Appaloosa’s 13F portfolio has had to telecommunications stocks since 2003. Energy stocks also had double-digit weighting in Appaloosa’s 13F portfolio for the seventh straight quarter.Story continuesIn this article, we’ll take a look at the stocks that David Tepper has maintained the strongest conviction in while his overall market outlook continues to be decidedly bearish.David Tepper Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock PicksOur MethodologyThe following data is gathered from Appaloosa Management’s latest 13F filing with the SEC. We follow hedge funds like Appaloosa Management because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q3 2022 reporting period.David Tepper Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks10. Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR)Value of Appaloosa Management‘s 13F Position: $32.8 Million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 65 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are a few of the prominent holdings in David Tepper’s stock portfolio. Also cracking the top 10 is Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR), one of several energy companies that Tepper is bullish on. He trimmed the size of several of those holdings during Q3, including AR, which was cut by 13% to 1.25 million shares.Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR) trailing twelve month (TTM) revenue has soared to $8.4 billion compared to just $3.08 billion in 2020. Thanks to the natural gas company’s cost of revenue rising only marginally during that time, its gross profit has soared from negative $514 million in 2020 to $4.73 billion over the TTM period. Jefferies analyst Lloyd Byrne has a ‘Buy’ rating and $47 price target on AR, noting that the option value on energy stocks is up again and could stay higher for longer without the need for added investment.Hedge fund ownership of Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR) rose for eight straight quarters through Q2, tripling during that time and hitting an all-time high before dipping slightly in Q3. D E Shaw, Two Sigma Advisors, and Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management are some of the biggest shareholders of Antero Resources.9. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Value of Appaloosa Management‘s 13F Position: $54.7 Million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 272 David Tepper trimmed his fund’s Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) holding by 6% during Q3 to 235,000 shares. Microsoft is in a dead heat with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) (another favored stock of Tepper’s) as the single most popular ticker among hedge funds. No fewer than 250 funds have been long MSFT each quarter over the past two years. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, managed by Michael Larson, is the largest Microsoft shareholder among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares are down by 28% this year and a weakening PC market is cause for minor concern, with the company’s More Personal Computing segment contracting slightly in Q1 of Microsoft’s fiscal year (FY) 2023. The company’s other segments continue to steam ahead though regardless of the broader economic conditions, as intelligent cloud revenue grew by 20% year-over-year and overall operating income was up by 6% to $21.5 billion. Microsoft is also a major free cash flow (FCF) machine, topping $63 billion in FCF over the past year.Carillon Tower also believes Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is performing well in spite of what the stock market might lead you to believe, as noted in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Despite reporting very good quarterly results, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) underperformed the overall market in August. Technology stocks in general underperformed in August due to fears over slowing global economic growth, potentially leading to cuts in corporate information technology budgets.”8. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) Value of Appaloosa Management‘s 13F Position: $75.8 Million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 112 David Tepper’s position in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) was left unchanged during Q3 at an even 150,000 shares. The billionaire money manager sold off 29,000 UNH shares during the first half of 2022. United Health hit an all-time high in hedge fund ownership during Q3 after a 16% jump in the number of funds long UNH during the quarter. Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global and Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management were among the funds that added UNH to their 13F portfolios during Q3.Healthcare is a relatively safe industry to invest in during a recession, as most people are not willing to compromise their health and avoid having necessary surgical procedures or other interventions carried out regardless of their economic health. If anything, and especially given the rising costs associated with healthcare, it will make people increasingly more willing to invest in health insurance. That’s evidenced by the strong performance of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), which has grown revenue by 14% year-over-year through the first nine months of 2022. The company’s EPS is also projected to rise by about 16% this year to $20.95 at the midpoint of the health insurer’s guidance range.Distillate Capital still likes UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)’s valuation even after the stock has greatly outperformed the market this year, as the fund stated in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“UnitedHealth Group was among the 2 largest trims at around 1% each. Each stock was up 1% in the quarter compared to the 16% price decline for the S&amp;P 500 and the positions were reduced as the valuations became somewhat less appealing, though still attractive enough to warrant inclusion.”7. Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M)Value of Appaloosa Management‘s 13F Position: $94 Million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 31 Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M) had been a top five stock pick of Tepper’s for several quarters until Q3, when the stock’s underperformance dropped it to the seventh-most valuable holding in his 13F portfolio. The position was left unchanged during the third quarter at an even 6 million shares, but lost $15 million of its value after shares fell by 14.5%. Numerous other funds bailed on Macy’s during Q3, as there was a 24% drop in ownership of the stock.Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M) has been a big winner for Tepper so far in Q4, with shares gaining close to 50%. The fashion retailer’s faltering sales growth has been driving off many investors, as same-store sales slumped by 1.5% yeae-over-year in Q2, which then accelerated to a 3% decline in Q3. The company does have some positives going for it though which could be enticing Tepper.Among other things, it’s done a good job managing its inventory levels ahead of the holiday season, an issue that has been plaguing numerous other retailers. That should ensure that Macy’s delivers solid profits during the holiday quarter, with the company raising its 2022 adjusted EPS forecast by $0.07 following the release of its Q3 results. Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M) also pays out an attractive dividend that currently yields 2.7%.6. EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT)Value of Appaloosa Management‘s 13F Position: $103 Million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 57 Closing out the first half of David Tepper’s stock portfolio is EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT), a holding which Tepper trimmed by 12% during Q3 to 2.53 million shares. Hedge fund ownership of EQT has risen for three straight quarters, climbing by 24% during that time. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital and Louis Navellier’s Navellier &amp; Associates were some of the funds to add EQT to their 13F portfolios during the third quarter.EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) is another energy company Tepper likes which has had blowout results in this year. EQT’s TTM revenue has skyrocketed to $12.4 billion from just $2.66 billion in 2020. TTM gross profit has hit $8.2 billion, compared to a loss of $627 million two years ago. Piper Sandler analyst Mark Lear has an ‘Overweight’ rating on EQT and raised his price target on the stock to $63 from $62 earlier this month, but notes that the industry’s capex could rise in the final quarter of this year and into 2023 given growing service costs.ClearBridge Investments Mid Cap Strategy is bullish on EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT)’s position in the natural gas space, as relayed in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also added natural gas company EQT (NYSE:EQT) in the energy sector. As one of the lowest-cost domestic producers, EQT stands to benefit from its position as a leading supplier of natural gas to a world suffering from critically low energy reserves. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and threats to hold natural gas exports hostage have spurred a surge in European energy prices, generating long-term agreements by European countries to purchase U.S. natural gas.This strong demand and elevated prices have helped EQT strengthen its balance sheet and position it to take advantage as opportunities emerge for natural gas to plug the gaps in the global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables.”See where Amazon.com, Inc.

It’s the day Starbucks for Life officially kicks off, providing Rewards App members with the chance to get game plays with every drink order (plays that can result in some big prizes or discounts!).See: 9 Costco Brand Items That Aren’t Worth the MoneyFind: If Your Credit Score Is Under 740, Make These 4 Moves NowAmong the prizes are bonus stars that can be applied towards free drinks and bakery goods, a cold brew kit, gift cards and even Delta Miles, the latter a part of Starbucks’ new partnership with the major airline. Also up for grabs this year are instant prizes for cafe items — and there are even challenges that customers can complete to get additional entries each day.What is Starbucks for Life?But the biggest prize of all is, of course, Starbucks for Life, which grants two lucky people a free treat every day for three decades. As the official game site explains it, “The winner will receive a daily credit for 30 years for one free food or beverage item at participating Starbucks stores in the U.S.”The game continues through Jan. 1, 2023, but, if you’re really angling for that free coffee for life prize, the truth is the odds are not really in your favor. There are only two game pieces awarding that top-tier item and, as Starbucks explained, 3,917,000 total game pieces will be doled out this season.Even so, Starbucks is feeling in the giving mood this month and there are still a number of other ways to save at the coffee chain in the next 31 days.Sign Up for Bonuses Via the Starbucks Rewards AppFirst and foremost, if you sign up for the Starbucks Rewards app (which you will need if you want to participate in the Starbucks for Life game), you’ll get extra star rewards for preloading money onto your account from a debit or credit card — or for linking a Starbucks gift card. Rather than one star for every dollar that is earned in a normal setting where you don’t use preloaded funds, adding money ahead of time will net two stars per dollar. It takes 150 stars to get a free drink and 50 stars for some baked goods, so that double boost will help bring you to the threshold quickly. If you’re going with friends, perhaps offer to buy their drinks in the app and let them square up later.Story continuesEarn Delta MilesIn October Starbucks announced a big partnership with Delta Airlines, giving loyal customers of both brands the chance to earn twice the rewards. As INC. noted, Delta has long had a relationship with the coffee giant, serving its brew on flights and in airport lounges. But this new partnership links the two company apps for customers’ benefit. Per INC., “If you’re a member of Delta’s SkyMiles and Starbucks’ Rewards programs, you can now link the two programs and earn one mile for every $1 you spend at Starbucks. And, if you buy Starbucks on a day that you’re traveling, you’ll earn double miles.”Bring in Your Red CupAs GOBankingRates previously reported, Starbucks launched its annual Red Cup Day on Nov. 17, providing customers with a free collectible and reusable cup for both cold and hot drinks. Any time someone purchased a holiday drink on that day only, they received the coveted Red Cup. But the fun doesn’t stop there. Bring in that cup every time you visit this month for the barista to pour your drink into, and you’ll get 10 cents off.Add Alerts for Special DealsAnother great benefit of having the Starbucks Rewards App is that the company will often send daily or weekly promotions and, if you have alerts set up, you’ll be the first to know about them. It might be the chance to earn extra bonus stars for promotions based on your shopping habits (i.e. earn 90 extra stars for ordering a Caramel Macchiato once a day for a week). The chain has often offered a “buy one, get one free” drink special during the holidays, too. However, no date has been given yet — so stay tuned to the app!Take Our Poll: How Has Inflation Impacted Your Holiday Shopping Plans?More: Earn Airline Miles Shopping at Starbucks Thanks to Delta Partnership — Learn HowIf you do participate in the Starbucks For Life game this month, here’s what you might be able to win:Starbucks for Life: 2 winners.Starbucks for 6 months: 25 winners.Starbucks for 1 month: 100 winners.Delta Air Lines flight certificates (2 round-trip domestic flights): 40 winners.1,000 bonus stars: 8,000 winners.500 bonus stars: 1,000 winners.150 bonus stars: 35,000 winners.Moccamaster coffee brewer: 20 winners.$50 Starbucks gift card: 1,000 winners.Cold brew kit: 100 winners.$1 off a handcrafted beverage coupon: 50,000 winners.Reserve tote: 2,000 winners.Ornament: 2,000 winners.More From GOBankingRates20 Genius Things Mark Cuban Says To Do With Your MoneyTake a Look Back: 2022 Year in ReviewThe 10 Best Cash Back Credit Cards for 20237 Ways To Know You're Ready To Start InvestingThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 4 Ways To Save at Starbucks in December, Including Possible Starbucks for Life Prize]"

If you want to see more of the best defensive stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Defensive Stocks to Buy Now.Defensive stocks are stocks that generate relatively stable performances regardless of the market cycle. Defensive stocks generally don't fall as much as the overall market in recessionary times and they might not do as well as the market in more expansionary times. Examples of defensive stocks are leading consumer staples that produce or sell necessities that are in demand throughout the market cycle. Other defensive stocks have very wide moats and substantial competitive advantages that allow them to largely maintain their financial performance during recessions.Given their relatively stable performances, many defensive stocks pay dividends that are pretty consistent. Many of the same defensive stocks have also raised their annual dividends for many consecutive years. If interested also check out 12 Best Consumer Staple Stocks.It should be noted that defensive stocks may not always remain defensive stocks because industries and company management constantly change. If an industry undergoes secular decline, defensive stocks can underperform. Similarly if a formerly defensive company's management decided to overpay for an acquisition, the stock might not do well either.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.2022 has been a challenging year in the market as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times to fight inflation. Although October's core inflation data has shown some positive signs that inflation could be peaking, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard recently said he thought interest rates might need to rise to 5% or higher and stay there until into 2024 before the U.S. central bank can begin to normalize its monetary policy again.Story continuesGiven the interest rate increases and the expected economic slowdown in 2023, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 17.5% year to date and the NASDAQ has declined 30.6% year to date.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Defensive Stocks to Buy Now, we took 12 stocks that have defensive qualities that have outperformed the S&amp;P 500's decline of 17.5% year to date in 2022.We then ranked the 12 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q3 2022.12 Best Defensive Stocks to Buy Now12.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart to Geus. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aart J. de Geus, Synopsys, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Good afternoon. I am happy to report that Synopsys completed an outstanding year with sustained forward momentum. Since about 4 years ago, we communicated our dual objectives of accelerating growth and expanding margin. Synopsys has delivered on and, in fact, exceeded those expectations. This is visible through over 60% revenue growth since that point, 11 percentage points higher non-GAAP operating margin and more than doubled EPS. This quarter, we also crossed the $5 billion annual revenue milestone. Simultaneously, we substantially evolved our product offering, expanded customer relationships and increased competitive differentiation. Building on this, we delivered another record year in fiscal '22. Revenue grew 21% to $5.08 billion, with double-digit growth in all product groups and across geographies. We further expanded non-GAAP operating margin to 33%, grew earnings by 30% and generated record cash flow of $1.7 billion. While semiconductor industry revenue growth has moderated, design activity remains robust. In addition, our term-based business model, with $7.1 billion of noncancelable backlog and a diversified customer base, all provide stability, resilience and forward momentum. While fully mindful of the macro dynamics around us, including the most recent U.S. government export restrictions, Synopsys is poised for strong results in fiscal '23. We intend to grow revenue 14% to 15%, continue to drive notable ops margin expansion and aim for approximately 16% non-GAAP earnings per share growth. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail. Looking at the landscape around us. Some of you have asked us why customers design activity remains solid throughout waves of the business cycle. Two reasons. First, the macro quest for smart everything devices and, with it, AI and big data infrastructure is unrelenting and expect it to drive a decade of strong semiconductor growth. Second, semiconductor and systems companies, be it traditional or new entrants, prioritize design engineering throughout economic cycle precisely to be ready to feel competitive new products when the market turns upward again. We've seen this dynamic consistently in past up and down markets and expect it to continue. Today, Synopsys aims to be a key engineering catalyst towards this smart everything world as our mission is to enable innovation at the critical interplay between semiconductors and software. Our customers are racing to differentiate along 3 axes: first, still higher complexity chips with massive compute capability; second, super tightly integrated systems of chips optimized for the software that will run on them; and third, increasing focus on security and safety across both software and hardware in virtually all vertical segments. Synopsys is uniquely positioned to address these challenges as we provide the most advanced and complete design and verification solutions available today, the leading portfolio of highly valuable semiconductor IP blocks and the broader set of software security testing solutions. In the past few years, we have introduced some truly groundbreaking innovations that radically advance how design is done. Let me begin the highlights with our DSO.ai artificial intelligence design solution. With already well over 100 commercial production design, it continues to deliver amazing results. Applied simultaneously to multiple steps of the design flow, DSO.ai reduces efforts for months to now weeks while also delivering superior performance and reduced power. Results reported by customers include 25% reduction in turnaround time and compute resources and up to 30% power reduction. With customers such as Samsung, Renesas, Intel, MediaTek, Sony and many others reporting impressive achievements, customer adoptions have accelerated across a wide range of process nodes and market verticals. In FY '22, the number of customers more than doubled, and we've already seen significant repeat orders and broadening proliferation. Seven out of the top 10 semiconductor companies have adopted DSO.ai for production design. Meanwhile, we're also extending machine learning capabilities across other EDA workloads from verification to test, to custom design. These next phase solutions are already in customers' hands, showing excellent impacts and promise. Central to the impact of DSO.ai are the powerful digital design solution engines underpinning it, specifically our Fusion Compiler products. It drove numerous competitive wins with accelerated proliferation for a wide variety of customers. Key adoptions range from the largest processor firms to influential systems companies, to major hyperscalers. Fusion Compiler is used in over 90% of advanced nodes down to 3 and 2 nanometer, with a majority exclusively using Synopsys. In Q4, cumulative customer tape-outs surpassed 1,000, more than doubling the combined total of FY '20 and '21. Our customer solutions also saw strong market momentum this year, continuing the drumbeat of competitive displacements. With options ranging from large semiconductor companies at advanced nodes to automotive to memory vendors, as we added more than 45 new logos this year, nearly one per week with double-digit revenue growth. To address the highly advanced chip mentioned earlier, multi-die system design, sometimes also called chiplet-based design, is opening a whole new era of silicon complexity. Having forecasted this a number of years ago, Synopsys now provides a differentiated multi-die solution that enables architecture, analysis, design and sign-off all integrated in one place. This includes our 3DIC Compiler solution and our industry-leading portfolio of state-of-the-art die-to-die interface IP. Today, we're already tracking more than 100 multi-die designs for a range of applications, including high-performance compute, data centers and automotive, seeing strong adoption of our broad solution. A notable example is achieving plan of record for multiple 3D stack designs at a very large, high-performance computing company as well as expanded deployment at a leading mobile customer. Meanwhile, the recently introduced UCIE protocol, short for Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express, has become the interconnect of choice for multi-die systems. Both our UCIE interface IP and HBM3 memory IP are at the forefront of enabling multi-die designs with multiple wins at Tier 1 customers. More broadly, third-party IP is a must-have for designs across the board. Our market-leading IP portfolio, by far the broadest in the industry, continues to drive significant adoption and growth. In fiscal '22, our IP business delivered another record year with more than 20% growth. We continue to see particularly strong demand in key markets such as high-performance compute, automotive and mobile, where the systems are driven by smart everything, high-speed secure connectivity and advanced process geometries. While maintaining technical leadership in IP for advanced process technologies, we delivered multiple IP products in the most advanced 3- and 4-nanometer process nodes to our customers in high-end mobile and HPC applications. Very strong adoption also of our automotive-grade IP solutions as cars are being rearchitected towards both electrification and autonomous driving. The acceleration of car electrification driven by urgent climate considerations notably drives a slew of new sensor, actuator and control chip designs. Our automotive solutions had outstanding growth. Today, we have engaged with hundreds of designs from more than 30 leading semiconductor providers, more than 10 OEMs and 3 of the top 4 Tier 1 suppliers. At the core of these systems is the intersection of hardware and software. To optimize the system, our customers must verify both the software in the context of the hardware and the hardware in context of the software. While verification is fundamentally an unbounded problem, our state-of-the-art simulation, emulation and prototyping products tackle these tough verification challenges at unparalleled speed with the fastest engine, highest capacity and lowest cost of ownership. Specifically, our hardware-based products delivered a record year with competitive momentum, adding more than 30 new logos and over 200 repeat orders. Moving now to software security, the critical nature of which continues to grow as management teams and Boards are keenly focused on ways to protect their companies and their customers from destructive cyber attacks. Our Software Integrity solution enables organizations to manage the security and quality of software across a wide range of industry verticals from semiconductor and systems to financial services, automotive, industrial, health and more. Industry groups such as Gartner and Forrester recognized Synopsys leadership. Gartner positions us at the top and farthest right of its Magic Quadrant, rating us highly for technology depth, breadth, consulting capabilities and vision. While this is the one area where we did see some impact from the macro environment in the quarter, revenue growth for the year accelerated over FY '21. Notably, we saw good progress with the go-to-market and product initiatives introduced last year. Our indirect channel partner business, for example, continues to ramp well by expanding our reach into customer groups and geographies that we haven't connected with in the past. We are building momentum with the goal of another significant increase in indirect sales in FY '23. On the product side, we expanded our offerings by launching 2 new SaaS services for static analysis and open source analysis integrated into our Polaris platform. We expect these SaaS capabilities to accelerate adoption and consumption of our solutions as they are particularly well suited to growth in the mid-market. Early customer reception has been quite positive. Our continually evolving and strengthening platform also provides more and more valuable insights to help companies drive increasingly robust top-down software risk management. In summary, Synopsys exceeded beginning-of-year targets and delivered a record fiscal '22 across all metrics with the additional spark of passing the $5 billion milestone. We enter FY '23 with excellent momentum and a resilient business model that provides stability and wherewithal to navigate market cycles. Notwithstanding some economic uncertainty, our customers are continuing to prioritize their chip system and software development investments to be ready with differentiated products at the next upturn. On our side, many game-changing innovations across our portfolio position as well to capitalize a decade of semiconductor importance and impact. Finally, our execution and operational management continue to drive growth and margin expansion, and we're particularly thankful to our employees around the world for their vitality and diligence throughout the year. One more comment. As you may have seen yesterday, we announced the appointment of Shelagh Glaser to become our new CFO on December 2. She's here with us today, listening in as we prepare to pass the torch from Trac in a few days. Before I pass the microphone to Trac for his review of fiscal '22, it's wonderful to say a heartfelt thank you for his contributions that helped build the company we are today. With 16 years on our team, 8 as Synopsys CFO, Trac is a cornerstone architect and execution leader of the strong results of the past year. During his tenure, he strengthened our fiscal discipline and acumen, engineered trusting and effective relationships with the other parts of the company and, most importantly, assembled and grew a great team that we will continue to build on. So it is all the more meaningful to voice our gratitude to Trac at the very moment that we pass this unique revenue milestone. Thank you, Trac. And now one more time, please give us your perspective on the state of Synopsys. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Trac Pham, Synopsys, Inc. - CFO [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you, Aart, for the -- those kind of words. It has been a privilege to serve as the CFO of Synopsys. I'm immensely grateful to be a part of this team, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished. While I'll miss the rich interactions with the Synopsys team and the investment community, I'll be here through the end of December to ensure a smooth transition. Synopsys is in a great position as reflected in strong results and outlook. FY '22 was an excellent year and featured record results in all key metrics, including revenue, non-GAAP earnings and operating cash flow. We continue to execute well and are confident in our business heading into FY '23 driven by our strong technology portfolio that is expanding customer commitments, robust chip and system design activity despite moderating semiconductor industry revenue growth and a resilient and stable time-based business model with $7.1 billion in noncancelable backlog. As a result, while the macro environment is stressed, we expect to grow revenue 14% to 15% and expand operating margin more than 100 basis points, driving non-GAAP EPS growth of approximately 16% in 2023. Let me provide some highlights of our full year 2022 results. We generated total revenue of $5.08 billion, up 21% over the prior year, with double-digit growth across all products and key geographies. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $3.9 billion and total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $3.4 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 33%. GAAP earnings per share were $6.29 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $8.90, up 30% over the prior year. Semiconductor &amp; System Design segment revenue was $4.6 billion driven by broad-based strength across all product groups and geographies. Adjusted operating margin was 35.3%. Software Integrity segment revenue was $466 million, up 18%, with adjusted operating margin up slightly to 10.1%. For 2023, even in light of some of the marginal macro-related impact in Q4 orders, we expect revenue growth to be within our 15% to 20% objective with increased adjusted operating margin. Turning to cash. Operating cash flow for the year was a record $1.7 billion reflecting our strong results, robust collections and approximately $100 million in early collections. We ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $1.57 billion and total debt of $21 million. During the year, we completed buybacks of $1.1 billion or 69% of free cash flow. Now to our targets, which reflects the impact from the recently announced export control regulations and assume no further changes for the year. Based on our current assessment, we expect quarterly revenue and non-GAAP EPS to steadily increase through the year. For fiscal year 2023, the full year targets are: revenue of $5.775 billion to $5.825 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $4.49 billion and $4.537 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $3.81 billion and $3.84 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin improvement of more than 100 basis points; non-GAAP tax rate of 18%; GAAP earnings of $7.68 to $7.86 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $10.28 to $10.35 per share; cash flow from operations of approximately $1.7 billion. Now to the targets for the first quarter: revenue between $1.34 billion and $1.37 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $1.033 billion and $1.053 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $875 million and $885 million; GAAP earnings of $1.89 to $2 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $2.48 to $2.53 per share. Our press release and financial supplement include additional targets and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. Finally, we are reiterating our long-term financial objectives of annual double-digit revenue growth, non-GAAP operating margin expansion of more than 100 basis points per year and non-GAAP EPS growth in the mid-teens range. In conclusion, we entered 2023 with excellent momentum and confidence, reflecting our innovative technology portfolio, ongoing design activity by our customers who continue to invest through semiconductor cycles and the stability and resilience of our time-based business model. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. ================================================================================ Questions and Answers -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [1] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Joe Vruwink with Baird. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joseph D. Vruwink, Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great, and let me just say, Trac, all my best wishes. It's been a pleasure working with you. Maybe I'll just start. It seems your customers are heading towards a demand environment that maybe is most akin to what we last saw in 2019. And if I just think about Synopsys in 2019, I think you grew your recurring revenue at a low double-digit pace. Your nonrecurring revenue was down at a high single-digit pace. I don't know. It seems both are probably trending better into 2022 than the last kind of down experience to the industry. Can you just compare and contrast similarities, differences? And maybe a little bit more detail on how those 2 revenue components might track next year? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aart J. de Geus, Synopsys, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, first, actually, I think your comparison is pretty good because '19 was really just sort of waving around the medium for the growth of the semiconductor industry. And so in that sense, I don't see a long-term change in the trajectory, which essentially forecast that for this decade, semiconductors are making it to $1 trillion, and we see all the reason why it will get there. The fact that some years are higher, others are slightly lower is just a given. And in a context like that, Synopsys has the good fortune to have a business model that is very stable and self-sustainable, but also a set of customers that have no interest in going up and down in their R&amp;D force because it's a continual investment over typically products that take 2 to 3 years to develop, and so I think we provide a good solidity in pretty much all the fronts. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Trac Pham, Synopsys, Inc. - CFO [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In general, Joe, but I'd also add that we're seeing just better momentum today than we did a few years back when you look at where our products are and with regards to the strength of the portfolio, how we're executing the changes that we're making and just the overall strength of the business. I think we're heading into an environment that may be stressed outside, but we're well positioned to grow there. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joseph D. Vruwink, Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Great. And then I was hoping maybe just reconcile some of the year-over-year changes with your cash flow outlook. Even, I guess, if I adjust for the $100 million in early collections, I think cash from operations is growing a bit more slowly than your core EBIT and earnings. And then there's -- it looks like a big step-up in CapEx. Maybe just what's behind that? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Trac Pham, Synopsys, Inc. - CFO [6] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So let me start with the cash from ops. The second thing in addition to the $100 million of early collections is the -- our cash flow projections reflect the change in the tax rules that now requires us to capitalize R&amp;D expense. And so as a result of that, cash taxes are going up in '23. So that affects the number. With regards to the CapEx, it's a little higher than it's been over the last couple of years, primarily because of our efforts to consolidate space and our facilities in the U.S., mostly to drive better productivity in the employee base going forward. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [7] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We'll take our next question from Gal Munda with Wolfe Research. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gal Munda, Joh. Berenberg, Gossler &amp; Co. KG, Research Division - Former Co-Head of Technology Research &amp; Banks Analyst [8] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Trac, congratulations on your last quarterly call as well. I hope you enjoy your retirement. The first one is just I wanted to focus a little bit on the DSO.ai. You mentioned, Aart, that you've doubled the amount of customers in '22. My question is, how early are you in that potential to penetrate the customer base, especially the ones that move the needle in the matter and within the ones that already adopted? Do you feel it's just the beginning from them in terms of being productive? Or do you think there's still a lot of room to sell deeper into those accounts? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aart J. de Geus, Synopsys, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO [9] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think there's a lot of room. As a matter of fact, I think that the whole AI-driven design wave is easily the next decade because it fundamentally changes so many things at the very moment that the customers, one way or another, are going to grow complexity dramatically because they see so many opportunities in this notion of smart everything. And so in order to do that, you don't want to just have tools that use AI and be better and faster and so on, you want actually to impact the very design flow. And to me, the big breakthrough in DSO.ai felt very similar, as a matter of fact, as some 30 years plus ago, synthesis, it changed how things are happening. Now in that sense, the adoption will, on one hand, take time; on the other hand, I think is very fast. Literally just a couple of days ago, among the team, we were discussing how do we manage the number of people that have interest because they all want support, they all want to be the first ones, and it's a good problem to have. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gal Munda, Joh. Berenberg, Gossler &amp; Co. KG, Research Division - Former Co-Head of Technology Research &amp; Banks Analyst [10] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- That's very interesting. And then just as a follow-up, you mentioned automotive solutions and the OEMs as well coming in, both from a semi companies and the OEMs kind of increasing demand, and that's kind of driving part of the growth. I guess if I do math and I think about your growth vectors today, I'm thinking maybe specifically about next year when you look at your pipeline, how does the reliance on the core semis, the leading-edge companies, compare to the systems companies in terms of the growth? Who's bearing the higher proportion of growth in terms of responsibility to kind of deliver those targets that are pretty impressive? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aart J. de Geus, Synopsys, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO [11] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, I'm glad you bring up automotive because looking at the numbers, I was surprised myself how well we had done this year. At the same time, I think there's some good explanations for it. For starters, the very fact that there was a supply shortage in automotive, suddenly everybody gets full attention of automotive. And then simultaneously, the world has now recognized that the cost of climate change is upon us. And I expect that the rate of change toward electrification is absolutely going to accelerate. And so investments that started probably 7, 8 years ago. And we always said, oh, automotive is so slow, is so slow. Now suddenly are moving forward very fast, and it's along the entire supply chain that is reconfiguring itself around new architectures. So I think there's a lot of opportunity, a lot of challenges there as well, but I think we're in a great position for it. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [12] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We'll take our next question from Jason Celino with KeyBanc. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jason Vincent Celino, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [13] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Trac, It's been an absolute pleasure. Bad with goodbyes, so hopefully, this is just a see you later. The 14% growth guidance is very impressive, especially the year that you are coming out of -- I'm curious, though, with the upfront business having a tough comp, you did 40% growth there this year. How much of upfront or hardware, I'm using those terms kind of interchangeably, are you kind of taking into the guidance for '23? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Trac Pham, Synopsys, Inc. - CFO [14] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I would naturally attach hardware to upfront. Of course, it will show up in online. But keep in mind that we do have IP that is reflected in that category as well. And keep -- remember, in our statement, we -- our IP business grew over 20% in '22. So heading in '23, really the 14% to 15% guide for revenue growth is coming across all product areas. And that's where we're -- that's all product areas and all key geographies, and so that's where the confidence and the comfort is in terms of our ability to execute against that plan. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jason Vincent Celino, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst [15] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Excellent. And then DSO.ai, it seems that you're getting a lot of traction there, and you mentioned some other areas where you're looking at AI capabilities like verification tests and customs. Can you kind of talk about this road map and where we are with deployments and how customers are using it towards some of these other applications? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aart J. de Geus, Synopsys, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO [16] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sure. I'll be a little careful with giving too much of the road map. But I want to make sure that you understand that in all of these areas, we have worked on those now for already quite a while, and we have a number of very positive results directly with customers. And at the end of the day, it's like the old the VC,, feed the dog, dog food, not that I would ever want to compare customers to dogs, of course. But the fact is, it's in the field that you realize what are the issues that one may not have contemplated. And the feedback is very positive because there, too, while the tools have long been optimized with a variety of machine learning and AI capabilities, changing the very workflow is how you get a more profound impact. And so we have a long opportunity space to grow into, but the engagement already signifies that we have results that customers want to keep and turn into production. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [17] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Harlan Sur, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [18] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Congratulations on the solid results and outlook. And Trac, best of luck, and thanks for all the support. As you guys pointed out, chip design activity in leading-edge digital is very strong, where you have accelerated compute processors, next-gen networking, switching and routing ships, new ASIC programs. Very strong, but also significant increase in design complexity and more importantly, chip design cycle times. Aart, I'm wondering is the complexity and cycle time dynamic requiring your customers to use hardware emulation and prototyping as an integral part of the verification and software development process versus it being somewhat discretionary 5, 10 years ago? And is this what's helping to sustain the hardware growth into next year? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aart J. de Geus, Synopsys, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO [19] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The answer is yes. And another yes. Yes, it does require much more attention to the intersection of hardware and software. And in order to do that, you need simulation that is blindingly fast, and that's why you use hardware accelerators or we call them emulators or prototyping to be able to do that. But underneath your question, there was another comment, which is really the comment that is it true that complexity still is increasing massively, and the answer is very true, but it's going to be in a new form, meaning it's not one chip, it's multiple chips as close as possible, and it is architectures dedicated to whatever the end markets are. And so the race is absolutely on in all of these dimensions, but it brings a challenge for our customers that by now after many, many decades, have certainly learned how to optimize for performance and power. They now have to optimize for making it all work: multiple chips, hardware and software, thermal issues. And that complexity is going to drive all kinds of new products on our side, but also necessitates to look to have focus on the entire flow. And that's why I'm very encouraged by being at the dawn of really multiple new decades of new technology. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Harlan Sur, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst [20] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And then on your IP business, we've got Intel and AMD, they're now starting to roll out their new processor chips, right, supporting next-gen memory and storage interfaces, right? Strong area for you guys, right? DDR5 from memory, PCI Gen 5, CXL for storage. These processors are starting to roll out now. Additionally, you have more of your customers bringing on additional foundries as a part of their diversification and reshoring efforts. I think this should drive higher adoption of your foundational IP as well. So what are the other dynamics that are going to drive the IP business next year? And does this segment continue at strong double-digit year-over-year growth in fiscal '23? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aart J. de Geus, Synopsys, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO [21] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, we'll take 1 year at a time, but there's no doubt that there's an opportunity to continue to grow very well. And a greater respect for you mentioning all the keywords of things that we sell. I would add one other category that we alluded to, which is a category that actually looks at the new types of interfaces in these multi-die integrations because those integrations are predicated mostly on one thing: how short and how fast can you make the wires between the chips? And therefore, it's another form of miniaturization with enormous connectivity between chips. And so these connectors are extremely sensitive to the speed, the voltage and all these things. And so there, too, we are leading in providing the IP that makes this possible. And I think that's an area that will grow on top of what you mentioned. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [22] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We'll take our next question from Charles Shi with Needham &amp; Company. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yu Shi, Needham &amp; Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [23] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I think first question I want to ask is about China. This has been or maybe had been a major bear case on your stock, at least over the last 3, 4 months, and especially after the very, I mean, unprecedented round of restrictions that the U.S. implemented since the beginning of October. I understand you did qualify that the impact is not material, but it seems to me that investors may still be a little bit skeptical. And maybe can you just give us some sense from your perspective why -- what do you see as a reality being nonmaterial versus what the perception among the investment community is being like a China restriction being a major, major bear case for you? Is there any way that you can provide us some perspective why that has been the case? And what do you think that should help investors to really change or, I mean, have a more grounded view about this issue? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aart J. de Geus, Synopsys, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO [24] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It's a very good question, and I understand why it's difficult because a lot of these things are written in terms of hard to understand technology. And so of course, whenever there's a change, we look solidly at all the changes, assess the impact. And actually, I think we explicitly communicated that our assessment showed that it was not material in the financial terms. We highlight that we have factored in, to the best of our ability, exactly what the situation is today in our forecast. And moreover, we have put a lot of emphasis on making sure that we are 100% compliant with all the rules so that we act in a clean fashion. I would add only one more thing, which is China is a very broad market, and so there are many technologies that are not anywhere close to being touched by the advanced restrictions. So we see continued great opportunity, but we understand with you that it's an area to keep watching and to make sure that we grow in other parts of the world as well. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yu Shi, Needham &amp; Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst [25] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Maybe the second question, maybe this is for you, Trac. First off, congratulations on the retirement done. But I want to ask you, I think 1 year ago, when you gave the guidance about fiscal '22, you kind of guided fiscal '22, maybe like first half, slightly first half loaded over second half. But your fiscal '23 guidance, if I hear you correctly, you're guiding second half likely to be higher than first half. And your number seems to imply that every quarter needs to be somewhere 4% to 5% higher than the preceding quarters throughout the entire '23. I wonder where exactly the assumptions there for steady growth into the year and that you have assumptions like maybe the semiconductor industry needs to have a rebound or recovery out of the downturn to the second half of your fiscal year. And if possible, can you give us some color what exactly driving the second half rebound, I mean the growth into the second half? Which one will be the primary driver. It's EDA? Is it IP? Is it hardware? Or is it the SIG part of the business? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Trac Pham, Synopsys, Inc. - CFO [26] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sure, Charles. Let me zoom out a little bit because over the last couple of years, we've had some unusual profiles coming into the year, right? So 2020 was very back end -- '21 was back-end loaded. Heading into '22, we said it would be very front-end loaded. When we look at the profile this year, keep in mind that it's based on backlog that we have scheduled out for our software business, IP and hardware. So there's good visibility into how it lays out throughout the year. And when you look at the profile, you're right, it's slightly to the back half, but just marginally so. And if you look at the first half comparison -- first half, second half comparison for '23 and you go back in time, it's just actually in line with what we have historically seen, which is kind of unusual but nice to get back to that profile. And it does imply that there is incremental increases in the business as we progress throughout the year. The basis for the forecast, as I said, is grounded very much on visibility of the backlog, but also what we expect to book in the year. And we are playing the year based on what we can execute, similar to what we have said in the past. So it's not a stretch to assume that it's dependent on major market forces or anything out of our control. We want to give guidance in terms of the outlook for the business, both top line and bottom line. That really is heavily dependent on our ability to execute. And at this point, given our visibility, the portfolio that we have and the -- our confidence in our execution, we feel really good about the 14% to 15% growth and driving 16% EPS growth. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [27] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We'll take our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jay Vleeschhouwer, Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD of Software Research [28] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aart, for you first, a products question since the term road map came up a couple of times. I'm wondering if there is some potential development of catalysts that you might be able to bring to market. For example, would it make any sense or would it be feasible for you to increasingly connect SIG with hardware-based prototyping? Along the lines of an earlier question, you haven't mentioned silicon life cycle management or SLM, but would it make some sense there to connect it increasingly to your sign-off business and so forth and other kinds of intracompany integrations that could be differentiators or new catalysts for product growth? And then my final question for Trac. With regard to SIG, could you comment on the results that you've been seeing for your investments in international expansion for SIG over the last number of years, including, in particular, your investments in security consulting outside of the U.S.? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aart J. de Geus, Synopsys, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO [29] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So let me zoom out a little bit on your question because generically, I think you're pushing absolutely on the right buttons, which is that while many of the things we've done in the past have been sort of point efforts, point tools and so on, for the last decade, we have started to integrate many tools more forcefully together because that's the only way of solving problems of complexity where power and speed and thermal and locations and reliability strongly intersect. Then if you move to the next level up, we have already mentioned the fact that there are strong interconnectivity between software and hardware because the hardware has one mission: make the software faster. And the software has one mission: make the hardware work harder for it. And so these optimizations are already going hand-in-hand. SIG adds an additional angle to that, is the angle of security and quality. And we have, by the way, sort of the equivalent of a SIG inside of the EDA side as well and the IP side because in the IP, we have a variety of security capabilities being built in. I think it will take a little bit of time before you can see sort of a strong connectivity between those, but it has not taken that much time to see at a number of customers that they start to recognize that our vision moves up into the domain of software and moves down into the hardware at the very moment that they are learning about this. And the earlier mentioned automotive, but it could also be industrial and a few other segments, are precisely now arriving at this junction or figuring out that they have to make it all work at the same time. And so while many of the specific things that we're working on, we'll talk about as we release them, the general direction of your question, I think, is very much the way we think about systemic complexity now being the hallmark of the next decade. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Trac Pham, Synopsys, Inc. - CFO [30] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jay, this is Trac. So to your question regarding SIG and international expansion, you're right, that was a really intentional focus for us a couple of years ago in terms of improving the go-to-market function, both internationally but -- both internationally and with channel partners. And I would say that when you look at the results over the last couple of years, I think we've made really good progress with regards to how we're executing internationally and the additions and the execution with new channel partners. I'm optimistic not only because of the results has been good, but we're in the early stages of actually seeing strong results from that. So I think there's a lot of progress ahead of us and a lot of opportunities ahead of us in both those areas. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [31] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We will take our last question from Ruben Roy with Stifel, Nicolaus. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ruben Roy, Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD &amp; Equity Research Analyst [32] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Trac, congrats from me as well. Thanks for all the support over the years. I guess Trac or Aart, one thing I wanted to just touch base on again is on the SIG business. Aart, you mentioned that you did see some impact from the macro during the quarter. The numbers look pretty good. I've got you down for 16% year-over-year growth. So maybe if you could just expand on that. Was that towards the latter end of the quarter and looking ahead or any other detail you can give us, please? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aart J. de Geus, Synopsys, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO [33] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sure. Well, first, I do think that the results were quite good. What we did see -- and it probably started a little earlier than this quarter that some of the negotiations turned out to be a bit longer, maybe some more layers of approval. And actually, that is very, very common when you see economy looking at, well, is it going to be a recession or not, are people a little bit worried. Well, they just start putting some breaks on the decision-making first and foremost. But at the same time, we were encouraged by the fact that growth continues to improve over the previous year. And there's no doubt in our mind that this is a very good part of Synopsys and there's a lot of opportunity, so we'll keep pushing. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ruben Roy, Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD &amp; Equity Research Analyst [34] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Great. And then a quick follow-up. On the DSO.ai, you mentioned, Aart, that that's -- you started gaining traction across a wide range of process nodes, which is interesting to me. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the value prop across those nodes, proposition across those nodes? Is it power reduction for some, reduction in turnaround time for others? Or how does that work? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aart J. de Geus, Synopsys, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO [35] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. Well, the first one, it is turnaround time reduction for everybody. And that in itself is interesting because if you remember my other comments about moving into a whole different league of complexity, while people will continue to push on performance and power, right now, they're pushing on making just sure that they can finish the job. And in that context, improving the turnaround time is extremely valuable. But the other thing is that in many areas, it opens the doors that they didn't have before. Because if you can work in multiple nodes, the question is, can you also start to translate from one node into another? And we have, in the last 12 months, specifically, seen more and more really outstanding experiments and showcases where we helped people move from one node and design in, let's say, the next node or even some nodes that are quite different from the ones where they started with the benefit of the learning from the original node. And I think that opens a fertile space because in reality, most design is redesigned. You try to always use what you did in the past. And the question is, how easy is that when the past becomes more and more complex? And that's where AI, I think, has a lot of potential going forward. So sometimes you call that retargeting or remastering, and I think there's going to be a lot of need for that. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [36] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call over to Aart de Geus for closing comments. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aart J. de Geus, Synopsys, Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman &amp; CEO [37] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, first and foremost, thank you for all the support and the good questions over the last year. I think we concluded a very strong year. Of course, again, it's a very strong market, but I think we also demonstrated that there's momentum going forward. And so that '23, even without Trac, will be a good year for us. And we thank Trac one more time. We also thank you for your support and for your continuing support of our stock. With that, have a great rest of the year, and we'll talk to you soon. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator [38] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you. And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.]"

Accordingly, Synopsys presents non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Synopsys' operating results in a manner that focuses on what Synopsys believes to be its core business operations and what Synopsys uses to evaluate its business operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. These non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Synopsys' management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, superior to, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Synopsys' management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP financial measures that include: (i) the amortization of acquired intangible assets, (ii) the impact of stock compensation, (iii) acquisition-related items, (iv) restructuring charges, (v) the effects of certain settlements, final judgments and loss contingencies related to legal proceedings, and (vi) the income tax effect of non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments; and the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude such information in order to assess the performance of Synopsys' business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods.Synopsys adopted a three-year normalized non-GAAP tax rate of 16% for fiscal years 2019 through 2021 in calculating non-GAAP financial measures to provide better consistency across interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring and period-specific items, which can vary in size and frequency and do not necessarily reflect our normal operations, and to more closely align our tax rate with our expected geographic earnings mix.Synopsys adopted an annual non-GAAP tax rate of 18% for fiscal year 2022 and given uncertainty surrounding further U.S. corporate tax law changes, has elected to maintain a non-GAAP tax rate of 18% for fiscal year 2023 rather than adopt a three-year normalized non-GAAP tax rate in calculating its non-GAAP financial measures. This annual non-GAAP tax rate is based on an evaluation of its historical and projected mix of U.S. and international profit before tax, taking into account the impact of non-GAAP adjustments, U.S. tax law changes, as well as other factors such as its current tax structure, existing tax positions and expected recurring tax incentives. Synopsys re-evaluates this rate on a periodic basis for any significant events that could materially affect its projections, such as significant changes in its geographic earnings mix or significant tax law changes in major jurisdictions where Synopsys operates, and will further consider the appropriateness of adopting a multi-year normalized non-GAAP tax rate.

Product innovation plays a significant role in MNST's success. Its actions, including price increases, reducing reliance on imported cans and moving production closer to markets to mitigate the ongoing cost pressures, bode well.Backed by the aforementioned tailwinds, MNST posted better-than-expected earnings in the quarter, while its top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, sales improved 15.2% year over year, driven by continued strong demand for the energy drinks category. On a currency-adjusted basis, net sales rose 20.2%. Net sales to customers outside the United States rose 15.8% to $610.6 million, representing about 38% of the total net sales. On a currency-adjusted basis, sales to customers outside the United States improved 29.3%.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 12.3% in the past three months, outperforming the industry and the Consumer Staples sector’s growth of 5.3% and 2.9%, respectively. The stock performance also compared favorably against the S&amp;P 500’s fall of 0.4% in the same period.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Monster Beverage’s 2022 sales suggests growth of 15.2% from the year-ago period’s reported number, while earnings estimates indicate a decline of 11.3%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors to Aid GrowthMonster Beverage, which primarily markets and distributes energy drinks and alternative beverages, is a key beneficiary of the recent consumer awareness of health drinks. This has led to strength in its energy drink category, particularly the Monster Energy brand. We note that MNST offers a wide range of energy drinks brands such as Monster Energy, Java Monster, Cafe Monster, Espresso Monster, Monster Energy Mule, Juice Monster Pipeline Punch, Juice Monster Pacific Punch, Juice Monster Mango Loco, Monster Ultra Paradise and Monster Hydra Sport.Management is optimistic about the strength in the global energy drinks category. It remains poised to gain from growth in the Monster Energy family of brands, and strength in Strategic and Affordable energy brands in the long run.Monster Beverage also remains committed to product launches and innovation to boost growth. In third-quarter 2022, the company launched several products and expanded distribution in international markets.The company is on track to launch Monster Energy Zero Sugar in fourth-quarter 2022, initially in the United States. Monster Energy Zero Sugar is developed to provide a zero-sugar variant of its original Monster Energy Green flavor. Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton Zero Sugar Energy Drink is likely to enter select EMEA markets in the fourth quarter of 2022, with a rollout to 20 additional markets in the first quarter of 2023.In the first half of 2023, MNST plans to launch pure unflavored water, namely Monster Tour Water, in the United States in still and sparkling variants. The company intends to launch Rainstorm in 4 flavors in the first half of 2023. The company is optimistic about the launch of its first flavored malt beverage alcohol product, known as ‘The Beast Unleashed.’Gains from the CANarchy acquisition, and a robust line-up of product launches for alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks make it well-placed for long-term growth.Monster Beverage continues to stand by its strategy to ensure product availability and solidify the continued long-term growth of its brands despite the ongoing supply-chain challenges. Some of the actions taken to navigate through the challenges are decreasing the company’s reliance on imported cans.The company is currently purchasing aluminum cans from local sources in both the United States and EMEA. It expects the increased use of domestic cans to result in a reduction in the cost of sales over the next few quarters.Additionally, Monster Beverage is implementing pricing actions to overcome the ongoing cost pressures. In third-quarter 2022, the company remained on track with the mitigation of higher production and distribution costs through pricing actions and lower promotional expenses. It implemented price increases for its products in the United States on Sep 1, 2022. The company also brought effective price increases in certain international markets in the third quarter. Some of these will be in addition to price increases already implemented earlier this year in order to mitigate inflationary cost pressures.Story continuesHurdles to OvercomeHigher freight rates and fuel costs have been hurting Monster Beverage’s gross and operating margins for a while, which persisted in the third quarter as well. Inflationary operational costs for aluminum cans, shipping, freight and other inputs dented the company’s bottom line in the third quarter of 2022. In the quarter, the company continued to experience additional global supply-chain challenges, including the lack of adequate shipping containers, which resulted in shortages of certain ingredients and finished products.Monster Beverage has been witnessing significant increases in the cost of sales, which have been majorly impacting the gross profit and the gross margin rate. Higher logistics costs, increased aluminum-can costs, unfavorable geographical and product sales, elevated ingredients, and other input costs, comprising secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees, hurt the cost of sales in the third quarter.In addition to the aforementioned factors, Monster Beverage experienced a significant rise in distribution expenses, including increased fuel, freight and warehousing costs. This hurt operating expenses.Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Coca-Cola FEMSA KOF, Ambev ABEV and General Mills Inc.

(NYSE:ABBV) contributing to a stellar valuation that is expected to increase to $1.7 trillion in value by 2030. The healthcare industry is also one of the safest picks for a retirement stock portfolio. This is indicated by the historical performance of the sector during times of crisis. A recent Endpoint survey reveals that 66% of investors think that biotech will outperform the broader market in 2022. When viewed in context of rising rates and soaring inflation, two factors that have pummeled the market and slowed growth in recent months, these sentiments highlight the reputation of the health industry among elite investors. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the healthcare sector and have established business models that have demonstrated historical resilience against inflationary headwinds were selected for the list. We preferred companies that either pay strong dividends or are working on projects with long-term growth prospects. These stocks are also popular among the 920 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of the third quarter. Retirement Stock Portfolio: Safe Healthcare Stocks to Consider11.

TDOC’s platform enables an ever-expanding list of patient-doctor interactions (including those for primary health care, mental health issues and chronic condition management) to transition from an on-site visit to one that can be done remotely with full video- based interaction. TDOC provides its platform of services on both a business-to-business and direct-to-consumer basis, through monthly subscription-based relationships.

The company’s 2022 guidance was in line with Street expectations, calling for 9% to 11% operational revenue growth and modest margin expansion despite heavy investment in core growth drivers.”7.

It has a strong market presence in highly attractive geographies with growing populations and low unemployment, such as Texas and Florida, which leads to a favorable payor mix. We are further attracted to its strong management team that has a stellar track record of deploying capital, and the founding family continues to own almost a quarter of the business. We initiated a position after HCA reported Q1 earnings — it reduced full year guidance due to increased labor costs and lower-than-expected acuity among COVID admissions, dampening near-term investor sentiment.”6. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67  CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) provides health services in the United States. It is one of the prominent healthcare stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On November 2, CVS Health Corp declared that its adjusted profit will be in the range of $8.70 to $8.90 per share in 2023.

(NYSE:PFE), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is one of the best healthcare stocks to consider for a retirement stock portfolio. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Vltava Fund, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.” Click to continue reading and see Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Healthcare Stocks to Consider. Suggested Articles:10 Best Biotech Stocks To BuyObama Stock Portfolio: 10-Year Returns11 Best Covid Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

107,58834d41-edb7-3f2f-9eba-d8c28ef19b18,SLB,2022-12-01,Should You Buy Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) For Its Upcoming Dividend?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-schlumberger-limited-nyse-slb-103527929.html,1669890927,STORY,['SLB'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Therefore, if you purchase Schlumberger's shares on or after the 6th of December, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 12th of January.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.17 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.70 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Schlumberger stock has a trailing yield of around 1.4% on the current share price of $51.55. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether Schlumberger can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Fortunately Schlumberger's payout ratio is modest, at just 28% of profit. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Schlumberger generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It distributed 42% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's positive to see that Schlumberger's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. This is why it's a relief to see Schlumberger earnings per share are up 4.4% per annum over the last five years. Recent earnings growth has been limited. Yet there are several ways to grow the dividend, and one of them is simply that the company may choose to pay out more of its earnings as dividends.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Schlumberger has seen its dividend decline 4.4% per annum on average over the past 10 years, which is not great to see. It's unusual to see earnings per share increasing at the same time as dividends per share have been in decline. We'd hope it's because the company is reinvesting heavily in its business, but it could also suggest business is lumpy.The Bottom LineShould investors buy Schlumberger for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share growth has been growing somewhat, and Schlumberger is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends. This is interesting for a few reasons, as it suggests management may be reinvesting heavily in the business, but it also provides room to increase the dividend in time. It might be nice to see earnings growing faster, but Schlumberger is being conservative with its dividend payouts and could still perform reasonably over the long run. There's a lot to like about Schlumberger, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.While it's tempting to invest in Schlumberger for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. For example - Schlumberger has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

108,c981ede9-0c52-357c-ad85-50d71a4cfd67,LEG,2022-12-01,Why Is Legget & Platt (LEG) Up 5.7% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-legget-platt-leg-5-163004534.html,1669825804,STORY,['LEG'],"[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Legget &amp; Platt (LEG). Shares have added about 5.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Legget &amp; Platt due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Leggett's Q3 Earnings Beat, Tepid ViewsLeggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated reported better than expected results for third-quarter 2022, wherein earnings and net sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, both metrics decreased on a year-over-year basis.Despite experiencing demand and margin recovery in the Specialized Products segment, net sales declined due to a stable U.S. bedding market and slowness in other markets such as European bedding, home furniture, work furniture, and steel.President and CEO of Leggett, Mitch Dolloff, said, ""Third quarter earnings per share were slightly better than expected primarily due to incentive compensation adjustments. At the midpoint of guidance, fourth quarter is now expected to be slightly lower than third quarter primarily due to further reductions in steel rod production in response to the slowing steel market.”Quarter in DetailsLeggett reported adjusted earnings of 52 cents per share, which topped the consensus estimate of 49 cents by 6.1% but decreased 26.8% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of 71 cents. Global economic conditions and their effect on the consumer affected the bottom line.Net trade sales totaled $1.29 billion, surpassing the consensus mark of $1.23 billion by 5.1% but declined 2% from the prior-year quarter’s levels. Organic sales were down 3% year over year. Raw material-related selling prices added 8% to sales growth and Hydraulic Cylinders and Textile acquisitions (completed in August), net of small divestitures, contributed 1% to the positives. Yet, a volume decline of 8% and a currency impact of 3% offset the positives.Adjusted EBIT declined 21% from the prior-year quarter’s levels to $113.2 million. The downside was caused due to volume declines and lower overhead absorption from reduced production, and operational inefficiencies in Specialty Foam, partially offset by metal margin expansion.Adjusted EBIT margin contracted 220 basis points (bps) to 8.7% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Adjusted EBITDA margin also declined 230 bps to 12.2%.Story continuesSegment DetailsNet trade sales in Bedding Products (excluding intersegment sales) decreased 12% from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $582 million. A volume decline of 20% was caused by softness in the United States and European demand, partially offset by strong trade demand in Steel Rod and Drawn Wire businesses. Increased prices contributed 9% despite a 1% decline from currency fluctuation. Organically, sales were down 12% year over year.Adjusted EBIT margin fell 470 bps at 7.5%. Adjusted EBITDA margin also fell 430 bps year over year to 12%.The Specialized Products segment's trade sales rose 24% from the prior-year quarter’s figure to $291.3 million. Sales growth in Automotive, Aerospace and Hydraulic Cylinders helped volume increase by 22%. Favorable selling price added 5% to sales and Hydraulic Cylinders acquisition contributed 5%. Currency impact lowered sales by 8%. Organically, sales were up 19% year over year.EBIT margin improved 120 bps to 10.7%. Adjusted EBITDA margin plunged 40 bps year over year to 14.1%.Trade sales in the Furniture, Flooring &amp; Textile Products segment remained flat from the prior-year quarter’s level to $421.1 million. Volume was down 6%, mainly due to declines in Home Furniture, Fabric Converting and Flooring, more than offset by growth in Geo Components and Work Furniture. Raw material-related selling price added 7% to sales, but currency declined sales 1%. Organically, sales were flat year over year.EBIT margin of 9.1% was down 70 bps from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin also contracted 80 bps to 10.4%.FinancialsAs of Sep 30, 2022, the company had $1 billion in liquidity. It had $226.2 million of cash and equivalents in September-end compared with $361.7 million at 2021-end. Long-term debt at the third quarter-end was $2.13 billion, up from $1.79 from 2021-end. The trailing 12-month net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 2.63.Cash from operations for the third quarter totaled $65 million versus $50 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $25 million in the third quarter.At the end of the third quarter, it had 132.6 million outstanding under the repurchase program as it bought back 0.1 million shares from its common stock for an average price of $38.42.Q4 GuidanceFor the fourth quarter, net sales are expected to be $1.15–$1.25 billion and earnings per share are anticipated to be between 42 cents and 57 cents. In fourth-quarter 2021, it reported net sales of $1.333 billion and earnings per share of 77 cents.2022 GuidanceOwing to the lower demand levels and challenging macroeconomic environment, Leggett lowered its 2022 guidance on Oct 10.Leggett now expects sales in the range of $5.1–$5.2 billion versus $5.2–$5.4 billion expected earlier. This indicates year-over-year flat to 2% growth from 2-6% estimated earlier. The raw material-related price increase, net of currency impact, is likely to offset high single-digit volume decline. Sales are likely to be down mid-teens in Bedding Products, up low double digits in Specialized Products and down by low single digits in Furniture, Flooring &amp; Textile Products segment. Acquisitions, net of small divestitures, are expected to add nearly 1% to sales.Earnings are now expected to be between $2.30 and $2.45 per share, down from a prior expectation of $2.65-$2.80. The company now expects an EBIT margin of 9.5-10% (lower than the previous projection of 10.5-10.7%).Capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization costs, and operating cash flow are estimated at $115 million, $180 million, and $400–450 million versus $130 million, $200 million, and $550–600 million expected earlier, respectively. Dividend and net interest expenses are likely to be $230 million and $80 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year is projected at 23%. Fully diluted shares are projected to be approximately 137 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted -5.88% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Legget &amp; Platt has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B.

If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company value investors might notice is Phillips 66 (PSX). PSX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value.Investors will also notice that PSX has a PEG ratio of 0.39. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. PSX's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.48. Over the past 52 weeks, PSX's PEG has been as high as 1.06 and as low as 0.39, with a median of 0.63.Another notable valuation metric for PSX is its P/B ratio of 1.53. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. PSX's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.08. Over the past year, PSX's P/B has been as high as 2.40 and as low as 1.15, with a median of 1.69.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. PSX has a P/S ratio of 0.31. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.32.Story continuesFinally, investors should note that PSX has a P/CF ratio of 4.31. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 5.23. PSX's P/CF has been as high as 33.65 and as low as 3.23, with a median of 9.42, all within the past year.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Phillips 66 is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, PSX sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this oil refiner have returned +1.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, which Phillips 66 falls in, has gained 7.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Phillips 66 is expected to post earnings of $5.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +81.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +36.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.39 points to a change of +257.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +14.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.26 indicates a change of -25.2% from what Phillips 66 is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +29.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Phillips 66 is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PSX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Phillips 66, the consensus sales estimate of $40.97 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +22%. The $172.66 billion and $149.94 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +50.3% and -13.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhillips 66 reported revenues of $48.76 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +54.9%. EPS of $6.46 for the same period compares with $3.18 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +32.49%. The EPS surprise was +29.72%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Phillips 66 is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Phillips 66. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

129,309fb88e-e265-3f1a-91ec-caf9199bb7cb,PEG,2022-12-01,"With 72% institutional ownership, Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE:PEG) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/72-institutional-ownership-public-enterprise-113304187.html,1669894384,STORY,['PEG'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE:PEG), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 72% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Public Service Enterprise Group, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Public Service Enterprise Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Public Service Enterprise Group. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Public Service Enterprise Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Public Service Enterprise Group. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.9% and 6.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Public Service Enterprise GroupThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$56m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 28% stake in Public Service Enterprise Group. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Public Service Enterprise Group better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Public Service Enterprise Group (2 are concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Shares have added about 3.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PSEG due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.PSEG Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues Rise Y/YPSEG reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted operating earnings of 86 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents by 2.4%.The company reported quarterly GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of 22 cents in the third quarter of 2022 against a loss of $3.10 generated in the third quarter of 2021.Total RevenuesOperating revenues came in at $2,272 million in the third quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,258.7 million by 0.6%.

Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, PSEG has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerPSEG is part of the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry. Over the past month, American Electric Power (AEP), a stock from the same industry, has gained 6.9%.

More like a penny for hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Indeed, parents may want to be extra careful next time they empty out their kids’ piggy banks. They might just be holding a fortune in the form of what appears to be a mere cent. This isn’t news among seasoned collectors. A quick search on eBay for collectible pennies turns up more than 1,900 results as of Wednesday, Nov. 30.See: Have Any $200 Quarters Lying Around? It’s Worth Checking Your Spare ChangeExplore: If Your Credit Score Is Under 740, Make These 4 Moves NowWhat makes a penny worth more than its face value comes down to a few factors, including rarity, errors, the year it was manufactured and materials used. For instance, an all-copper penny is worth more than a regular penny, which is made of zinc coated with copper.What should consumers know about pennies, and what makes them unique enough to be worth far more than a single cent? Here’s a look at six of the most expensive pennies out there and how much they go for, according to Gainesville Coins, along with a detailed description of what they look like should one be so lucky as to find one in their jar of spare change or beneath their couch covers.The 1931-S Lincoln CentSome 866,000 examples of the 1931-S Lincoln Cent were minted during the height of the Great Depression, and they’re worth $65 to $100+ a pop. These pennies are a deep copper color with a bold orange hue shining through. They tout a profile of Abraham Lincoln on the head side and two leaves on the tail side that wrap around the words “One Cent” in all caps. Aside from the year, 1931, this penny doesn’t look all that different from newer coins.The 1909-S Indian CentWorth between $300 and $1,000+, the 1909-S Indian cent is a brassy dull color bordering on smoky silver chrome. It features the profile of a head in a headdress on one side. On the flip side there’s a garland-decked wreath wrapping around the words “One Cent” in all caps, beneath a crest.Story continuesThe 1909-S VDB Lincoln CentThe 1909-S VDB Lincoln Cent goes for $600 to $1,300+ and is famous among coin collectors who will instantly recognize the “VDB” lettering on the coin, which refers to the coin designer Victor David Brenner. His initials were removed the following year due to a storm of controversy. These coins, of which only 484,000 were made, look like standard Lincoln wheat pennies of their time, save for those sly and oh so small “VDB” initials.The 1955 Doubled Die Lincoln CentMany coin collectors out there deem the 1955 doubled-die Lincoln cent, worth between $1,000 and $2,000+, the “Holy Grail” error coin. The error is plain to notice even for the untrained eye, so long as one looks closely. The print looks doubled or blurred on the head side.The 1944 Steel Lincoln CentNow we’re getting into some very serious money. The 1944 steel Lincoln cent goes for between $75,000 and upwards of $125,000. These pennies are easy to spot because they are made of steel and have a strong silvery hue. The 1944 and 1943 steel pennies are about equal in terms of rarity.Take Our Poll: Do You Think People Should Invest In Crypto?How To Make Money Fast: 24 Proven WaysThe 1943 Bronze Lincoln CentBe on the lookout for the1943 bronze Lincoln cent. It’s worth more than $125,000. This coin is special because no one knows exactly how many exist, although they likely number around 24. These bronze pennies are tricky to spot because at first they look just like an old rusty penny from the 1940s — nothing too rare. But look closely and you’ll notice the yellowish-brown sparkle and bluish luminescence that distinguish bronze from copper.More From GOBankingRates6 Shakeups to Social Security Expected in the New YearGet Top Holiday Shopping and Savings TipsThe 10 Best Rewards Credit Cards for 20237 Ways To Know You're Ready To Start InvestingThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Keep a Penny Jar?

132,805a5e08-a0f6-348b-afe5-150638d28b08,M,2022-12-01,"In Peru's hills, an artisanal miner boom frustrates Big Copper's plans",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/perus-hills-artisanal-miner-boom-111140165.html,1669893100,STORY,['M'],"[By Marco Aquino and Marcelo RochabrunTAPAIRIHUA, Peru (Reuters) - In the hills of Tapairihua in Peru's Andes, Samuel Retamozo and other artisanal miners have found a rich seam of copper on their indigenous community's land. Armed with temporary government permits, they started exploiting it earlier this year.There's just one problem - the seam is within the site of Southern Copper Corp's planned $2.6 billion Los Chancas mine. One of the world's biggest copper miners, it also has a permit to dig in the same area.Grupo Mexico's Southern Copper aims to start producing here in 2027 after decades of studies. The planned mine is crucial to the company's goal of producing 1.8 million tonnes of copper annually by 2030.But the rise of artisanal copper mining - driven by high global metal prices and sustained by a messy government permitting system - is threatening billions in new investments by Southern Copper and others in Peru, according to Reuters reviews of internal company reports, interviews with executives and a visit to Tapairihua to meet the miners.Small-scale copper miners are now challenging Big Copper for territorial control of rich deposits of the red metal. Artisanal copper mining is creating much-needed income for impoverished Andean Peruvians even as it brings them into conflict with major miners, a rare and previously unreported trend in the world's No. 2 copper producer.""This used to happen with silver and gold, but now it's affecting copper,"" said Raul Jacob, Southern Copper's chief financial officer, bemoaning what the company sees as the government's poor handling of artisanal mining permits.In Peru, artisanal mining permits have doubled to 80,000 since 2020, government records show. And copper is the new focus.Southern Copper is not the only mining company in a stand-off with the miners. Chinese-owned MMG Ltd's nearby Las Bambas copper mine is struggling to develop two new open pits because of artisanal miners who have settled on the same land. The company says its current pit is running out.Story continues""Informal mining is entering lands granted to formal (mining) companies and threatening the development of large-scale projects,"" a source close to MMG told Reuters.While companies often call small-scale miners ""informal"" or ""illegal,"" what complicates the matter are two dueling authorizations - one for artisanal mining and another to hold the mining rights to a given area. Mining companies own the latter, known as concessions.But since 2012 Peru has been granting artisanal mining permits on lands that overlap with concessions, giving the small-scale miners some legal protection, Reuters found after checking the geolocations of the permits and reviewing an internal document in which Peru's mining ministry did the same.POTENTIAL FOR MORE DISPUTESDisputes between mining firms and artisanal miners may only increase over time. Peru's leftist administration presented a new framework for artisanal mining last week that declared artisanal mining is ""as important"" as big mining.Southern Copper has asked the government to revoke all artisanal mining permits on its concession.

Armed with temporary government permits, they started exploiting it earlier this year.There's just one problem - the seam is within the site of Southern Copper Corp's planned $2.6 billion Los Chancas mine. One of the world's biggest copper miners, it also has a permit to dig in the same area.Grupo Mexico's Southern Copper aims to start producing here in 2027 after decades of studies. The planned mine is crucial to the company's goal of producing 1.8 million tonnes of copper annually by 2030.But the rise of artisanal copper mining - driven by high global metal prices and sustained by a messy government permitting system - is threatening billions in new investments by Southern Copper and others in Peru, according to Reuters reviews of internal company reports, interviews with executives and a visit to Tapairihua to meet the miners.Small-scale copper miners are now challenging Big Copper for territorial control of rich deposits of the red metal. Artisanal copper mining is creating much-needed income for impoverished Andean Peruvians even as it brings them into conflict with major miners, a rare and previously unreported trend in the world's No. 2 copper producer.""This used to happen with silver and gold, but now it's affecting copper,"" said Raul Jacob, Southern Copper's chief financial officer, bemoaning what the company sees as the government's poor handling of artisanal mining permits.In Peru, artisanal mining permits have doubled to 80,000 since 2020, government records show. And copper is the new focus.Southern Copper is not the only mining company in a stand-off with the miners. Chinese-owned MMG Ltd's nearby Las Bambas copper mine is struggling to develop two new open pits because of artisanal miners who have settled on the same land. The company says its current pit is running out.Story continues""Informal mining is entering lands granted to formal (mining) companies and threatening the development of large-scale projects,"" a source close to MMG told Reuters.While companies often call small-scale miners ""informal"" or ""illegal,"" what complicates the matter are two dueling authorizations - one for artisanal mining and another to hold the mining rights to a given area. Mining companies own the latter, known as concessions.But since 2012 Peru has been granting artisanal mining permits on lands that overlap with concessions, giving the small-scale miners some legal protection, Reuters found after checking the geolocations of the permits and reviewing an internal document in which Peru's mining ministry did the same.POTENTIAL FOR MORE DISPUTESDisputes between mining firms and artisanal miners may only increase over time. Peru's leftist administration presented a new framework for artisanal mining last week that declared artisanal mining is ""as important"" as big mining.Southern Copper has asked the government to revoke all artisanal mining permits on its concession. About half have now been canceled, causing resentment in Tapairihua.""We are going to defend ourselves.

""Volkswagen and other automakers have to include cobalt in their hedging programmes.""Volkswagen makes electric vehicles which use batteries containing cobalt. The German automaker told Reuters it does not use the CME's cobalt futures, but it trades bilaterally with banks using cash-settled OTC contracts.Banks then hedge their exposure to Volkswagen using CME cobalt, a second source familiar with the matter said.Volumes on the CME's cash-settled cobalt contract, launched in December 2020, have climbed 273% to 11,003 tonnes in the 10 months to end-October from the same period last year.Story continuesOpen interest, the number of outstanding contracts held by the market, for CME cobalt at 8,258 tonnes in October has jumped 352% from the same period last year. Open interest is spread across maturities from November 2022 to December 2025.CME Group declined to comment.The LME's cash-settled cobalt contract has not traded since its launch in 2019, while interest in its physically-deliverable contract has faded, evidenced by a 68% drop in volumes to 238 tonnes in Jan-Oct from the same period last year.Open interest on the LME's physically deliverable contract has been stuck at 13 tonnes since August compared with levels near 800 tonnes in December 2018.""CME brokers want to make the contract work. LME brokers don't care, it's not a core offering for them,"" the second source familiar with the matter said.LME declined to comment.According to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI), cobalt demand from the battery sector accounted for 47% of the total at 88,147 tonnes in 2015.BMI expects cobalt demand for batteries to rise to 68% at nearly 164,000 tonnes this year and 82% at 360,231 tonnes by 2030.Most of that growth will come from electric vehicles batteries, according to BMI analyst Caspar Rawles. Cobalt ensures batteries do not easily overheat or catch fire and it helps extend their life, which automakers typically guarantee for eight to 10 years.Glencore produced 31,300 tonnes of cobalt last year, much of it in the Democratic Republic of Congo where it is a byproduct of copper. Cobalt is also a byproduct of nickel production. (Reporting by Pratima Desai; Editing by Veronica Brown and Arun Koyyur)]"

Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds‘God have mercy on us all’: Robert Kiyosaki warned that the economy is the ‘biggest bubble’ in history and urged investors to dump paper assets — here are 3 real assets he likes instead“I believe economy is the biggest bubble in world history,” he said in a tweet. “God have mercy on us all.”Since a lot of financial assets have gotten cheaper in this market downturn, it might be tempting to buy the dip. But that’s not what Kiyosaki is doing.“Many of you know I do not invest in equities, bonds, ETS or MFs. Please DO NOT listen to what I’m going to say next: ‘I would get out of paper assets’,” he says, adding that the world economy “is not a ‘market.’”Instead, Kiyosaki likes three real assets for protection. Here’s a look at each one of them.Gold and silverPrecious metals — particularly gold and silver — have been a popular hedge against inflation and uncertainty. They can’t be printed out of thin air like fiat money and their value is largely unaffected by economic events around the world.Kiyosaki has long been a fan of gold — he first purchased the yellow metal in 1972.“I’m not buying gold because I like gold, I’m buying gold because I don’t trust the Fed,” he said in an interview last year.Kiyosaki likes silver, too. In fact, he tweeted “Silver best investment in Oct 2022” and “Everyone can afford $20 silver.”To be sure, precious metals weren’t immune to the sell-off that was happening in 2022. That being said, both metals are showing promise so far in 2023 with gold and silver both up around 5% over the past three months.Story continuesWhile there are many ways to gain exposure to gold and silver, Kiyosaki prefers to just buy the metal directly. Earlier in 2022, he tweeted that he only wants “real gold or silver coins” and not ETFs.The author also called silver “a bargain” recently. So it might be time to visit your local bullion shop.BitcoinBitcoin investors have learned the hard way just how volatile it can be.In November 2021, bitcoin reached a high of $68,990. As of Thursday, it was hovering around $32,015.17.But Kiyosaki doesn’t seem bothered by the cryptocurrency’s downturn.“BITCOIN? WORRIED? No,” he writes in a November tweet. “I am a Bitcoin investor as I am an investor in physical gold, silver, &amp; real estate.”In fact, he sees the crypto mayhem as an opportunity.“When BITCOIN hits new bottom, $10 to $12 k? I will get EXCITED, not worried.”Kiyosaki believes in bitcoin for the same reason he loves precious metals: a distrust in our fiat money system and the government.“I bet against the Fed, Treasury, Biden, &amp; bet on [gold], [silver], &amp; Bitcoin,” he explained.In December 2022, he tweeted another reason for his continued interest in the crypto coin.""Bitcoin is classified as a commodity much like gold, silver, and oil. Most crypto tokens are classifed as a security and SEC regulations will crush most of them. I am buying more BC""These days, it’s very easy to tap into bitcoin: you can buy bitcoin directly.

The dollar index dropped nearly 1%. The greenback has rallied sharply this year partially due to it safe haven status amid Russia-Ukraine conflict and prospects of aggressive monetary policy tightening by the U.S. central bank. Powell said the Fed has been ""pretty aggressive"" already with its rate hikes and won't try to crash the economy with further sharp increases just to get price rises under control faster.

The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, read around 5% in October, well above the Fed’s 2% target.But Powell’s comments still sparked a broad-based rally in metal markets, as the prospect of slower rate hikes offered some near-term relief to markets battered by rising interest rates this year.Spot gold rose 0.5% to $1,778.20 an ounce, while gold futures expiring in February rallied 1.8% to $1,791.25 an ounce, their highest level since mid-August. Both instruments surged over 1% on Wednesday.Gold prices also logged strong gains in November as several Fed officials flagged smaller rate hikes in the coming months.Still, the outlook for the yellow metal is clouded by uncertainty over where U.S. interest rates will peak, given that the Fed’s terminal rate will be largely determined by the path of U.S. inflation.Among industrial metals, copper prices surged to an over two-week high on positive signals on a potential reopening in China.Copper futures were steady around $3.7838 a pound on Thursday, after rallying over 4% in the prior session- their best day in nearly a month.China scaled back COVID-related restrictions in two major cities this week amid growing public opposition to the country’s strict zero-COVID policy, which saw unprecedented protests rock several parts of the country.Story continuesChina’s zero-COVID policy caused widespread economic disruption in the country this year, denting business activities and also weighing on its appetite for commodities.But a potential reopening in the world’s largest copper importer is largely expected to trigger a recovery in demand, benefiting copper prices.Related ArticlesGold hits over 3-month high as Powell flags slower rate hikesOil edges higher on tight supply, China demand recovery optimismBiden nominee to be ambassador to Russia pledges to prioritize prisoner release]"

140,311c6e71-5990-3f02-835f-2d835f4ead89,WYNN,2022-12-01,"Following a 0.9% decline over last year, recent gains may please Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/following-0-9-decline-over-163303842.html,1669825983,STORY,['WYNN'],"[A look at the shareholders of Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 66% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 6.2% increase in share prices after a year of 0.9% losses as a sign that returns are likely to begin trending higher.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Wynn Resorts. View our latest analysis for Wynn Resorts ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wynn Resorts?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Wynn Resorts. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Wynn Resorts' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Wynn Resorts is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 10% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 8.1% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 8 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Wynn ResortsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Wynn Resorts, Limited. Insiders own US$1.4b worth of shares in the US$9.0b company. That's quite meaningful. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 18% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Wynn Resorts better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Wynn Resorts  that you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

If you want to read about some more healthcare stocks, go directly to Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Healthcare Stocks to Consider.The healthcare sector is being forced to deal with new challenges related to valuation and access to capital as the COVID-19 pandemic recedes. Even as the priorities in the sector change, the healthcare industry remains one of the key drivers of growth for the United States economy with giants like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) contributing to a stellar valuation that is expected to increase to $1.7 trillion in value by 2030. The healthcare industry is also one of the safest picks for a retirement stock portfolio. This is indicated by the historical performance of the sector during times of crisis. A recent Endpoint survey reveals that 66% of investors think that biotech will outperform the broader market in 2022. When viewed in context of rising rates and soaring inflation, two factors that have pummeled the market and slowed growth in recent months, these sentiments highlight the reputation of the health industry among elite investors. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the healthcare sector and have established business models that have demonstrated historical resilience against inflationary headwinds were selected for the list. We preferred companies that either pay strong dividends or are working on projects with long-term growth prospects. These stocks are also popular among the 920 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of the third quarter. Retirement Stock Portfolio: Safe Healthcare Stocks to Consider11. Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26 Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) researches, develops, manufactures, and markets healthcare products worldwide. It is one of the best healthcare stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 24, Novartis revealed that its iptacopan, an oral drug, met the two main goal of a phase three trial by showing superiority over AstraZeneca’s Soliris and Ultomiris to treat adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Story continuesOn September 7, Morgan Stanley analyst Mark Purcell maintained an Equal Weight rating on Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) stock and lowered the price target to CHF 88 from CHF 97.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Renaissance Technologies is a leading shareholder in Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) with 3.2 million shares worth more than $241.8 million.Just like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) is one of the best healthcare stocks to consider for a retirement stock portfolio. 10. Teladoc Health, Inc. (NYSE:TDOC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27    Teladoc Health, Inc. (NYSE:TDOC) provides virtual healthcare services in the United States and internationally. It is one of the top healthcare stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On August 26, Cloud X announced that it is collaborating with Teladoc Health to better serve the remote monitoring needs of patients in Canada. In this partnership, existing RPM services of the Cloud DX will be enhanced with Teladoc’s virtual care capabilities.On October 27, Citi analyst Daniel Grosslight maintained a Neutral rating on Teladoc Health, Inc. (NYSE:TDOC) stock and lowered the price target to $36 from $38, noting that the company delivered a solid third quarter and a clear path forward was beginning. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 27 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $906.3 million in Teladoc Health, Inc. (NYSE:TDOC), compared to 32 the preceding quarter worth $1.2 billion.In its Q1 2022 investor letter, RiverPark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Teladoc Health, Inc. (NYSE:TDOC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Teladoc Health, Inc. (NYSE:TDOC) is the largest telehealth provider in the US and has recently begun to expand internationally. TDOC’s platform enables an ever-expanding list of patient-doctor interactions (including those for primary health care, mental health issues and chronic condition management) to transition from an on-site visit to one that can be done remotely with full video- based interaction. TDOC provides its platform of services on both a business-to-business and direct-to-consumer basis, through monthly subscription-based relationships. For its core business-to-business clients, the company contracts with a wide range of entities, including large scale employers (the company currently contracts with over 50% of the Fortune 500), health plans, health systems, and medical insurance companies, which currently cover more than 50 million members. For these customers, the company provides a win-win-win, as patients spend no time traveling and less time waiting, doctors are more efficient seeing more patients in less time, and payers (employers and plan sponsors) save money while being able to offer a highly popular additional benefit for their employees. This B2B market is projected to be a +$100 billion market opportunity and TDOC is the clear global market leader. For its direct-to- consumer clients, the company provides a growing suite of services for individuals to have affordable access to on-demand and scheduled medical services, for which their current insurance does not provide reimbursement (such as extended mental health counseling) (…read more)9. Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45    Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO) manufactures, and distributes life science research and clinical diagnostic products in the United States, Europe, Asia, Canada, and Latin America.

This deal will be worth more than $10 billion.On August 24, Credit Suisse analyst Dan Leonard initiated coverage of Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

(NYSE:BIO), compared to 43 in the previous quarter worth $1.3 billion.8. Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62    Zoetis, Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) discovers, develops, manufactures, and commercializes animal health medicines, vaccines, and diagnostic products in the United States and internationally. It is one of the major healthcare stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On September 5, Zoetis declared that it has acquired NewMetrica, a Scottish health related digital tools developer. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Zoetis expects that NewMetrica’s tools will support the earlier detection and treatment of diseases as they gain more sight of the quality of life of pets. On October 17, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott maintained an Overweight rating on Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) stock and lowered the price target to $225 from $250, noting that vet visit pressures remain but appear increasingly well reflected in the valuations of animal health names.  Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Cantillon Capital Management is a leading shareholder in Zoetis, Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) with 1.9 million shares worth more than $275.5 million. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Zoetis, Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Shares of Zoetis, Inc. (NYSE:ZTS), the global leader in the discovery, development, and manufacturing of companion and farm animal health medicine and vaccines, fell along with shares of other high-multiple 2021 standout performers. We retain conviction as Zoetis recently reported a top and bottom line beat with more than 21% growth driven by dermatology, parasiticides, and recently launched monoclonal osteoarthritic treatments. The company’s 2022 guidance was in line with Street expectations, calling for 9% to 11% operational revenue growth and modest margin expansion despite heavy investment in core growth drivers.”7. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64    HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) provides health care services in the United States. It is one of the elite healthcare stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On October 21, HCA Healthcare posted earnings for the third quarter of 2022, reporting earnings per share of $3.93, beating market estimates by $0.07. The revenue over the period was $14.97 billion, down 2.0% compared to the revenue over the same period last year and missing market estimates by $30 million. On October 26, investment advisory Citi maintained a Buy rating on HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) stock and raised the price target to $251 from $240. Analyst Jason Cassorla issued the ratings update. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 64 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.5 billion in HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), compared to 63 the preceding quarter worth $2.2 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Diamond Hill Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) is a best-in-class operator of acute care hospitals and other health care facilities, including outpatient surgery centers. It has a strong market presence in highly attractive geographies with growing populations and low unemployment, such as Texas and Florida, which leads to a favorable payor mix. We are further attracted to its strong management team that has a stellar track record of deploying capital, and the founding family continues to own almost a quarter of the business. We initiated a position after HCA reported Q1 earnings — it reduced full year guidance due to increased labor costs and lower-than-expected acuity among COVID admissions, dampening near-term investor sentiment.”6. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67  CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) provides health services in the United States. It is one of the prominent healthcare stocks for a retirement stock portfolio. On November 2, CVS Health Corp declared that its adjusted profit will be in the range of $8.70 to $8.90 per share in 2023. This is higher than the new adjusted earnings forecast of $8.55 to $8.65 per share for this year.On November 6, Raymond James analyst John Ransom maintained an Outperform rating on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) stock and lowered the price target to $115 from $120, noting that the company's third quarter results exceeded expectations.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Connecticut-based investment firm AQR Capital Management is a leading shareholder in CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) with 3.8 million shares worth more than $365.7 million.Along with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is one of the best healthcare stocks to consider for a retirement stock portfolio. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Vltava Fund, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.” Click to continue reading and see Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Healthcare Stocks to Consider. Suggested Articles:10 Best Biotech Stocks To BuyObama Stock Portfolio: 10-Year Returns11 Best Covid Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Procter &amp; Gamble Company PG, The Coca-Cola Company KO, The Progressive PGR, Zoetis ZTS and Palo Alto Networks PANW.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Top Stock Reports for Procter &amp; Gamble, Coca-Cola and ProgressiveThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, The Coca-Cola Company and The Progressive. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Procter &amp; Gamble have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (-1.6% vs. -3.1%) as well as the S&amp;P 500 index (-1.6% vs. -16.4%). This performance momentum has been underpinned by a history of outperformance, with the recent strong Q3 report the 10th straight quarter of better-than-expected top and bottom line results. Sales improved year over year driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments.Improved productivity amid cost headwinds has also aided the results. It witnessed SG&amp;A expense leverage, owing to savings from overhead and marketing expenses, and cost leverage gains due to higher sales and real estate.However, commodity cost inflation, increase in freight costs, product and packaging investments and other impacts hurt margins. Also, it issued a drab fiscal 2023 view due to inflation, higher freight and currency woes.(You can read the full research report on Procter &amp; Gamble here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Coca-Cola shares have gained +14.9% over the past year, modestly outperforming Pepsi at +12% and doing significantly better than the S&amp;P 500 index at -16.4%. Its top and bottom lines surpassed estimates for the seventh straight quarter in Q3. The company's results benefited from the continued momentum from the first half of 2022. Sales gained from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and an increase in concentrate sales.Coca-Cola benefited from underlying share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels. It raised the organic revenues and comparable earnings per share growth guidance for 2022. It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments.However, pressures from higher supply chain costs, including transportation and input costs remain. Higher marketing spends and currency headwinds are also concerning.(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Progressive have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past year (+39.9% vs. +13.9%). The company continues to gain on higher premiums, given its compelling product portfolio, leadership position and strength in both Vehicle and Property businesses.Focus on becoming a one-stop insurance destination, catering to customers opting for a combination of home and auto insurance, augurs well for the company's growth. Policies in force and retention ratio should remain healthy. Competitive pricing to retain current customers and address customer needs with new offerings should continue to drive policy life expectancy.However, exposure to catastrophe losses induces underwriting volatility. Escalating expenses due to higher losses and settlement expenses remain an overhang on the company's margin. High debt level along with low times earned interest pose financial risk.(You can read the full research report on Progressive here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Zoetis and Palo Alto Networks.Story continuesWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

(NEE) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nextera-energy-inc-nee-trending-140002963.html,1669816802,STORY,"['NEE', 'NEE-PR']","[NextEra Energy (NEE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this parent company of Florida Power &amp; Light Co. Have returned +6.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, which NextEra falls in, has gained 3.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, NextEra is expected to post earnings of $0.54 per share, indicating a change of +31.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.7% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.90 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +13.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.14 indicates a change of +8.3% from what NextEra is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for NextEra.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NEE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For NextEra, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.76 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $20.4 billion and $26.65 billion estimates indicate +19.5% and +30.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNextEra reported revenues of $6.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +53.8%. EPS of $0.85 for the same period compares with $0.75 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.35 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.77%. The EPS surprise was +7.59%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.NextEra is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about NextEra. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Nasdaq: PDCO) today reported consolidated net sales of $1.63 billion (see attached Sales Summary for further details) in its fiscal second quarter ended October 29, 2022, a decrease of 1.4 percent compared to the same period last year. Internal sales, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation, increased 0.7 percent over the prior year period.Reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was $54.1 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to $48.3 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.

The year-over-year increase in reported and adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 is primarily due to operating margin expansion in both business segments.""Our second quarter results reflect the strength of our strategy and talented team,"" said Don Zurbay, President and CEO of Patterson Companies. ""Despite ongoing challenges in the macroeconomic environment, Patterson delivered internal sales growth, operating margin expansion in both of our segments and improved adjusted earnings performance. We also continued to execute our balanced capital allocation strategy by investing in our business, returning cash to shareholders and announcing two strategic transactions that deepen our value proposition.Story continues""Patterson is well-positioned to achieve our goals and drive long-term shareholder value through the continued execution of our proven strategy. We remain committed to delivering on our fiscal 2023 EPS guidance.""Patterson DentalReported net sales in the Dental segment for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 were $628.9 million. Internal sales increased 1.6 percent compared to the fiscal 2022 second quarter. Internal sales of consumables declined 4.9 percent year-over-year primarily due to the continued moderation of infection control products compared to the pandemic-related performance in the year-ago period. Excluding infection control products, internal sales of consumables increased 1.0 percent year-over-year. Compared to the prior year period, internal sales of equipment increased 11.1 percent and internal sales of value-added services increased 7.8 percent.Patterson Animal HealthReported net sales in the Animal Health segment for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 were $1.0 billion.

Within the Animal Health segment, internal sales of consumables grew 0.6 percent, equipment and software decreased 1.6 percent and value-added services increased 19.5 percent compared to the prior year period.Balance Sheet and Capital AllocationDuring the first six months of fiscal 2023, Patterson Companies used $520.2 million of cash from operating activities and collected deferred purchase price receivables of $489.6 million, using $30.5 million in cash, compared to generating $46.6 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow1 (see definition below and attached free cash flow table) during the first six months of fiscal 2023 declined by $88.4 million compared to the first six months of fiscal 2022 due to an increased level of working capital during the first six months of fiscal 2023.In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Patterson Companies declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share and returned $25.3 million in cash dividends to shareholders. Through the first six months of fiscal 2023, Patterson Companies has returned $65.7 million to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases.Year-to-Date ResultsConsolidated reported net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2023 totaled $3.1 billion, a 3.5 percent year-over-year decrease. Sales in the first six months of fiscal 2022 reflected an extra week of sales results in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Internal sales for the first six months of fiscal 2023, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation and the extra week of selling results in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, increased 1.9 percent year-over-year.

Adjusted net income1 attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc., which excludes deal amortization, integration and business restructuring expenses, legal reserves, inventory donation charges and gains on investments totaled $92.9 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, compared to $99.2 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, in the year-ago period.Fiscal 2023 GuidancePatterson Companies today reaffirmed its fiscal 2023 earnings guidance, which is provided on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted1 basis:GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.96 to $2.06 per diluted share.Non-GAAP adjusted earnings1 are expected to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 per diluted share.Our non-GAAP adjusted earnings1 guidance excludes the after-tax impact of:Deal amortization expenses of approximately $28.5 million ($0.29 per diluted share).Our guidance reflects the strength of our business and competitive positioning, as well as our expectations for the North American and international end markets in which we operate, which we expect to be affected by the ongoing challenges of inflationary trends and higher interest rates as well as a potential slow-down in the broader economy. Beyond macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, our guidance further assumes that there are no material adverse developments associated with the pandemic.1Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Measures table appearing behind the accompanying financial information is provided to adjust reported GAAP measures, namely operating income, other income (expense), net income before taxes, income tax expense, net income, net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. and diluted earnings per share attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc., for the impact of deal amortization, integration and business restructuring expenses, legal reserves, inventory donation charges and gains on investments along with the related tax effects of these items.The term ""free cash flow"" used in this release is defined as net cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures plus the collection of deferred purchase price receivables.In addition, the term ""internal sales"" used in this release represents net sales adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign currency and the extra week of selling results in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Foreign currency impact represents the difference in results that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates the company uses to convert results for all foreign entities where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. The company calculates the impact as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period's currency exchange rates. The company believes the disclosure of net sales changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of fluctuations in currency rates.Management believes that these non-GAAP measures may provide a helpful representation of the company's second quarter performance and enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding, similarly captioned, GAAP measures.Second Quarter Conference Call and ReplayPatterson Companies’ fiscal 2023 second quarter conference call will start at 8:30 a.m. Eastern today.

These new price assessments complement previously launched 'blue ammonia' assessments to further enhance transparency in global hydrogen markets.S&amp;P Global Inc. logoMario Perez, Managing Editor, Global Hydrogen at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights said, ""This latest addition to the Platts low carbon ammonia price assessment offering will provide valuable insight into trade flows of low carbon ammonia produced from renewable power. What's more, by focusing on renewable power production pathways, market participants can now look to this latest suite of Platts assessments to begin to differentiate ammonia based on its carbon intensity when compared to both the existing ammonia market and the 'blue ammonia' option. S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights expects low-carbon ammonia, which is derived from hydrogen produced by electrolysis of water using renewable power, to displace 57% of the global conventional ammonia market by 2050. In addition to conventional markets switching to low carbon ammonia, there are projects being developed to use low carbon ammonia as a shipping fuel and in power generation. Ammonia is also seen as one of the key transport vectors for transporting large amounts of low carbon hydrogen to import centers around the world.These new assessments will reflect values into the prime low carbon ammonia import regions of Northwest Europe and Far East Asia. The new assessments will be in $ per metric ton and $ per MMBtu for the locations below:Renewable Power derived ammonia production delivered to Far East AsiaWest Coast Canada to Far EastMiddle East to Far EastAustralia to Far EastRenewable Power derived ammonia production delivered to Northwest EuropeUS Gulf Coast to Northwest EuropeMiddle East to Northwest EuropeEast Coast Canada to Northwest EuropeThe prices will be published in the recently launched Platts Hydrogen Daily report, complementing the 'blue ammonia' prices which represent ammonia production with 90% of its CO2 emissions captured and sequestrated. Platts Hydrogen Daily is the first daily global hydrogen price, news and insights report from an independent price reporting agency. It includes the latest analyses of market fundamentals, trends and factors driving global hydrogen markets, as well as prices from associated low carbon ammonia markets.Story continuesMedia Contacts:Global/EMEA: Paul Sandell, +44 7816 180039, paul.sandell@spglobal.comAmericas: Kathleen Tanzy, + 1917 331 4607, kathleen.tanzy@spglobal.comAsia: Melissa Tan, + 65 68189 7569, melissa.tan@spglobal.comAbout S&amp;P Global Commodity InsightsAt S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, our complete view of global energy and commodity markets enables our customers to make decisions with conviction and create long-term, sustainable value.We are a trusted connector that brings together thought leaders, market participants, governments, and regulators and we create solutions that lead to progress.

(NASDAQ:INTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is a California-based business software company that mainly deals in financial software. In fiscal Q1 2023, the company posted revenue of $2.6 billion, which showed a 29.4% growth from the prior-year period.

(NASDAQ:INTU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We took advantage of its 2022 price decline to add a small position in Intuit. INTU is a leading SaaS software solutions provider to small businesses, consumers, and professional accountants, best known for its QuickBooks accounting and TurboTax tax preparation platforms. INTU recently strengthened its personal finance offerings with the acquisitions of Mint and Credit Karma, and its small business offering with the acquisition of email marketing platform Mailchimp. The company is benefitting from the secular shift to digitization for both businesses and consumers. Given its vast amount of valuable personal finance and tax customer data from its 100 million + customer installed base, the company can apply artificial intelligence to the data to generate actionable intelligence for customers, as well as a large cross-selling opportunity across its products.Given INTU’s less than 5% penetration of its $300 billion market, we believe the company can grow its top-line mid-teens, while improving its high-margin business model of greater than 80% gross margins and greater than 35% EBITDA margin, leading to high-teens EPS growth for the foreseeable future. At about 2% of revenue, the company also requires limited capital expenditures, producing significant and growing FCF, which INTU has used for acquisitions, a small dividend, debt repayment and stock buybacks.”12.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Spin-offs have been a valuable source of uncorrelated return for the portfolio since inception, whether investing in them directly or retaining ownership stakes in the spun-off assets of existing holdings. During the quarter Danaher announced the spin of its Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions group (EAS) expected to close in late 2023. Danaher have been masters of the spin over the last decade and once again this one appears to make sense for both parties. The parent becomes a pure-play life sciences and diagnostics business with higher growth, margins and returns plus more M&amp;A firepower. EAS, with leading positions in water quality through assets like Hach, ChemTreat and Trojan will, as a standalone business, have a more focused M&amp;A strategy and represent an attractive water-related exposure for ESG focused funds. The spinco will still operate with the highly regarded Danaher Business System though (like ‘Fortive Business System’) we expect this to get rebranded while still delivering outstanding financial results.”10. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89The Home Depot, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) shares were more resilient in Q3 as the company continues to perform well and reiterated guidance despite increasing market concerns regarding general inflationary pressures and the impact rising mortgage rates may have on the housing market. We view the longterm prospects and multi-year fundamental outlook as unchanged. Home improvement through repair and remodel is likely to be one of more resilient housing-related industries given the relative attractiveness for consumers to renovate existing homes rather than reset their current low fixed mortgage rate to higher rates that we’re seeing today.”9.

Among these hedge funds, TCI Fund Management was the company's largest stakeholder in Q3.Baron Funds mentioned S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Shares of rating agency and data provider S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) fell 9% during the third quarter due to continued weak debt issuance activity and headwinds to the Indices business from equity market declines. Credit markets were exceptionally soft during the quarter with non-financial corporate bond issuance down 36% for investment grade and down 84% for high yield, reflecting greater investor risk aversion, rising interest rates, and a drop-off in M&amp;A activity. We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year. Over the long term, the company should continue benefiting from the secular trends of increasing bond issuance, growth in passive investing, and demand for data and analytics, while enjoying meaningful and durable competitive advantages that, in our view, are only strengthening following the merger with IHS Markit.”8. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is an American multinational financial services holding company. In November, Citigroup maintained a Neutral rating on the stock with a $40 price target, highlighting the company's efficient capital returns over the years.Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) holds a nine-year track record of consistent dividend growth, which places it as one of the best dividend stocks on our list.

Berkshire Hathaway was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.Here is what Artisan Partners said about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We made only one new purchase during the quarter, initiating a position in Bank of America (BAC). As one of America’s largest banks, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is second only to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in size and is probably its closest peer. Both are well-run banks, but compared to JPM, since the GFC, BAC has retired more shares, grown EPS faster and currently has more capital and a lower dividend payout. We are attracted to BAC’s strong capital base, high capital generation capacity, large loan loss reserve, low (~50%) loan/deposit ratio, short duration investment securities book, and low dividend payout that provides financial flexibility. BAC has a less volatile earnings stream than JPM with lower capital market sensitive exposures. Additionally, BAC is rigorously stress tested by the Fed every year in quantitative and qualitative fashion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which we hold in the portfolio, owns 12% of BAC. He petitioned the Fed to own more than 10%, so he clearly likes it. Bank stocks were strong gainers in 2021 on the prospects of higher rates boosting net interest margins, but the stocks pulled back in the first half of 2022 on economic concerns. We believe BAC has massive scale advantages, should benefit from increasing interest rates, particularly in the 2-year part of the yield curve, and should grow over time with the economy. The economic environment is highly uncertain, but current consensus includes the provision for losses more than doubling and capital markets activity slowing. Against that backdrop, our purchase price equated to about 8.5X our estimates of “mid-cycle” earnings. With leading businesses, a double-digit ROE, a prudent capital return strategy and a strong balance sheet, we believe this entry point offers a solid long-term value.”6. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is an American multinational investment bank and financial services holding company.

The cost of a whole chicken was $1.86 a pound, while boneless chicken breast went for $4.67 a pound. Ham was listed as going for $4.43 a pound.By comparison, a two-pound box of Beyond Meat Inc (NASDAQ:BYND) burger patties is selling for $14.80 on Walmart Inc's (NYSE:WMT) website, or $7.40 a pound, while a one-pound package of ground beef is selling for $4.58.A 10-ounce package of Beyond Meat chicken nuggets is selling for $4.98 on Walmart.com, (or around $7.91 a pound), while a two-pound bag of frozen Tyson Foods Inc (NYSE:TSN) chicken nuggets is selling for $6.98.A whole Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) dinner ham was quoted at $34.35, or $4.58 a pound, on Walmart’s website.Barclays cut its ratings on both Beyond Meat and Tyson this week, saying “the worst is yet to come” as consumers shift their purchasing habits in favor of less expensive proteins and other food.It cut Beyond Meat to underweight from equal weight and moved its price target to $10 from $13.

More like a penny for hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Indeed, parents may want to be extra careful next time they empty out their kids’ piggy banks. They might just be holding a fortune in the form of what appears to be a mere cent. This isn’t news among seasoned collectors. A quick search on eBay for collectible pennies turns up more than 1,900 results as of Wednesday, Nov. 30.See: Have Any $200 Quarters Lying Around? It’s Worth Checking Your Spare ChangeExplore: If Your Credit Score Is Under 740, Make These 4 Moves NowWhat makes a penny worth more than its face value comes down to a few factors, including rarity, errors, the year it was manufactured and materials used. For instance, an all-copper penny is worth more than a regular penny, which is made of zinc coated with copper.What should consumers know about pennies, and what makes them unique enough to be worth far more than a single cent? Here’s a look at six of the most expensive pennies out there and how much they go for, according to Gainesville Coins, along with a detailed description of what they look like should one be so lucky as to find one in their jar of spare change or beneath their couch covers.The 1931-S Lincoln CentSome 866,000 examples of the 1931-S Lincoln Cent were minted during the height of the Great Depression, and they’re worth $65 to $100+ a pop. These pennies are a deep copper color with a bold orange hue shining through. They tout a profile of Abraham Lincoln on the head side and two leaves on the tail side that wrap around the words “One Cent” in all caps. Aside from the year, 1931, this penny doesn’t look all that different from newer coins.The 1909-S Indian CentWorth between $300 and $1,000+, the 1909-S Indian cent is a brassy dull color bordering on smoky silver chrome. It features the profile of a head in a headdress on one side. On the flip side there’s a garland-decked wreath wrapping around the words “One Cent” in all caps, beneath a crest.Story continuesThe 1909-S VDB Lincoln CentThe 1909-S VDB Lincoln Cent goes for $600 to $1,300+ and is famous among coin collectors who will instantly recognize the “VDB” lettering on the coin, which refers to the coin designer Victor David Brenner. His initials were removed the following year due to a storm of controversy. These coins, of which only 484,000 were made, look like standard Lincoln wheat pennies of their time, save for those sly and oh so small “VDB” initials.The 1955 Doubled Die Lincoln CentMany coin collectors out there deem the 1955 doubled-die Lincoln cent, worth between $1,000 and $2,000+, the “Holy Grail” error coin. The error is plain to notice even for the untrained eye, so long as one looks closely. The print looks doubled or blurred on the head side.The 1944 Steel Lincoln CentNow we’re getting into some very serious money. The 1944 steel Lincoln cent goes for between $75,000 and upwards of $125,000. These pennies are easy to spot because they are made of steel and have a strong silvery hue. The 1944 and 1943 steel pennies are about equal in terms of rarity.Take Our Poll: Do You Think People Should Invest In Crypto?How To Make Money Fast: 24 Proven WaysThe 1943 Bronze Lincoln CentBe on the lookout for the1943 bronze Lincoln cent. It’s worth more than $125,000. This coin is special because no one knows exactly how many exist, although they likely number around 24. These bronze pennies are tricky to spot because at first they look just like an old rusty penny from the 1940s — nothing too rare. But look closely and you’ll notice the yellowish-brown sparkle and bluish luminescence that distinguish bronze from copper.More From GOBankingRates6 Shakeups to Social Security Expected in the New YearGet Top Holiday Shopping and Savings TipsThe 10 Best Rewards Credit Cards for 20237 Ways To Know You're Ready To Start InvestingThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Keep a Penny Jar?

Armed with temporary government permits, they started exploiting it earlier this year.There's just one problem - the seam is within the site of Southern Copper Corp's planned $2.6 billion Los Chancas mine.

""Volkswagen and other automakers have to include cobalt in their hedging programmes.""Volkswagen makes electric vehicles which use batteries containing cobalt. The German automaker told Reuters it does not use the CME's cobalt futures, but it trades bilaterally with banks using cash-settled OTC contracts.Banks then hedge their exposure to Volkswagen using CME cobalt, a second source familiar with the matter said.Volumes on the CME's cash-settled cobalt contract, launched in December 2020, have climbed 273% to 11,003 tonnes in the 10 months to end-October from the same period last year.Story continuesOpen interest, the number of outstanding contracts held by the market, for CME cobalt at 8,258 tonnes in October has jumped 352% from the same period last year. Open interest is spread across maturities from November 2022 to December 2025.CME Group declined to comment.The LME's cash-settled cobalt contract has not traded since its launch in 2019, while interest in its physically-deliverable contract has faded, evidenced by a 68% drop in volumes to 238 tonnes in Jan-Oct from the same period last year.Open interest on the LME's physically deliverable contract has been stuck at 13 tonnes since August compared with levels near 800 tonnes in December 2018.""CME brokers want to make the contract work. LME brokers don't care, it's not a core offering for them,"" the second source familiar with the matter said.LME declined to comment.According to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI), cobalt demand from the battery sector accounted for 47% of the total at 88,147 tonnes in 2015.BMI expects cobalt demand for batteries to rise to 68% at nearly 164,000 tonnes this year and 82% at 360,231 tonnes by 2030.Most of that growth will come from electric vehicles batteries, according to BMI analyst Caspar Rawles. Cobalt ensures batteries do not easily overheat or catch fire and it helps extend their life, which automakers typically guarantee for eight to 10 years.Glencore produced 31,300 tonnes of cobalt last year, much of it in the Democratic Republic of Congo where it is a byproduct of copper. Cobalt is also a byproduct of nickel production. (Reporting by Pratima Desai; Editing by Veronica Brown and Arun Koyyur)]"

Stocks, bonds, and even crypto plunged.But the worst could be yet to come according to Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki.Don't miss'Hold onto your money': Jeff Bezos issued a financial warning, says you might want to rethink buying a 'new automobile, refrigerator, or whatever' — here are 3 better recession-proof buysHere's how much the average American 60-year-old holds in retirement savings — how does your nest egg compare?Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds‘God have mercy on us all’: Robert Kiyosaki warned that the economy is the ‘biggest bubble’ in history and urged investors to dump paper assets — here are 3 real assets he likes instead“I believe economy is the biggest bubble in world history,” he said in a tweet. “God have mercy on us all.”Since a lot of financial assets have gotten cheaper in this market downturn, it might be tempting to buy the dip. But that’s not what Kiyosaki is doing.“Many of you know I do not invest in equities, bonds, ETS or MFs. Please DO NOT listen to what I’m going to say next: ‘I would get out of paper assets’,” he says, adding that the world economy “is not a ‘market.’”Instead, Kiyosaki likes three real assets for protection. Here’s a look at each one of them.Gold and silverPrecious metals — particularly gold and silver — have been a popular hedge against inflation and uncertainty. They can’t be printed out of thin air like fiat money and their value is largely unaffected by economic events around the world.Kiyosaki has long been a fan of gold — he first purchased the yellow metal in 1972.“I’m not buying gold because I like gold, I’m buying gold because I don’t trust the Fed,” he said in an interview last year.Kiyosaki likes silver, too. In fact, he tweeted “Silver best investment in Oct 2022” and “Everyone can afford $20 silver.”To be sure, precious metals weren’t immune to the sell-off that was happening in 2022. That being said, both metals are showing promise so far in 2023 with gold and silver both up around 5% over the past three months.Story continuesWhile there are many ways to gain exposure to gold and silver, Kiyosaki prefers to just buy the metal directly. Earlier in 2022, he tweeted that he only wants “real gold or silver coins” and not ETFs.The author also called silver “a bargain” recently. So it might be time to visit your local bullion shop.BitcoinBitcoin investors have learned the hard way just how volatile it can be.In November 2021, bitcoin reached a high of $68,990. As of Thursday, it was hovering around $32,015.17.But Kiyosaki doesn’t seem bothered by the cryptocurrency’s downturn.“BITCOIN? WORRIED? No,” he writes in a November tweet. “I am a Bitcoin investor as I am an investor in physical gold, silver, &amp; real estate.”In fact, he sees the crypto mayhem as an opportunity.“When BITCOIN hits new bottom, $10 to $12 k? I will get EXCITED, not worried.”Kiyosaki believes in bitcoin for the same reason he loves precious metals: a distrust in our fiat money system and the government.“I bet against the Fed, Treasury, Biden, &amp; bet on [gold], [silver], &amp; Bitcoin,” he explained.In December 2022, he tweeted another reason for his continued interest in the crypto coin.""Bitcoin is classified as a commodity much like gold, silver, and oil. Most crypto tokens are classifed as a security and SEC regulations will crush most of them. I am buying more BC""These days, it’s very easy to tap into bitcoin: you can buy bitcoin directly. Just be aware that many exchanges charge up to 4% in commission fees just to buy and sell crypto. So look for investing apps that charge low or even zero commissions.What to read nextYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Americans are paying nearly 40% more on home insurance compared to 12 years ago — here's how to spend less on peace of mindThe US dollar has lost 98% of its purchasing power since 1971 — protect your retirement nest egg with this stable alternativeThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

The e-commerce giant had previously put a hold on ""new incremental hires in [its] corporate workforce,"" the company said in a statement on Nov. 3. In October, the e-commerce giant put a hold on hiring in for its retail business.Story continuesAmazon experienced explosive growth during the pandemic as shoppers flocked to the online retailer for everything from toilet paper to video games.

This is the second time in less than a year that Lyft has passed out pink slips. In July, the firm laid off 60 employees from its rental division. According to Lyft, the latest move will cost the company $27 million to $32 million in restructuring and charges for employee severance and benefits.MetaMeta (META) laid off 11,000 workers in November, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that he'd grossly miscalculated the macroeconomic climate.Meta's stock has been in free fall for months, as a drop in advertiser spending and Apple's iOS privacy changes bite into the company's revenue.

Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon announced the freeze during the company’s Q4 earnings report, during which the company revealed lower-than-expected guidance for Q1.While Amon didn’t mention job cuts, he did say that the chip designer is prepared to further reduce operating expenses if need be.SnapSnap (SNAP) cut roughly 20% of its workforce in August as it continues to struggle with slowing ad sales. The company saw revenue growth of just 6% in Q3, its slowest ever. Still, daily active users increased by 19%, to 363 million.Advertisers are pulling back on ad sales as interest rates, inflation, and currency fluctuations hit corporate budgets.

As a result, diversification when done correctly can help reduce sector and company specific risk.Diversification does not reduce systemic risk and there will always be risks that diversification will not be able to remove. If the market crashes, many stocks in many different sectors will decline.Generally, however, many investors believe in the power of diversification. Many quantitative hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies own holdings in thousands of different stocks.In terms of diversification, there are many different types including diversification through asset class. A classic example is where an investor invests 60% in leading equities and 40% in leading bonds. Another example of diversification is by diversifying through industry sector. By owning leading shares in all the sectors, a bad performance in one sector might not affect a portfolio all that much.DiversificationFinding the best diversified stocks can be challenging as most stocks operate in only one industry. Although there are conglomerates that own various businesses in different sectors, there are few leading conglomerates out there.Instead, the best diversified stocks are arguably very popular leading ETFs such as the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (VOO). For many investors, finding the best diversified stocks would be to own an ETF like the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (VOO) which includes all 500 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index automatically. The Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (VOO) would also be considered as a contender for ranking among the best diversified stocks given its low costs and its large AUM.Story continuesFor hedge funds trying to find the best diversified stocks, the institutions often purchase individual stocks across multiple different sectors. To find the best diversified stocks, some funds try to buy leading blue chip stocks across all the different sectors. For more on hedge funds, check out 15 Biggest Hedge Funds in the World by AUM if you are interested.Owning blue chips can also help a portfolio. Blue chips are leading companies with substantial competitive advantages. They often have long histories of profitability and returning capital back to shareholders either through dividends or share repurchases.2022 has been a challenging year for the markets as high inflation has caused the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates six times this year. Given the interest rate increases, many stocks have declined as the rising rates have softened demand for many companies. With potentially more interest rates in the future, economists think there could be a recession next year. As a result, there could be more downside if economic data fails to meet expectations.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list, we used FINVIZ.com's categorization of different sectors in the S&amp;P 500 and we picked leading companies from those sectors.We then ranked the companies based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q3 2022.Because we used FINVIZ.com's categorization, stocks such as Alphabet Inc.

Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK)FINVIZ.com Sector: UtilitiesNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is one of the largest energy utilities in the United States that is held by 33 of the 920 hedge funds we track in our database at the end of Q3 2022. In terms of its businesses, Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) has an electric utility that serves 8.2 million costumers and a natural gas business that serves 1.6 million customers. Given the rise in interest rates this year, many utility stocks have declined given that their dividends have become less attractive to some investors given rising Treasury yields. Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is no exception as its shares are down 5.36% year to date. Nevertheless, the company has a wide moat and numerous competitive advantages.Alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is a top stock that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of Q3 2022.9. Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI)FINVIZ.com Sector: Real EstateNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) is a leading shared communications infrastructure REIT that ranks as a top stock in the real estate sector. As of 2022, Crown Castle International Corp.

AFFO per share was $1.85 for the period, up 5% year over year.8. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)FINVIZ.com Sector: IndustrialsNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 53Given the increasing budget of the U.S. military as well as the company's substantial moat, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) ranks as a top stock in the industrials sector. With its year to date rally of 36.6%, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) also ranks among the best performing industrials stocks.Vltava Fund commented on Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT. LMT has a strong and long-term sustainable competitive advantage ensuing from the fact that its products are developed and manufactured at an extremely high level of technology and complexity, its development and contract cycles are measured in decades, and the costs for the government to switch to alternative suppliers are high. Moreover, part of the production is classified as secret, which further takes the wind out of the sails of potential competitors. This results in a very high return on capital and admittedly a slowly but steadily growing business.7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)FINVIZ.com Sector: Consumer DefensiveNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) ranks as a top stock in the consumer defensive sector given the leading retailer's scale and competitive advantages. With inflation higher than before, demand for Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)'s low prices has helped the company grow. In FY23 Q3, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)'s total revenues rose 8.7% year over year to $152.8 billion. Wal-Mart U.S. Q3 comparable sales rose 8.2% year over year and the company continued to gain market share in grocery. The retailing giant's U.S. e-commerce business also grew 16% year over year.6. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)FINVIZ.com Sector: EnergyNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) ranks among the top stocks in the energy sector given the company's scale and profits. With the Russian Ukraine war, energy prices have increased substantially and many of the leading energy companies including Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) have reported substantial profits. If energy prices decline, however, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)'s profits might not be as strong and the sector could underperform.Like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Alphabet Inc.

Defensive stocks generally don't fall as much as the overall market in recessionary times and they might not do as well as the market in more expansionary times. Examples of defensive stocks are leading consumer staples that produce or sell necessities that are in demand throughout the market cycle. Other defensive stocks have very wide moats and substantial competitive advantages that allow them to largely maintain their financial performance during recessions.Given their relatively stable performances, many defensive stocks pay dividends that are pretty consistent. Many of the same defensive stocks have also raised their annual dividends for many consecutive years.

If an industry undergoes secular decline, defensive stocks can underperform. Similarly if a formerly defensive company's management decided to overpay for an acquisition, the stock might not do well either.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.2022 has been a challenging year in the market as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times to fight inflation.

INTU is a leading SaaS software solutions provider to small businesses, consumers, and professional accountants, best known for its QuickBooks accounting and TurboTax tax preparation platforms. INTU recently strengthened its personal finance offerings with the acquisitions of Mint and Credit Karma, and its small business offering with the acquisition of email marketing platform Mailchimp. The company is benefitting from the secular shift to digitization for both businesses and consumers. Given its vast amount of valuable personal finance and tax customer data from its 100 million + customer installed base, the company can apply artificial intelligence to the data to generate actionable intelligence for customers, as well as a large cross-selling opportunity across its products.Given INTU’s less than 5% penetration of its $300 billion market, we believe the company can grow its top-line mid-teens, while improving its high-margin business model of greater than 80% gross margins and greater than 35% EBITDA margin, leading to high-teens EPS growth for the foreseeable future. At about 2% of revenue, the company also requires limited capital expenditures, producing significant and growing FCF, which INTU has used for acquisitions, a small dividend, debt repayment and stock buybacks.”12.

Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake in the company in Q3.Cooper Investments mentioned Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Spin-offs have been a valuable source of uncorrelated return for the portfolio since inception, whether investing in them directly or retaining ownership stakes in the spun-off assets of existing holdings. During the quarter Danaher announced the spin of its Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions group (EAS) expected to close in late 2023. Danaher have been masters of the spin over the last decade and once again this one appears to make sense for both parties. The parent becomes a pure-play life sciences and diagnostics business with higher growth, margins and returns plus more M&amp;A firepower. EAS, with leading positions in water quality through assets like Hach, ChemTreat and Trojan will, as a standalone business, have a more focused M&amp;A strategy and represent an attractive water-related exposure for ESG focused funds. The spinco will still operate with the highly regarded Danaher Business System though (like ‘Fortive Business System’) we expect this to get rebranded while still delivering outstanding financial results.”10. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89The Home Depot, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) shares were more resilient in Q3 as the company continues to perform well and reiterated guidance despite increasing market concerns regarding general inflationary pressures and the impact rising mortgage rates may have on the housing market. We view the longterm prospects and multi-year fundamental outlook as unchanged. Home improvement through repair and remodel is likely to be one of more resilient housing-related industries given the relative attractiveness for consumers to renovate existing homes rather than reset their current low fixed mortgage rate to higher rates that we’re seeing today.”9. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is an American company that specializes in financial information and analytics.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Shares of rating agency and data provider S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) fell 9% during the third quarter due to continued weak debt issuance activity and headwinds to the Indices business from equity market declines. Credit markets were exceptionally soft during the quarter with non-financial corporate bond issuance down 36% for investment grade and down 84% for high yield, reflecting greater investor risk aversion, rising interest rates, and a drop-off in M&amp;A activity. We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year. Over the long term, the company should continue benefiting from the secular trends of increasing bond issuance, growth in passive investing, and demand for data and analytics, while enjoying meaningful and durable competitive advantages that, in our view, are only strengthening following the merger with IHS Markit.”8.

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is an American multinational financial services holding company. In November, Citigroup maintained a Neutral rating on the stock with a $40 price target, highlighting the company's efficient capital returns over the years.Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) holds a nine-year track record of consistent dividend growth, which places it as one of the best dividend stocks on our list.

Berkshire Hathaway was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.Here is what Artisan Partners said about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We made only one new purchase during the quarter, initiating a position in Bank of America (BAC). As one of America’s largest banks, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is second only to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in size and is probably its closest peer. Both are well-run banks, but compared to JPM, since the GFC, BAC has retired more shares, grown EPS faster and currently has more capital and a lower dividend payout. We are attracted to BAC’s strong capital base, high capital generation capacity, large loan loss reserve, low (~50%) loan/deposit ratio, short duration investment securities book, and low dividend payout that provides financial flexibility. BAC has a less volatile earnings stream than JPM with lower capital market sensitive exposures. Additionally, BAC is rigorously stress tested by the Fed every year in quantitative and qualitative fashion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which we hold in the portfolio, owns 12% of BAC. He petitioned the Fed to own more than 10%, so he clearly likes it. Bank stocks were strong gainers in 2021 on the prospects of higher rates boosting net interest margins, but the stocks pulled back in the first half of 2022 on economic concerns. We believe BAC has massive scale advantages, should benefit from increasing interest rates, particularly in the 2-year part of the yield curve, and should grow over time with the economy. The economic environment is highly uncertain, but current consensus includes the provision for losses more than doubling and capital markets activity slowing. Against that backdrop, our purchase price equated to about 8.5X our estimates of “mid-cycle” earnings. With leading businesses, a double-digit ROE, a prudent capital return strategy and a strong balance sheet, we believe this entry point offers a solid long-term value.”6. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is an American multinational investment bank and financial services holding company.

If you want to see more of the best defensive stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Defensive Stocks to Buy Now.Defensive stocks are stocks that generate relatively stable performances regardless of the market cycle. Defensive stocks generally don't fall as much as the overall market in recessionary times and they might not do as well as the market in more expansionary times. Examples of defensive stocks are leading consumer staples that produce or sell necessities that are in demand throughout the market cycle. Other defensive stocks have very wide moats and substantial competitive advantages that allow them to largely maintain their financial performance during recessions.Given their relatively stable performances, many defensive stocks pay dividends that are pretty consistent. Many of the same defensive stocks have also raised their annual dividends for many consecutive years. If interested also check out 12 Best Consumer Staple Stocks.It should be noted that defensive stocks may not always remain defensive stocks because industries and company management constantly change. If an industry undergoes secular decline, defensive stocks can underperform. Similarly if a formerly defensive company's management decided to overpay for an acquisition, the stock might not do well either.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.2022 has been a challenging year in the market as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times to fight inflation. Although October's core inflation data has shown some positive signs that inflation could be peaking, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard recently said he thought interest rates might need to rise to 5% or higher and stay there until into 2024 before the U.S. central bank can begin to normalize its monetary policy again.Story continuesGiven the interest rate increases and the expected economic slowdown in 2023, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 17.5% year to date and the NASDAQ has declined 30.6% year to date.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Defensive Stocks to Buy Now, we took 12 stocks that have defensive qualities that have outperformed the S&amp;P 500's decline of 17.5% year to date in 2022.We then ranked the 12 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q3 2022.12 Best Defensive Stocks to Buy Now12.

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.82bUS$6.10bUS$5.78bUS$6.93bUS$7.40bUS$7.76bUS$8.07bUS$8.35bUS$8.59bUS$8.82bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.86%Est @ 3.99%Est @ 3.39%Est @ 2.97%Est @ 2.67% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$5.4kUS$5.2kUS$4.6kUS$5.1kUS$5.0kUS$4.8kUS$4.7kUS$4.5kUS$4.2kUS$4.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$47bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.0%) = US$146bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$146b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$67bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$114b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$79.0, the company appears about fair value at a 7.8% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Medtronic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.022. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Medtronic, there are three relevant elements you should consider:Risks: Take risks, for example - Medtronic has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does MDT's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

But that doesn't mean long term investors can avoid big losses. To wit, the The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) share price managed to fall 64% over five long years. We certainly feel for shareholders who bought near the top. And we doubt long term believers are the only worried holders, since the stock price has declined 46% over the last twelve months. Furthermore, it's down 19% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. View our latest analysis for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the five years over which the share price declined, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 5.2% each year. Readers should note that the share price has fallen faster than the EPS, at a rate of 19% per year, over the period. This implies that the market was previously too optimistic about the stock. The low P/E ratio of 3.69 further reflects this reticence.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? Take a more thorough look at Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?Investors should note that there's a difference between Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price change, which we've covered above. Arguably the TSR is a more complete return calculation because it accounts for the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested), along with the hypothetical value of any discounted capital that have been offered to shareholders. Dividends have been really beneficial for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber shareholders, and that cash payout explains why its total shareholder loss of 62%, over the last 5 years, isn't as bad as the share price return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber shareholders are down 46% for the year. Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 14%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 10% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber better, we need to consider many other factors.

If you want to read about some more stocks in the Gates portfolio, go directly to Bill Gates Portfolio Stock List: Top 5 Stocks.Bill Gates is one of the most well-known personalities in the world of finance even though his claim to fame is in the software business. This is because Gates has successfully built an investing empire over the past few decades that has been one of the best performers on Wall Street. Gates, who left his role on the board of Microsoft, one of the largest tech companies in the world, in May 2020 has a personal net worth of more than $105 billion. The moves that his hedge fund makes in the market are heavily scrutinized by the media.Gates founded Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, the investment arm of the Gates Foundation, in 2000. His personal money manager, Michael Larson, has since been overseeing the equity investments of the fund. The value of the equity portfolio of the fund was close to $33 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2022. The fund has a history of investing in firms with a long-term strategy in mind. This strategy has slowly started changing in the past few quarters as Larson prepares for a possible economic crisis. Between June and September, the portfolio value of the fund increased by more than $16 billion. During this time, the fund made new purchases in two stocks, additional purchases in seven stocks, sold out of one stock, and reduced holdings in one stock. The top ten holdings of the fund comprise over 96% of the portfolio. Some of the top stocks in the portfolio at the end of September included Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), and Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:CVNA) with 6.8 million shares worth more than $138.6 million. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Steel City Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“As I write, Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA), a long-time short, is circling the drain. After reporting earnings, shares have been roughly cut in half while the company’s bonds are now priced anywhere from 35- to 45 cents on the dollar, with yields ranging from 25% to 40%. While the shares already experienced a steep decline during the past year, the post-earnings sell-off appears to reflect investors finally acknowledging the company’s near-term liquidity issues. Raising capital – debt or equity – seems unlikely, if not impossible. Bulls had been holding on to the hope CVNA would meet its stated “goal” of generating “significantly positive EBITDA in FY 2023,” but management walked back that aspiration last week. I always thought the word “goal” reflected squishy language that never carried the same weight as “guidance” and drew conclusions accordingly. The difference is much the same as me telling my wife I have a “goal” of having washboard abs vs. “guidance” that I will have them by swimsuit season. The language was deliberate (and probably highly lawyered), and in my estimation, reflected an effort to give bulls something to cling on to without the company exposing itself to a lawsuit when they (inevitably) missed.”7.

(NYSE:CCI) stock and lowered the price target to $150 from $202, noting that the company's third-quarter results were in-line and set a more conservative target multiple given the macroeconomic backdrop.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Camas, Washington-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) with 3 million shares worth more than $434 million. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Crown Castle Inc.

Crown Castle is the leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure in the U.S. with a portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers. The stock underperformed as, driven by rising interest rates, investors rotated away from defensive into more value-oriented sectors.

If you want to see more of the top stocks to buy in different sectors, go directly to Top 5 Stocks to Buy in 10 Different Sectors.Diversification when done correctly can improve a portfolio as it can help smooth out the bumps that happen during challenging investment environments.If one company or one sector faces headwinds, for example, owning leading stocks in many different sectors can potentially reduce a portfolio's volatility. As a result, diversification when done correctly can help reduce sector and company specific risk.Diversification does not reduce systemic risk and there will always be risks that diversification will not be able to remove. If the market crashes, many stocks in many different sectors will decline.Generally, however, many investors believe in the power of diversification. Many quantitative hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies own holdings in thousands of different stocks.In terms of diversification, there are many different types including diversification through asset class. A classic example is where an investor invests 60% in leading equities and 40% in leading bonds. Another example of diversification is by diversifying through industry sector. By owning leading shares in all the sectors, a bad performance in one sector might not affect a portfolio all that much.DiversificationFinding the best diversified stocks can be challenging as most stocks operate in only one industry. Although there are conglomerates that own various businesses in different sectors, there are few leading conglomerates out there.Instead, the best diversified stocks are arguably very popular leading ETFs such as the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (VOO). For many investors, finding the best diversified stocks would be to own an ETF like the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (VOO) which includes all 500 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index automatically. The Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (VOO) would also be considered as a contender for ranking among the best diversified stocks given its low costs and its large AUM.Story continuesFor hedge funds trying to find the best diversified stocks, the institutions often purchase individual stocks across multiple different sectors. To find the best diversified stocks, some funds try to buy leading blue chip stocks across all the different sectors. For more on hedge funds, check out 15 Biggest Hedge Funds in the World by AUM if you are interested.Owning blue chips can also help a portfolio. Blue chips are leading companies with substantial competitive advantages. They often have long histories of profitability and returning capital back to shareholders either through dividends or share repurchases.2022 has been a challenging year for the markets as high inflation has caused the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates six times this year. Given the interest rate increases, many stocks have declined as the rising rates have softened demand for many companies. With potentially more interest rates in the future, economists think there could be a recession next year. As a result, there could be more downside if economic data fails to meet expectations.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list, we used FINVIZ.com's categorization of different sectors in the S&amp;P 500 and we picked leading companies from those sectors.We then ranked the companies based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q3 2022.Because we used FINVIZ.com's categorization, stocks such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) that can be categorized as tech sector stocks make it to our list as leading stocks in different sectors.Top 10 Stocks to Buy in 10 Different Sectors10. Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK)FINVIZ.com Sector: UtilitiesNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is one of the largest energy utilities in the United States that is held by 33 of the 920 hedge funds we track in our database at the end of Q3 2022. In terms of its businesses, Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) has an electric utility that serves 8.2 million costumers and a natural gas business that serves 1.6 million customers. Given the rise in interest rates this year, many utility stocks have declined given that their dividends have become less attractive to some investors given rising Treasury yields. Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is no exception as its shares are down 5.36% year to date. Nevertheless, the company has a wide moat and numerous competitive advantages.Alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) is a top stock that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of Q3 2022.9. Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI)FINVIZ.com Sector: Real EstateNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) is a leading shared communications infrastructure REIT that ranks as a top stock in the real estate sector. As of 2022, Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) has over 40,000 towers, around 85,000 route miles of fibers, and around 5,000 employees. Given new advancements like 5G and edge computing, demand for Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI)'s real estate could remain strong. In the third quarter, Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) reported site rental revenues of $1.568 billion, up 8% year over year. AFFO per share was $1.85 for the period, up 5% year over year.8. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)FINVIZ.com Sector: IndustrialsNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 53Given the increasing budget of the U.S. military as well as the company's substantial moat, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) ranks as a top stock in the industrials sector. With its year to date rally of 36.6%, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) also ranks among the best performing industrials stocks.Vltava Fund commented on Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,LMT is one of the world’s largest aerospace and defence companies. The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT. LMT has a strong and long-term sustainable competitive advantage ensuing from the fact that its products are developed and manufactured at an extremely high level of technology and complexity, its development and contract cycles are measured in decades, and the costs for the government to switch to alternative suppliers are high. Moreover, part of the production is classified as secret, which further takes the wind out of the sails of potential competitors. This results in a very high return on capital and admittedly a slowly but steadily growing business.7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)FINVIZ.com Sector: Consumer DefensiveNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) ranks as a top stock in the consumer defensive sector given the leading retailer's scale and competitive advantages. With inflation higher than before, demand for Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)'s low prices has helped the company grow. In FY23 Q3, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)'s total revenues rose 8.7% year over year to $152.8 billion. Wal-Mart U.S. Q3 comparable sales rose 8.2% year over year and the company continued to gain market share in grocery. The retailing giant's U.S. e-commerce business also grew 16% year over year.6. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)FINVIZ.com Sector: EnergyNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) ranks among the top stocks in the energy sector given the company's scale and profits. With the Russian Ukraine war, energy prices have increased substantially and many of the leading energy companies including Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) have reported substantial profits. If energy prices decline, however, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)'s profits might not be as strong and the sector could underperform.Like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are among the top stocks to buy in different sectors that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of the third quarter.Click to continue reading and see Top 5 Stocks to Buy in 10 Different Sectors.Suggested articles:Bill Gates’ Top 10 Dividend StocksWarren Buffett’s Stock Portfolio and 10 Newest Investments in 202215 Biggest ESG Companies in the WorldDisclosure: None.

(NYSE:CCI) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Crown Castle The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Crown CastleIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP &amp; COO of Fiber, Christopher Levendos, sold US$2.1m worth of shares at a price of US$193 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$139. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 5.91k shares for US$843k. But they sold 19.50k shares for US$3.7m. Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Crown Castle shares, than buying. The average sell price was around US$190. We are not joyful about insider selling. But we note that the selling, on average, was at well above the recently traded price of US$139. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Story continuesCrown Castle Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at Crown Castle. Not only was there no selling that we can see, but they collectively bought US$397k worth of shares. This could be interpreted as suggesting a positive outlook.Does Crown Castle Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Crown Castle insiders own about US$334m worth of shares (which is 0.6% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Crown Castle Insiders?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchases. On the other hand the transaction history, over the last year, isn't so positive. The high levels of insider ownership, and the recent buying by some insiders suggests they are well aligned and optimistic. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Crown Castle.

Today, the company is focused on advancing its approved medicines and conducting a wide-ranging clinical development program with the aim of addressing evolving unmet needs in hematologic oncology. Among Merck’s research efforts are studies evaluating KEYTRUDA, coformulations of novel checkpoint inhibitors with KEYTRUDA, and two investigational medicines as monotherapy or in combination in a range of blood cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and B-cell lymphomas.Story continuesAbout favezelimab (MK-4280)Favezelimab is an investigational anti-lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) antibody. LAG-3 is a cell surface immunomodulatory receptor expressed on various immune cells that down-regulates T cell proliferation and activation. Favezelimab aims to restore T cell effector function by preventing LAG-3 from binding to its primary ligand, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. Favezelimab coformulated with pembrolizumab (MK-4280A) is being evaluated across multiple solid tumors and in patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma whose disease has progressed on prior anti-PD-1 therapy (KEYFORM-008, NCT05508867).About zilovertamab vedotin (MK-2140)Zilovertamab vedotin is an investigational antibody-drug conjugate that targets receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1). ROR1 is a transmembrane protein that is overexpressed in multiple hematologic malignancies. Merck is committed to research with zilovertamab vedotin across B-cell malignancies and is establishing a robust program of clinical trials under the name WAVELINE. A Phase 2/3 study is underway in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (WAVELINE-003, NCT05139017).About nemtabrutinib (MK-1026)Nemtabrutinib is an investigational oral, reversible, non-covalent Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that suppresses oncogenic B-cell receptor signaling with activity against wild-type BTK and BTK pathway mutants. Nemtabrutinib aims to address a common mechanism of resistance with currently available irreversible, covalent BTK inhibitors by binding in an alternative way to the BTK protein. Merck is committed to research with nemtabrutinib across B-cell malignancies and is establishing a robust program of clinical trials under the name BELLWAVE. A Phase 3 study is currently underway in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma without TP53 aberrations (BELLWAVE-008, NCT05624554).Merck’s focus on cancerOur goal is to translate breakthrough science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide. At Merck, the potential to bring new hope to people with cancer drives our purpose and supporting accessibility to our cancer medicines is our commitment. As part of our focus on cancer, Merck is committed to exploring the potential of immuno-oncology with one of the largest development programs in the industry across more than 30 tumor types. We also continue to strengthen our portfolio through strategic acquisitions and are prioritizing the development of several promising oncology candidates with the potential to improve the treatment of advanced cancers. For more information about our oncology clinical trials, visit www.merck.com/clinicaltrials.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.MelanomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.KEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies.

The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

The outperformance was due to higher-than-expected contributions from a couple of segments.Adjusted EBITDA from the Others segment totaled $127 million, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $337 million from the West unit beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $314 million.Meanwhile, in the quarter ended Sep 30, Williams’ revenues of $3.02 billion outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.87 billion and also beat last year’s third-quarter revenues of $2.47 billion. The outperformance could be attributed to increased product sales.Adjusted EBITDA was $1.64 billion in the quarter under review, reflecting an increase of 15.3% from the corresponding period of 2021. Cash flow from operations totaled $1.49 billion, up 78.7% from the prior-year period.Segmental AnalysisTransmission &amp; Gulf of Mexico: Comprising WMB’s massive Transco pipeline system and Northwest Pipeline, the segment generated adjusted EBITDA of $671 million, rising 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.This unit’s performance was largely driven by higher service revenues from Transco’s Leidy South expansion project and reduced hurricane impacts on the Gulf Coast region.West: This segment focuses on the gathering and processing of assets in the Western region of the United States. It delivered an adjusted EBITDA of $337 million, 31.1% higher than the $257 million recorded in the year-earlier quarter.The improvement in results was primarily due to higher commodity-based rates and higher Haynesville gathering volumes, including contributions from Trace Midstream acquired in April.Northeast G&amp;P: The segment is engaged in natural gas gathering and processing, along with the NGL fractionation business in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions.The unit generated adjusted EBITDA of $464 million, up almost 5% from the prior-year quarter’s $442 million. This uptick was driven by higher service revenues from Ohio Valley Midstream.Gas &amp; NGL Marketing Services: This unit generated adjusted EBITDA of $38 million, up 11.8% from the prior-year quarter’s $34 million.  The result of this segment benefited from stable commodity margins, which included the write-downs of inventory to lower period-end market prices.Story continuesCosts, Capex &amp; Balance SheetIn the reported quarter, total costs and expenses of $2.2 billion rose by almost 3.8% compared with the year-ago quarter’s figure of $2.12 billion.Williams’ total capital investment was $950 million in the third quarter, up from $469 million a year ago.

""Safety should be the focus, not a date, safety,"" she said.Boeing is seeking an extension from Congress of a Dec. 27 deadline imposing a new safety standard for modern cockpit alerts after two fatal 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia and led to the plane's 20-month grounding.A timely FAA response could help address concerns among some other lawmakers who oppose Boeing's request, potentially opening the way for an extension to be granted following months of discussions.In a previously unreported Nov. 23 letter to the FAA seen by Reuters, Cantwell sought additional information on its certification of the Boeing 737 MAX fleet and compliance with the crew alerting requirements"" by Dec. 5.After Dec. 27, all planes must have modern cockpit alerting systems to be certified by the FAA, which could put the two new MAX planes future in jeopardy.Cantwell's letter asked ""to the extent FAA has identified safety deficiencies with 737 MAX’s flight crew alerting system, please describe FAA’s plans to immediately address these safety concerns.""The FAA said it ""was working on a response"" to Cantwell's letter.Lawmakers are discussing whether to include the provision in the House version of an annual defense bill, sources told Reuters.Story continuesRelatives of those killed in the crashes vehemently oppose to waiving the alerting requirements.""How many people have to die for Boeing to be required to follow the law and install safe, modern flight crew alerting in their aircraft?"" Michael Stumo, whose daughter died in the Ethiopian Airlines MAX crash, asked on Wednesday.Boeing declined to comment but has said it is safer to have one common cockpit alerting system for all versions of the 737.Acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen told reporters earlier this month he did not view either version of the MAX as better.

It's going to take hard work and it's going to take the work of everyone, not just the government,"" Raimondo said at a speech at MIT.She said the United States is ""not seeking the decoupling in any way of our economy from that of China's.""She added that ""cutting edge technology, that China wants to get its hands on to put into military capacity...

In September, Boeing said it would begin to remarket some 737 MAX jets earmarked for Chinese customers citing ongoing geopolitical tensions.Raimondo said on Tuesday ""we need to continue to do business with China and trade with China supports American jobs.""

(NYSE:BA) has faced plenty of serious setbacks in recent years, from the disastrous and deadly rollout of the 737 Max to the abortive attempts to launch the glitchy Starliner spacecraft.While the venerable aerospace company has endured much in its efforts to reestablish both its reputation and a firm financial footing, certain business segments have continued to be plagued with issues. Perhaps the most troublesome among these of late is Boeing Defense, Space and Security (BDS), the companys struggling defense business.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with BA. Click here to check it out. BA 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of BAPeter Lynch Chart of BAChronic underperformanceThis segment has underperformed compared to the rest of the company for years. Remarkably, the segment showed virtually no growth at all from 2018 through 2021. In 2018, the segment brought in $26.4 billion in revenue; in 2021, it brought in $26.5 billion. Things have failed to improve in 2022; year to date, the segment has brought in just $22.8 billion in revenue.Things look even worse for BDS upon review of the segments margins, which fell from 6.3% in 2018 to 5.9% in 2021. A number of charges booked this year have sent margins deeply into the red, coming in at -13.4% through the first three quarters of 2022, representing a 12-month trailing net loss of nearly $3 billion.While one might be tempted to blame the exacerbated troubles of 2022 on idiosyncratic events and one-off charges, this is simply an inadequate explanation for a business segment that is clearly experiencing severe, long-term pathologies. Aerospace analyst Dhierin Bechai made this point forcefully in a Nov. 18 research note:The reduction in revenue reflects charges that Boeing took in the third quarter bringing twelve-month trailing losses to $3 billion. What's more worrisome is that Boeing actually took those charges. Normally those charges are one-off items, but with Boeing they have become standard business practice. The Defense segment normally should be a segment with margins in the 10% to 12% range. However, driven by charges, Boeing has not been able to deliver satisfying margins for at least the past five years and that likely is also a reason for Boeing to restructure the defense segment. Doing so could shave off overhead costs, although Boeing has not discussed any potential savings as part of the restructuring.Story continuesBDS has failed both to grow meaningfully as a business segment, and to deliver margins remotely close to the industry average. Indeed, even before the recent reversals over the past year, Boeings defense business margins were barely half of those enjoyed by its principal rivals.A much overdue reorganizationAfter years spent either publicly discounting or outright ignoring the problems proliferating within its defense business, Boeing appears at last to have woken up to the issue in earnest. On Nov. 17, the company announced a sweeping reorganization of BDS that aims to accelerate operational discipline, program quality, safety and performance.The restructuring was kickstarted with the immediate halving of the number of divisions within the defense business unit from eight to four, consisting of: Vertical Lift; Mobility, Surveillance and Bombing; Air Dominance; and Space, Intelligence and Weapon Systems. This consolidation comes after years of failure to adapt to changing market conditions and industry demands. In a statement accompanying the restructuring announcement on Nov. 17, BDS CEO Ted Colbert expressed high hopes for Boeings reorganized defense business:I am confident this reorganization will drive greater and more simplified integration and collaboration across Boeing Defense, Space and Security. These changes will help accelerate operational discipline and program quality and performance, while stabilizing our development and production programs. These are necessary steps to put BDS on the path to stronger, profitable growth.The reorganization should help Boeing reduce unnecessary overhead, cut costs and streamline operations within the BDS business, which ought to help it stabilize itself financially, as well as lay the groundwork for future margin expansion. However, many lingering issues remain that will have to be addressed if BDS is truly going to rise from the ashes bigger and stronger than ever.Getting cost overruns under control will have to be a key priority, which BDS leadership has acknowledged. This is especially important with regard to the numerous fixed-cost development programs in BDSs portfolio, many of which have suffered from severe delays in recent years, such as its next-generation military tanker aircraft, which I have discussed previously, and the new Air Force One development.My takeBoeing Defense, Space and Security has weighed on its parent company for years, but there is finally a glimmer of hope that a turnaround is nigh. While the immediate and deliberate actions to streamline the BDS organization are a good sign for the future, in my opinion, it is still only a first step - a good first step, but a first step nonetheless.Boeing has faced many struggles as an organization. Its turnaround efforts to date have shown some promise thus far, but I see a difficult road still ahead. In my assessment, investors interested in this name should be laser-focused on these turnaround efforts, both within BDS and across the Boeing organization. Their success or failure will likely set the course for the venerable aerospace company for years to come.Trade carefully!This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this airplane builder have returned +22.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, which Boeing falls in, has gained 2.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Boeing is expected to post earnings of $0.40 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +105.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of -$8.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.63 indicates a change of +129.9% from what Boeing is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.9%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Boeing is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for BA _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Boeing, the consensus sales estimate of $19.42 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +31.3%. The $66.04 billion and $82.36 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6% and +24.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryBoeing reported revenues of $15.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.4%. EPS of -$6.18 for the same period compares with -$0.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -8.85%. The EPS surprise was -61700%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Boeing is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Boeing. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Initiatives toward a reduced-carbon economy continue to drive the demand for PWR’s services and depict incremental growth opportunities. These factors have helped the company to gain 26.1% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 7.2% rise.Earlier this month, Quanta reported impressive financial numbers for third-quarter 2022. Adjusted earnings and revenues increased 19.6% and 33% year over year, respectively. The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in nine of the 10 consecutive quarters. Moreover, revenues surpassed the consensus mark in seven of the 10 consecutive quarters.Notably, Quanta achieved strong double-digit growth of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share, which is reflective of the benefits of operations portfolio strategy and strategic capital deployment.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company remains vulnerable to supply-chain disruptions, regulatory challenges, and risks like project delays and stiff competition. Also, lower operating margins are concerning. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Factors Favoring the StockBacklog Solid: The company ended third-quarter 2022 with a total backlog of $20.87 billion and a 12-month backlog of $12.43 billion. This compares favorably with $17.02 billion of the total backlog and $9.76 billion of a 12-month backlog a year ago. This demonstrates the strength of its core operations. Quanta’s optimism stems from healthy backlog levels, which are expected to grow further.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings of $6.85 per share calls for 9.4% year-over-year growth.Energy Transition Trend to Drive Growth: The development and deployment of technology solutions across the full spectrum of decarbonization efforts, including carbon management mitigation and compliance consulting, as well as all facets of infrastructure for providing carbon-free energy solutions, will benefit the company going forward. PWR has been experiencing growing demand for renewable generation and infrastructure solutions for 2023 and beyond, giving continued confidence in its multi-year financial targets.Quanta remains uniquely positioned to capitalize on the megatrends and opportunities to lead the energy transition and enable technological development with initiatives such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure and undergrounding of electrical infrastructure gaining momentum.As a result, Quanta envisions delivering a 10% organic adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) and more than 15% adjusted EPS (CAGR) through 2026.Electric Power Operations Strong: Electric Power operations continued to perform well from a top-line perspective. Segmental revenues, which comprise revenues from base business activities, including communications operations, grew 20.6% in the first nine months of 2022, 17.9% in 2021 and 9.1% in 2020 year over year. The solid performance was backed by base business activities, courtesy of robust spending by electric utilities on grid modernization and infrastructure hardening, particularly in the western United States, and gas utilities on distribution system modernization and safety programs.As of Sep 30, 2022, the segment’s 12-month backlog was $7.19 billion (up from $6.11 billion a year ago) and the total backlog was $12.98 billion (up from $11.49 billion reported in the prior-year quarter). Prospects of the Electric Power segment remain robust, given customers’ investment in grid modernization programs intended to address the aging infrastructure, strengthen systems for resiliency against extreme weather conditions and support long-term economic growth.Story continuesHurdlesThe company’s operating margin in the third quarter of 2022 declined 100 basis points year over year. This was due to lower margins in Electric as well as Renewable Energy units.The Electric segment's operating income margins in third-quarter 2022 declined due to lower emergency restoration services revenues and the completion of a large transmission project, which contributed to lower equipment utilization, and fixed and indirect cost absorption, as well as less favorable results associated with normal variability in overall project timing and project mix.The Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions unit’s third-quarter operating margin also contracted due to lower margins on a large renewable transmission project in Canada and a change in the mix of work due to acquisitions, and less favorable results associated with normal variability in overall project timing.Supply-chain disruptions, inflation, COVID-19 and regulatory uncertainties are other concerns.3 Better-Ranked Construction Stocks Hogging the LimelightSome better-ranked stocks, which warrant a look in the Construction sector, include:EMCOR Group, Inc. EME — carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present — is one of the leading providers of mechanical and electrical construction, industrial and energy infrastructure, and building services for a diverse range of businesses.EME’s expected earnings growth rates for 2022 and 2023 are 10.2% and 17%, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year and next-year earnings has improved 0.4% and 3.3%, respectively, over the past 30 days.Sterling Infrastructure, Inc.

The work related to this deal will be carried out at multiple locations across the United States, with the majority in Camden, AR.The work is scheduled to be completed by Sep 30, 2027. This contract award also benefits a foreign military sale to the United Kingdom.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin is a prime defense contractor for defense arsenals and ammunition. It enjoys a lucrative position in manufacturing military missiles. In this context, its Trident II (D5) is the latest generation of the U.S. Navy's submarine-launched fleet ballistic missiles, following the highly successful Polaris, Poseidon and Trident I C4 programs.Trident II (D5) is a three-stage, solid-propellant, inertial-guided ballistic missile developed by Lockheed Martin. The missile can carry multiple independently targeted reentry bodies for a maximum range of more than 7,360 km. The missile cannot be tracked when it is being operated as it has a sea-based deterrent.Such remarkable features have aided its demand in the military landscape. Its strong demand can be gauged from 14 U.S. Navy Ohio-class submarines with American warheads and four Royal Navy Vanguard-class submarines with British warheads equipped with this missile.Per the report from Mordor Intelligence, the missiles and missile defense system market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 4.9% during the 2022-2027 period. Such an expanding market size is likely to benefit LMT as it enjoys a solid position in the military missile market.Peer GrowthProminent defense majors that have been manufacturing missiles for the defense industry and are likely to enjoy the perks of the increased demand are as follows:Story continuesNorthrop Grumman NOC is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, subsystems and components. To strengthen its position in the missile market, Northrop had acquired Orbital ATK in 2018, which used to be one of the industry leaders in providing missile components across air, sea and land-based systems.Northrop Grumman has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 2.9%.

As part of the contract, Pratt &amp; Whitney will offer annual sustainment for the F135 propulsion system, including recurring sustainment support and other program and management services involving the F135 propulsion system.The work related to this deal will be carried out at multiple locations across the United States, with the majority of the work to be executed in East Hartford, CT. It is scheduled to be completed by May 2023.Raytheon’s Growth ProspectsCombat aircraft witnessed a surge in demand with the rapid rise in political risks and global terrorism. In this context, F-35 jets, built by America’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin LMT, enjoy a lucrative position in the combat aircraft arena and witness a steady flow of orders involving the aircraft from the U.S. Army, seven international partner countries and eight Foreign Military Sales customers.Lockheed Martin delivered 841 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 271 jets in the backlog as of September 2022. The strong international demand for F-35 in the first three quarters of 2022 resulted in multiple order wins for LMT and RTX.Further, the production of F-35 jets is expected to continue for many years ahead, given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy.Consequently, Pratt &amp; Whitney, which builds F-35’s engine, may expect to witness more order inflows for the F-35 engine and its propulsion system in the coming days, like the latest one.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So while NIKE (NYSE:NKE) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for NIKE:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$6.2b ÷ (US$41b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to August 2022).So, NIKE has an ROCE of 21%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Luxury industry average of 17%. See our latest analysis for NIKE roceIn the above chart we have measured NIKE's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From NIKE's ROCE Trend?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at NIKE doesn't inspire confidence. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 26%. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.The Key TakeawayBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by NIKE's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Since the stock has gained an impressive 92% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Story continuesIf you're still interested in NIKE it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

This compares to earnings of $0.02 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 200%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this developer of directed sound technologies used by the military and police would post a loss of $0.02 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.02, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Genasys , which belongs to the Zacks Consumer Services - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $16.04 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.81%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $15.05 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Genasys shares have lost about 21.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -17%.What's Next for Genasys?While Genasys has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Genasys: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

206,0956fd25-0362-31ed-a228-b319eb92beb1,VFC,2022-12-01,An Intrinsic Calculation For V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) Suggests It's 42% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-v-f-corporation-183702517.html,1669833422,STORY,['VFC'],"[Does the November share price for V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for V.F The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$495.9mUS$1.40bUS$1.18bUS$1.24bUS$1.70bUS$1.79bUS$1.87bUS$1.94bUS$2.00bUS$2.06bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 5.45%Est @ 4.41%Est @ 3.68%Est @ 3.17%Est @ 2.81% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.1% US$455US$1.2kUS$911US$873US$1.1kUS$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$969US$916US$864(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.4bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.1%– 2.0%) = US$30bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$30b÷ ( 1 + 9.1%)10= US$12bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$22b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$32.5, the company appears quite good value at a 42% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at V.F as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.385. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?""

Local partners run the gamut from government agencies and community-based organizations to business groups and nonprofit lenders.Altogether, Wells Fargo has targeted eight markets for its WORTH program and aims to support 40,000 new homeowners of color.""The vision of the WORTH program is to harness the collective expertise, reach and action of housing advocates to enable more Black, African American, Hispanic and other underserved individuals to achieve homeownership,"" said Otis Rolley, president of the Wells Fargo Foundation. ""This funding is a natural extension of our long collaboration with LISC, which shares our focus on advancing greater racial equity and wealth building.""Nationally, 74.6 percent of white households are homeowners, but just 48.7 percent of Hispanic households and 45.2 percent of Black households own their homes. In fact, the gap between Black and white homeowners is greater today than it was in 1960, before the Fair Housing Act made redlining illegal.""The WORTH collaborations are meant to upend decades of destructive practices that have disadvantaged people of color,"" said Denise Scott, LISC president. ""They will create opportunities for families to buy homes and build wealth, while also demonstrating what really works to break down racial barriers and strengthen local economies. The positive ripple effect will benefit communities long into the future,"" she said.Story continuesLISC is tapping WORTH funding to address multiple facets of housing equity, all tailored to local circumstances. In Houston, for instance, the WORTH partners are working to expand the types of available housing, while also connecting programs related to savings, debt management, and mortgage lending.In New York, the WORTH strategy includes access to capital, as well as policy and financing plans to help renters purchase their apartments when building owners are ready to sell. And in Richmond, the collaborative is working to expand access to flexible mortgage products, while also addressing construction costs and local policy challenges. All three strategies also include significant outreach to homebuyers, offering financial counseling and other support.In addition to the three collaboratives it is leading, LISC is also participating as a partner in WORTH plans for Chicago and Philadelphia. Homeownership is a critical part of LISC's national efforts to narrow gaps in health, wealth and opportunity, particularly through Project 10X, a $1 billion commitment to reducing racial disparities.LISC and Wells Fargo have worked together for more than three decades to expand economic opportunity for underserved communities, investing more than $1.7 billion in affordable housing, economic development and entrepreneurship.About LISCLISC is one of the country's largest community development organizations, helping forge vibrant, resilient communities across America. We work with residents and partners to close systemic gaps in health, wealth and opportunity and advance racial equity so that people and places can thrive.

(NYSE: PFE) today announced formation of a new Vant to develop and commercialize PF-06480605 (now RVT-3101). RVT-3101 is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting TL1A, which is currently in Phase 2b development in ulcerative colitis (UC). The Vant has the exclusive option to collaborate with Pfizer on a next-generation TL1A directed antibody which recently entered Phase 1. RVT-3101 is a potential first-in-class agent that targets both inflammatory and fibrotic pathways by inhibiting TL1A, which has been shown to modulate the location and severity of inflammation and fibrosis by stimulating TH1 and TH17 pathways, in addition to activating fibroblasts. As such, RVT-3101 has the potential to provide greater efficacy by hitting multiple inflammatory pathways as well as fibrotic pathways.RVT-3101 has been evaluated in an earlier Phase 2 study (TUSCANY) in 50 patients, and is being evaluated in a large global Phase 2b study (TUSCANY-2) in 245 adult participants with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The induction portion of TUSCANY-2 is complete, and the maintenance portion remains ongoing.“Our internally discovered antibody against TL1A, could potentially be the first agent to bring biomarker-selected precision medicine to people living with inflammatory bowel disease,” said Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer’s Chief Scientific Officer, President, Worldwide Research, Development and Medical. “We are very excited about the preliminary data from the TUSCANY-2 study and for this new Vant to drive the advancement of this asset. At the same time, it enables Pfizer to bring additional innovative breakthrough medicines and vaccines to patients in need more quickly, allowing us to serve more people.”Story continues“We believe in RVT-3101’s potential to transform the inflammatory bowel disease landscape, which has long been in need of new, innovative therapies with greater efficacy,” said Mayukh Sukhatme, President and Chief Investment Officer of Roivant. “We are excited about this collaboration with Pfizer on a potential first-in-class program, which we intend to pursue in both ulcerative colitis and in additional inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. TUSCANY-2 builds on the earlier TUSCANY data with many firsts for the class – TUSCANY-2 is the first study with subcutaneous efficacy data and the first dose-ranging study – and is among the largest Phase 2b studies ever conducted in the indication. We are encouraged by the preliminary data and look forward to presenting our data and to seeing other results from the class.”Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. It is estimated that up to 2 million US adults suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases, which include ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. There is significant unmet treatment need for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. High rates of treatment failure mean that approximately 50% of patients are cycling off a given therapy within 6 to 12 months and are unlikely to achieve sustained remission. The commercial markets for these diseases for advanced therapies is nearly $15 billion per year in the US alone and growing. Available treatments have very low remission rates, and thus there is a large need for an efficacious and safe therapy. Terms of CollaborationA new Vant or Roivant subsidiary has been created to develop and fund these programs. The Vant will be fully responsible for funding global development of RVT-3101 in UC and in additional inflammatory and fibrotic diseases and holds commercial rights in the US and Japan. Pfizer owns a 25% equity position in the Vant and maintains commercial rights outside of the US and Japan as well as representation on the company’s Board of Directors.In addition, the Vant has the exclusive option to collaborate with Pfizer on a next-generation TL1A directed antibody which recently entered Phase 1. The Vant will have the right to enter into an agreement for global development with a 50/50 cost share as well as co-commercialization rights with Pfizer prior to Phase 2 (expected in 2025).About Roivant SciencesRoivant's mission is to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients by treating every inefficiency as an opportunity.

The vaccine is now also approved by WHO in adults aged 18 years and older as a booster dose.Novavax’s COVID vaccine was granted EUL by WHO last year in December for use as a primary series in adults.The EUL by WHO assesses and lists unlicensed vaccines, therapeutics and in vitro diagnostics to expedite their availability to people affected by a public health emergency. The medications and treatments that are granted EUL meet WHO’s standards for quality, safety and efficacy.

Data from the study demonstrated 80% overall clinical efficacy in adults at the time when the Delta variant was dominating in the United States.The EUL for the booster dose is based on data from multiple phase II studies conducted in Australia, South Africa and the U.K., which evaluated a booster dose of NVX-CoV2373 in adult participants. Data from these studies showed that a third dose of the vaccine generated increased immune responses compared with the data observed in late-stage studies evaluating Nuvaxovid. The vaccine also induced a robust antibody response when used as a heterologous booster dose.Some other COVID vaccines which have been granted EUL by WHO include Moderna MRNA and Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX. from their COVID vaccine product sales.Story continuesThe Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have received full approval for adults in the United States. While Moderna’s vaccine is approved for adults aged 18 years and older, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is approved for individuals aged 12 years and older.

If you want to read about some more healthcare stocks, go directly to Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Healthcare Stocks to Consider.The healthcare sector is being forced to deal with new challenges related to valuation and access to capital as the COVID-19 pandemic recedes. Even as the priorities in the sector change, the healthcare industry remains one of the key drivers of growth for the United States economy with giants like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) contributing to a stellar valuation that is expected to increase to $1.7 trillion in value by 2030. The healthcare industry is also one of the safest picks for a retirement stock portfolio. This is indicated by the historical performance of the sector during times of crisis. A recent Endpoint survey reveals that 66% of investors think that biotech will outperform the broader market in 2022. When viewed in context of rising rates and soaring inflation, two factors that have pummeled the market and slowed growth in recent months, these sentiments highlight the reputation of the health industry among elite investors. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the healthcare sector and have established business models that have demonstrated historical resilience against inflationary headwinds were selected for the list. We preferred companies that either pay strong dividends or are working on projects with long-term growth prospects. These stocks are also popular among the 920 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of the third quarter. Retirement Stock Portfolio: Safe Healthcare Stocks to Consider11.

The company’s 2022 guidance was in line with Street expectations, calling for 9% to 11% operational revenue growth and modest margin expansion despite heavy investment in core growth drivers.”7.

Here is what the fund said:“CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.” Click to continue reading and see Retirement Stock Portfolio: 5 Safe Healthcare Stocks to Consider. Suggested Articles:10 Best Biotech Stocks To BuyObama Stock Portfolio: 10-Year Returns11 Best Covid Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

216,1a5519ff-3efa-3187-9885-c34cee36c794,FOXA,2022-12-01,Can Mixed Fundamentals Have A Negative Impact on Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) Current Share Price Momentum?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mixed-fundamentals-negative-impact-fox-165956769.html,1669827596,STORY,['FOXA'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Fox's (NASDAQ:FOXA) stock increased significantly by 10.0% over the past month. However, we wonder if the company's inconsistent financials would have any adverse impact on the current share price momentum. In this article, we decided to focus on Fox's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Fox How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Fox is:9.7% = US$1.1b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.10 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Fox's Earnings Growth And 9.7% ROEWhen you first look at it, Fox's ROE doesn't look that attractive. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 12%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the five year net income decline of 9.0% seen by Fox was probably the result of it having a lower ROE. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. For example, it is possible that the business has allocated capital poorly or that the company has a very high payout ratio.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Fox's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 1.1% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Fox's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Fox Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Fox's low three-year median payout ratio of 19% (or a retention ratio of 81%) over the last three years should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth but the company's earnings have actually shrunk. This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For instance, the business has faced some headwinds.Moreover, Fox has been paying dividends for four years, which is a considerable amount of time, suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer consistent dividends even though earnings have been shrinking. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 18% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Fox's future ROE will rise to 15% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOverall, we have mixed feelings about Fox. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

If you want to read about some more internet retail stocks, go directly to 5 Internet Retail Stocks To Buy Now.Recession headwinds and macro fears have failed to stop the incredible growth of the internet retail sector in the past few months. According to a report by investment bank Morgan Stanley, global ecommerce sales remain on track to reach 27% of retail sales by 2026. The industry, per the bank, still has plenty of room for growth. This finding is backed by data models that predict the market size of the ecommerce industry could increase from $3.3 trillion in 2022 to $5.4 trillion in 2026, growing at a brisk compound annual growth rate. Some of the biggest beneficiaries of this boom in internet retail are likely to be Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). Elite investors, like hedge funds, already hold positions in these firms, despite recent share pullbacks due to a slowing economy. In the coming months, internet retail sales in sub-sectors like beauty, apparel, and grocery are likely to grow even further, leading to more brick-and-mortar store closures. Photo by CardMapr.nl on UnsplashOur MethodologyThe companies that operate in the internet retail sector were selected for the list. The analyst ratings of these firms and the latest updates related to them are also discussed to provide some additional context. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Internet Retail Stocks To Buy Now15.

The relatively new direct-to-consumer producer of healthcare apparel has declined along with the broader group of young, high-growth, publicly traded companies. Investors have continued to shun newer business models that they perceive to be riskier. The company has declined over 80% from its highs achieved in late 2021. The recent volatility created an opportunity for us to initiate and build a position in a company that we believe can continue to grow revenue above 20% annually while also expanding margins. Its superior product is competing against brands that lack investment capabilities to improve their offerings. We believe Figs could command a meaningful share of the $79 billion global healthcare apparel market and eventually develop products for other professions.”13. Chewy, Inc.

First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors were dominated by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”9. Etsy Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45    Etsy Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect buyers and sellers primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Australia, France, and India. On November 3, Deutsche Bank analyst Lee Horowitz maintained a Hold rating on Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) stock and raised the price target to $95 from $85, noting that the company posted better-than-expected sales and a meaningful beat on EBITDA and margins in the third quarter.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 45 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.2 billion in Etsy Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY), compared to 29 in the previous quarter worth $595.9 million.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Etsy Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY)  was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Stock selection in the consumer discretionary sector proved a tailwind to performance. Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), which operates several online marketplaces for craft and artisan goods, delivered second-quarter results that demonstrated the company’s pricing power, cash flow generation, and margin upside remain intact. While Etsy is experiencing declines in gross merchandise sales, it is seeing better-than-expected take rates and improved margins. We believe the company is well-positioned to grow advertising spending on its marketplace, bring in new buyers and strengthen its e-commerce advantages.”8. Sea Limited (NYSE:SE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55     Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) engages in digital entertainment, e-commerce, and digital financial service businesses in Southeast Asia, Latin America, the rest of Asia, and internationally. On November 16, Sea Limited shares jumped as much as 41% after the firm posted better than expected third-quarter financial results. The company said that it will renew its focus on profitability instead of outright growth in the coming months.On November 17, Morgan Stanley analyst Mark Goodridge maintained an Overweight rating on Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) stock and lowered the price target to $95 from $116, noting that the company’s third quarter reported a strong beat on cost and a clear pathway to profitability for Shopee.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 55 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.4 billion in Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), compared to 65 in the previous quarter worth $2.7 billion.In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), a global digital gaming and e-commerce company, detracted from performance for the period held. Similar to other online consumer businesses, Sea faced significant multiple compression in the quarter, exacerbated by a slowdown in user growth at its key Free Fire digital game and mounting investments in its e-commerce operation, particularly in new markets like Brazil. We exited our position as we lost confidence in the long-term unit economics in some of Sea’s new markets and were concerned by the simultaneous slowdown in revenue growth and increase in underlying cash burn.”7. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62      Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is a commerce company that provides a commerce platform and services worldwide. On November 16, PayPal, a payments company, said that it had launched Return Shopping, providing a new revenue stream for Shopify merchants by driving consumers to the merchant’s e-commerce storefronts within the return process. On November 15, Moffett Nathanson analyst Michael Morton initiated coverage of Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) stock with a Market Perform rating and $30 price target, noting that it is expected that the e-commerce sector will continue to grow at a historical pace and its peak is yet to come.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, St. Petersburg, Florida-based investment firm ARK Investment Management is a leading shareholder in Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) with 14.5 million shares worth more than $391.5 million.  In its Q3 2023 investor letter, Artisan Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is a leading e-commerce platform supporting over 2 million merchants with software, online storefronts and payments technology. Like Uber, Shopify returned to the mid-cap territory during Q2 as the company’s profit cycle and share price faced significant pressure. Earlier this year, the company began a phase of investments to support a range of future growth drivers, including Shopify Plus for larger brands, logistics services, international expansion, point-of-sale payments and social media-based commerce. With high inflation putting pressure on consumer spending, and with e-commerce activity normalizing after a massive pandemic spike, Shopify’s earnings have fallen sharply. While we have outstanding questions about the likelihood of success for the company’s capital-intensive logistics investments, we decided to take advantage of the stock’s &gt;75% YTD decline and initiate a GardenSM position at a deep discount to our PMV estimate. Our thesis is predicated on our belief there is still a long runway for commerce to move online, and Shopify is well-positioned to win a share of this market. The company has created an ecosystem of products (payment processing, financing, shipping, customer engagement tools, etc.), partners (TikTok, Google, Meta), sales channels and over 6,000 apps to help its merchants sell online and establish direct relationships with customers.”6. JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67  JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) provides supply chain-based technologies and services in the People’s Republic of China. On November 22, JD.com stated that it cut salaries for about 2,000 managers by 10% to 20% and diverted some of those savings toward a $1.4 billion employee benefits fund. On November 21, Barclays analyst Jiong Shao maintained an Overweight rating on JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) stock and raised the price target to $72 from $59, noting that the firm’s total revenue showed double-digit year-over-year growth and the operating margins tripled year-over-year against one of the worst economic backdrops in recent memory.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 67 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $3.7 billion in JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), compared to 62 in the preceding quarter worth $5.5 billion.In addition to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) is one of the top internet retail stocks to buy according to elite investors. In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Argosy Investors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We sold JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) as a result of the furor over Chinese stocks during the quarter. We had been concerned about China’s lack of respect for investor rights for some time, and Beijing has become significantly more aggressive in asserting itself of late. In addition, the legal structure Chinese companies use to come public in the U.S., a Cayman Islands shell corporation leaves American investors with an unsure path to recovering value should these companies cease to trade on U.S. exchanges. Because of the uncertainty, we exited our position in JD completely. We still love JD’s long-term prospects, but we cannot estimate the legal/regulatory risk associated with these companies anymore. More broadly, we are freeing up cash for some other positions we already own which have declined in this market, and after additional review, remain attractive.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Internet Retail Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested Articles:25 Countries with Highest Life Expectancy23 Countries with Highest Quality of Life in 202213 Best Biotech Penny Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

These efforts have now turned out to be a boon for the company during this peak shopping season.This is evident from the robust number of transactions that the company witnessed with Afterpay on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.Notably, Block experienced more than 61 million transactions across cities, including New York, Brooklyn, London, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Toronto.More precisely, Afterpay’s BNPL transactions were up 120% compared to pre-holiday online and in-person transactions.Block, Inc. Price and ConsensusBlock, Inc. Price and ConsensusBlock, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Block, Inc. QuoteSQ to BenefitAccording to a report from Square and Afterpay, BNPL is expected to be the most popular mode of transaction during this holiday season.Food and beverages, hardware, travel and experiences, automotive, and footwear are the item categories growing at a very fast pace on Afterpay. Further, beauty advent calendars, fluffy slides, perfume, sneakers and tracksuits are the most trending online products purchased with Afterpay.We believe the latest achievement, along with the growing momentum of Afterpay, is likely to contribute well to the transaction growth, gross payment volume (GPV) and top-line growth of the company during this holiday season.This in turn is likely to aid Block in gaining investors’ confidence in the near term. On a year-to-date basis, Square has lost 62% compared with the industry’s decline of 50%.In the third quarter of 2022, Afterpay generated $210 million in revenues, which were up 6% on a year-over-year basis.Growing InitiativesBlock’s growing efforts toward bolstering its presence in the booming BNPL market are noteworthy.Recently, Afterpay unveiled a new BNPL option — a monthly payment solution to deliver an enhanced payment experience to merchants and their customers. Notably, the new solution allows customers to break the total cost of their purchased items into monthly payments over a six- or 12-month period without any late fees.This apart, the company recently launched Square’s first integration with Afterpay in Canada, which was previously only available in the United States and Australia.In addition, the unveiling of Square’s integration with Clearpay (known as Afterpay outside of the U.K. and Europe) in the U.K. remains noteworthy.Afterpay’s partnership with Sephora, an omni-retailer of beauty products, in a bid to offer the BNPL service to the latter’s customers, is also a positive. Sephora shoppers in the United States enjoy the flexibility of payment in 4 installments for their purchases using the Afterpay app.Block plans to introduce Afterpay’s BNPL service to Sephora shoppers in Canada later this year.Afterpay partnered with trusted care retailer Rite Aid to offer the flexibility of paying for everyday items in four installments to the latter’s online customers.Afterpay teamed up with Hypebeast to offer the flexibility of payment in four installments to shoppers on the latter’s global e-commerce platform — HBX.With all the above-mentioned endeavors, Block, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), remains well-poised to capitalize on the growth prospects in the BNPL market.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.According to a Fortune Business Insights report, the global BNPL market is expected to hit $22.86 billion in 2022 and is likely to reach $90.51 billion by 2029, witnessing a CAGR of 21.7% between 2022 and 2029.Story continuesCompetitive ScenarioThe company’s robust BNPL efforts are expected to aid Block in strengthening its competitive position against players like PayPal PYPL, Affirm AFRM and VISA V, which are making strong efforts to bolster their presence in the rapidly growing BNPL market.More precisely, Block is likely to give cutthroat competition to PayPal, which is witnessing the solid adoption of its BNPL solution — Pay in 4. The company’s introduction of PayPal Pay Monthly, which allows customers to break the total costs of their purchased items into monthly payments over 6-24 months without any late fee, remains noteworthy.PayPal’s acquisition of Paidy, a Japan-based BNPL solution provider, remains noteworthy.Affirm is riding on its strategic partnerships. Its collaboration with Amazon to provide installment payment services to shoppers on the latter’s platform remains noteworthy. Affirm’s partnership with Shopify is another positive.Affirm expanded into Australia through a partnership with Peloton, strengthening its presence in the Asia Pacific region.Meanwhile, VISA provides a BNPL service called Visa Installments, including three installment models — Pre-Purchase, During Purchase and Post-Purchase — to help customers with flexible payments.VISA offers its BNPL solution in countries like the United States, Canada, Russia, Australia and Malaysia.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

What’s gotten less attention, however, is the failure of projects that attempted to use the underlying crypto ledger technology in private, corporate settings, the once-hyped ecosystem known collectively as enterprise blockchain.This week, TradeLens, a blockchain system built by software firm IBM and closely linked to shipping giant Maersk, announced it was shutting down, citing a lack of commercial traction. Some two weeks ago, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) said it was scrapping a much-delayed blockchain announced in 2016 that was meant to replace the clearing and settlement system that powers that equities market.Neither IBM nor ASX responded to requests for comment by press time.Back in the early days of 2015 to 2016, a groundswell of banks and large companies saw potential in taking blockchain technology – which, as originally designed for bitcoin and the rest of crypto, is a public platform open to basically anyone – into private, firewalled realms where groups of companies could use the tech to track assets and distribute an immutable record of their existence.The enterprise blockchain space, which doesn’t seem to experience the same bullish and bearish market cycles as public crypto, is now feeling a change in the broader economic climate, particularly in areas like shipping. This is one of the reasons TradeLens is closing shop, according to Lars Jensen, CEO of Vespucci Maritime, a consultancy firm to the container shipping industry.“The container shipping industry has had a run of two years of extreme profits, which allowed access to pursue all manner of technological solutions out there,” Jensen said in an interview. “Now, the tide has turned and industry is going to be under severe pressure. So that means for all the technological solutions out there, this is crunch time. Do you provide commercial value above and beyond what is just hopes and dreams for the future?”Story continuesSpeaking of TradeLens specifically, Jensen pointed out there is a lot of competition from a range of different track-and-trace solutions in the container shipping space.“TradeLens basically wanted to provide everything to everybody,” Jensen said. “But some of the other visibility providers out there are a lot more niche. They focus on either specific stakeholders or specific parts of the process, and they have a lot more commercial success. So this might also be an indication that the market might not have an appetite for a one-stop-shop solution that covers everything, but is more amenable to more specific and targeted solutions for specific problems.”Down underRichard G. Brown, chief technology officer of R3, the builder of the Corda enterprise blockchain and one of the first startups in the space, said that while the shuttering of TradeLens and the ASX blockchain has happened in quick succession, the reasons are very different.The ASX project’s failures have more to do with engagement between stakeholders and technology choices, said Brown, who referred to an Accenture report on the system.“When it comes to TradeLens, it’s not about a failure in the technology,” Brown said in an interview. “The demise of TradeLens may have something to do with IBM pulling back, or partly the cyclicality in the shipping industry, but the technology and the concept seem to be architecturally congruent from the outside.”Stepping back, Paul Brody, head of blockchain at global consultancy firm Ernst &amp; Young, believes the whole idea of private blockchains is fundamentally flawed. Brody and his team have been long-time adherents of promoting enterprise adoption of the public Ethereum blockchain, which has included using tech such as zero-knowledge proofs to make the tech palatable to big businesses.“All these private blockchain ventures have the same basic problem,” Brody told CoinDesk. “It’s a Web2 business model, but a little bit of Web3 pixie dust sprinkled on. And once the pixie dust kind of wears off, the value proposition doesn’t look so hot.”]"

SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is a global leader in enterprise software solutions and has been a major player in the software-as-a-service (SaaS) and cloud computing markets for years. The company has a strong presence in the enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) software markets and its solutions are used by businesses of all sizes around the world. The company has consistently reported strong financial results, with revenue and earnings growth in recent years driven by strong demand for its solutions and services. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) has also invested heavily in developing its cloud-based solutions and services. This has helped to drive growth and attract new customers. The company is also investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies, which it believes will be key to its future success.SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) holds a strong cash position and has free cash flows of EUR 3.87 billion.

ERP is a software category that is particularly critical to business functions, and, therefore, has high retention rates even in times of economic stress. For the past several years, SAP has been going through several transitions, including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters, we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed, and the result should be a faster-growing, more consistent, higher margin, and more advantaged business. As investment costs from these transition programs wane, and as the benefits of higher growth continue, we expect that earnings will grow at a double-digit rate from next year (2023) onwards. In light of this, we believe the valuation is very attractive for longterm investors.”In addition to SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), big-tech companies such as Alphabet Inc.

While we think process automation is a growing market, in a slowing macro environment single solutions may be more vulnerable than the platform solutions of software providers who can bundle products to meet a wide range of needs. In addition, the company has a material component of sales sourced in Europe where the economy is more vulnerable.”13.

Its shares fell because of softening demand from its small- and medium-sized customers, the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and a deceleration in its marketing related offerings. In addition, a well-communicated reduction in potential users for Veeva’s CRM platform, because of sales headcount reductions among certain life sciences customers, implied a possible deceleration in growth rates. Despite these challenges, we see increasing traction of its newer products among large pharmaceutical customers that we expect to generate significant profitable growth in the coming years.”11.

FIVN is well-positioned as contact centers transition to the cloud with high customer retention (120% last quarter), the doubling of its strategic sales team over the past year, and new partnerships, including with AT&amp;T, CDW and Microsoft. We believe the company can grow its top-line at more than 20% annually, improve its 60% gross margins, and expand EBITDA margin to more than 20%, all of which should lead to 30%+ EPS growth for the foreseeable future. The company should turn FCF-positive this year and continue to expand its FCF growth in the years to come given its highly capital efficient business model.”10.

Over the years, JIRA has become the industry standard for developer collaboration tools, which has driven Atlassian to benefit from durable growth, compounding revenues over 30% for nine consecutive years with free cash flows compounding at higher rates. Atlassian’s opportunity is underpinned by three large markets (DevOps, IT service management, and Work Management) with product leadership in each area, and a disruptive go-to-market model. Atlassian’s products are easy to use and are still primarily purchased online via a highly efficient self-service model, driving attractive unit economics with substantially lower-than-industry Sales and Marketing spend at approximately 15% of revenues (versus 30% to 40% for peers), enabling it to invest more in R&amp;D and powering disruptive pricing dynamics (where customers get similar or better functionality for a much lower price)Additionally, Atlassian began its business model shift to the cloud in earnest in fiscal year 2020 which has driven accelerating subscription growth of over 50% for the last five quarters (with only about 10 points of growth due to cloud migrations). The model transition is expected to mature in fiscal year 2024, which should unlock smoother long-term cross selling and up selling activity, opening an opportunity to drive up average customer spending by six to eight times over time. While seat expansion remains the most important revenue growth driver in the near term, the recently introduced Enterprise and Premium offerings, priced at a one and a half to three times compared to the standard package, are also starting to contribute, and are expected become even more prominent with the cloud transition…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

But you can significantly boost your returns by picking above-average stocks. For example, the International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) share price is up 25% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market decline of around 19% (not including dividends). That's a solid performance by our standards! However, the longer term returns haven't been so impressive, with the stock up just 11% in the last three years.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for International Business Machines To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over the last twelve months, International Business Machines actually shrank its EPS by 30%.This means it's unlikely the market is judging the company based on earnings growth. Therefore, it seems likely that investors are putting more weight on metrics other than EPS, at the moment.We haven't seen International Business Machines increase dividend payments yet, so the yield probably hasn't helped drive the share higher. It seems far more likely that the 42% boost to the revenue over the last year, is making the difference. Revenue growth often does precede earnings growth, so some investors might be willing to forgo profits today because they have their eyes fixed firmly on the future.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think International Business Machines will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).Story continuesWhat About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for International Business Machines the TSR over the last 1 year was 31%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that International Business Machines shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 31% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 5%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 5 warning signs  with International Business Machines (at least 1 which is significant)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

228,7abfb2ac-2647-3d4d-8857-87a48998376b,MPC,2022-12-01,Is Marathon Petroleum (MPC) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-petroleum-mpc-buy-wall-153903712.html,1669822743,STORY,['MPC'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Marathon Petroleum (MPC).Marathon Petroleum currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.54, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.54 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 69.2% and 7.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MPCBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MPCCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Marathon Petroleum here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Marathon Petroleum, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in MPC?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Marathon Petroleum, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 9.8% over the past month to $25.70.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Marathon Petroleum.

West said the company plans to expand to more cities in 2023.""You'll likely see us expand the number of markets in a large number next year,"" he said. Cruise believes it can accelerate application of its technology to other cities using a ""repeatable playbook"" developed in San Francisco, Austin and Phoenix. That should start to deliver revenue numbers with more zeros in them, he said.The planned launch of the Origin, designed as a purpose-built automated vehicle, ""is a huge unlock"" for Cruise because of its lower cost, West said.Cruise is currently testing human-operated Origins in San Francisco. Volume production is expected to start in 2023. Up to now, Cruise has operated its limited service in San Francisco with a small fleet of Chevrolet Bolt EVs.Cruise is also working to expand delivery services - a prototype of an Origin outfitted with lockers for goods is on the company's website. Walmart is an investor, and is currently testing Cruise delivery at eight stores in Phoenix. Delivery has ""the potential to be a big part of the business,"" West said.Wall Street will be watching Cruise closely in 2023.The decision by Ford and Volkswagen to pull the plug on their jointly-controlled automated vehicle operation, Argo AI, threw the entire automated vehicle sector into a tailspin. Investors have hammered the shares of public AV tech companies and driven a wave of consolidation deals.Ford and VW said they saw no near-term profit in robotaxis. GM CEO Mary Barra is taking the opposite bet. She told analysts earlier this month to expect GM to keep spending $500 million a quarter, $2 billion a year on Cruise's expansion.Story continuesGM has said the operation can generate revenue of $50 billion a year by 2030. The shakeout in the AV sector has cleared the field for Cruise to grow. But Cruise faces competition from rival Waymo, which is already operating in Phoenix. Waymo is driving to expand its robotaxi and delivery businesses into Cruise's backyard in San Francisco and other markets Cruise could have in its sights.Cruise must also compete with ride-hailing platforms Uber and Lyft. They have to contend with the costs of human drivers. Both companies have made efforts to automate ride services. Uber and Lyft already have millions of customers signed up. They also have experience dealing with local regulators who do not always welcome more competition for public transit or licensed cabs.(Reporting by Joe White; Editing by Alexandra Hudson)]"

232,6e3bb475-0afe-3401-a669-ceb52298f095,GM,2022-12-01,Here is What to Know Beyond Why General Motors Company (GM) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-general-motors-140002735.html,1669816802,STORY,['GM'],"[General Motors Company (GM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors Company falls in, has lost 16.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.6%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.95 points to a change of -1.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.16 indicates a change of -11.4% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, General Motors Company is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate of $41.54 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +23.7%. The $154.76 billion and $160.02 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +21.9% and +3.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $41.89 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.4%. EPS of $2.25 for the same period compares with $1.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.83 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.13%. The EPS surprise was +19.05%.Over the last four quarters, General Motors Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Registrations in all the major EU markets fell, with Spain witnessing the sharpest decline of 21%. Sales in France, Germany and Italy fell 19.1%, 15.4% and 10.4%, respectively, year over year.On the news front, electric vehicle (EV) king Tesla TSLA and Ford F grabbed attention as they issued massive recalls. While Fordwill recall 634,000 SUVs over malfunctioning fuel injectors, Tesla is recalling more than 80,000 cars in China over software and seatbelt issues.Meanwhile, as legacy automakers are ramping up their electrification strides, General Motors GM and Mazda Motor Corporation MZDAY made headlines. Last week, General Motors outlined its plans and shared its progress toward the global vision of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion at the GM China Tech Day 2022 in Shanghai. With stringent environmental regulations and changing customer preferences creating a demand wave for battery-powered cars, Mazda pledged close to $11 billion to electrify its portfolio.BYD Co.

BYDDY currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.Story continuesLast Week’s Top StoriesFord issued a recall of more than 634,000 SUVs worldwide on the grounds of a cracked fuel injector that can cause fuel spillage or vapor leakage onto a hot engine leading to fires. The recall covers Bronco Sport and Escape SUVs from 2020 through 2023 model years equipped with three 1.5-liter cylinder engines.Ford received 20 incidents of fires, including three that ignited nearby structures. The company also stated that it has four reports of fires that were caused less than five minutes after the engines were turned off. Apart from these, the automaker has four injury claims not concerning burns and 43 legal claims attributed to the problem.Ford is yet to come up with repairs, and once they are made available, owners will need to schedule service with a preferred dealer. Owners will be notified by letters starting Dec 19.General Motors announced the plan to roll out more than 15 Ultium-based models in China by 2025. It also emphasized its focus on developing more connected and intelligent electric vehicles. The company is expediting the introduction of Ultium-empowered EVs in China to move toward an all-electric future.The all-electric Cadillac Lyriq SUV started customer deliveries in September. Following that, a wide range of Ultium-based models across brands, segments and body styles was prepared for rollout in China. The Cadillac Celestiq showcased will be the first product brought in by the Durant Guild, GM’s new lifestyle platform. Also, the first Ultium-based Buick model will be launched in China later this year.The Chevrolet FNR-XE concept made its debut on Tech Day 2022.

It forecasts EVs to account for 25-40% of its total sales by the beginning of the next decade. Its previous EV sales estimate was roughly 25% of sales by 2030.As part of a three-phase plan, MZDAY would introduce battery-EV models in the second half of phase 2, which is sometime between 2025 and 2027. It intends to do a full-scale launch of all-electric vehicles between 2028 and 2030. The company has targeted about 4.5 trillion yen in net sales for the business year ending March 2026. This marks a significant jump of about 45% from the financial year ending March 2022. Mazda’s collaboration with its main suppliers, such as Hiroshima Aluminum Industry, Imasen Electric, Ondo Corporation and HIROTEC Corporation, augurs well for the long-term growth of the company as well as the industry. Mazda’s efforts in procuring and securing batteries to expedite its electrification initiatives are noteworthy.BYD announced that it has inked another deal with public transport operator Nobina to supply 64 of its electric buses. The vehicles are scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of 2023 and will be put into operation in southwestern Norway. The operator has been relying on e-buses from the China-based manufacturer for some time and is growing the fleet. The recent order includes 40 units of 12-meter electric buses 24 units of 15-meter e-buses.Both vehicle models are equipped with electric heating management systems.

The global leader in flavor announced a dividend hike. It will now pay a quarterly dividend of 39 cents per share, up from the prior rate of 37 cents. The hiked dividend will be paid out on Jan 9, 2023, to shareholders of record as of Dec 30, 2022. This marks the company’s 37th consecutive year of a quarterly dividend hike.McCormick currently has a dividend payout of 56%, a dividend yield of 1.8% and a free cash flow yield of 3.8%. With an annual free cash flow return on investment of 5.3%, the increased dividend is likely to be sustainable. During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, McCormick returned $298 million in cash to shareholders through dividends. Dividend payouts are one of the biggest enticements for investors and McCormick is committed to spurring shareholders’ value.What Else Should You Know?The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has strategically increased its presence through acquisitions, which have been strengthening its portfolio. In December 2020, McCormick bought a 100% stake in FONA International, LLC and some of its affiliates. FONA’s diverse portfolio helps McCormick bolster its value-add offerings and expand the flavor solutions segment into attractive categories. In November 2020, McCormick completed the acquisition of the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce — a premium Mexico-based hot sauce brand. The buyout of Cholula accelerates McCormick’s growth potential across the condiment platform and widens the product portfolio in the hot sauce category.The company is on track to make investments to expand its infrastructure worldwide. In this regard, McCormick is investing in its supply chain to enhance capacity and capabilities. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that it is investing in additional Flavor Solutions seasoning capacity, which is likely to come online at the beginning of 2023.The company is expanding FONA's footprint to aid flavor growth. Recently, management opened its new U.K. Peterborough Flavor Solutions production unit to support solid growth momentum with quick-service restaurants.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcCormick focuses on saving costs and enhancing productivity through the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (“CCI”) program. Started in 2009, the CCI program helped the company reduce costs and improve productivity. It has used CCI savings to increase investments, leading to higher sales and profits. Management expects to achieve CCI-led cost savings of $85 million in 2022.Wrapping UpMcCormick has been grappling with cost inflation for a while now. During third-quarter fiscal 2022, the company’s gross profit margin contracted 320 basis points (bps) to 35.5%, thanks to escalated cost inflation and other supply chain expenses. McCormick is bearing the brunt of supply chain bottlenecks as the recovery of some constrained materials is taking longer than anticipated. All said, the aforementioned cost-saving efforts and expansion efforts are likely to aid growth.MKC’s stock has dropped 0.4% in the past three months against the industry’s growth of 4.8%.3 Solid Staple PicksSome top-ranked stocks are The Chef's Warehouse CHEF, General Mills GIS and Conagra Brands CAG.The Chef's Warehouse, which distributes specialty food products, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

(NYSE:PNC) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/84-ownership-pnc-financial-services-140024177.html,1669816824,STORY,['PNC'],"[A look at the shareholders of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 84% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of PNC Financial Services Group, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PNC Financial Services Group?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.PNC Financial Services Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at PNC Financial Services Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. PNC Financial Services Group is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.3% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.6% and 7.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 16 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of PNC Financial Services GroupWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$225m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over PNC Financial Services Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand PNC Financial Services Group better, we need to consider many other factors.

(ISRG): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-intuitive-surgical-140002147.html,1669816802.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +4.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, which Intuitive Surgical, Inc. falls in, has gained 6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.26 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.71 points to a change of -5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.34 indicates a change of +13.5% from what Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ISRG _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $1.68 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8.1%. The $6.24 billion and $6.97 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.3% and +11.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIntuitive Surgical, Inc. reported revenues of $1.56 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11%. EPS of $1.19 for the same period compares with $1.19 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.52 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.17%. The EPS surprise was +8.18%.Over the last four quarters, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intuitive Surgical, Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

UNP, Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. CP, CSX Corp. CSX and Norfolk Southern Corp. NSC.Industry: RailroadLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2022908/4-railroad-stocks-to-capitalize-on-strong-freight-demandThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry is being aided by a steady improvement in freight demand, thanks to the buoyant U.S. economy, which is driving growth for the railroads. Despite this tailwind, the industry is being plagued by escalating fuel prices and supply-chain disruptions.Companies like Union Pacific Corp., Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd., CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. are expected to thrive on upbeat freight demand.About the IndustryThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry consists of railroad operators transporting freight (such as agricultural products, industrial products, coal, intermodal, automotive, consumer products, metals and minerals), primarily across North America. These companies focus on providing logistics and supply-chain expertise services.While freight constitutes a significant chunk of revenues, some of these companies also derive a small portion of their top line from other rail-related services, including third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, routine land sales and container sales, among others. A few companies offer service to multiple production and distribution facilities. Besides owning locomotives, some of these companies have equipment of leased locomotives, railcars etc.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Railroad IndustryHealthy Freight Demand: Freight demand continues to be strong in 2022 as pandemic fears fade, despite softening from the 2021 levels due to a shift in consumer spending from goods to services. The Cass Freight Index rose 2.9% on a year-over-year basis in October. With steady freight demand, railroads are benefiting from higher volumes and pricing gains. The upbeat freight environment is expected to continue in the near term.Story continuesDividend Hikes Signal Financial Strength: With the resumption of economic activities, many players, including some railroad companies are reactivating their shareholder-friendly measures like paying out dividends, which underline their solid financial footing and confidence in the business. Earlier in 2022, both UNP &amp; CSX upped its dividend 10% and 7.5% to $1.30 per share and 10 cents per share, respectively.Supply-Chain Disruptions a Woe: Persistent supply-chain disruptions, including labor and equipment shortages, are hurting railroad volumes in some segments, especially the carload and intermodal unit. Per The Association of American Railroads' latest rail traffic data, the total U.S. carload and intermodal units declined 0.5% year over year in October 2022. Supply-chain disruptions are likely to persist for a while now, thus denting carload and intermodal volumes.High Fuel Costs Hurt Bottom Line: Operating expenses are on the rise, mainly due to increased fuel costs. Fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player. High oil price (up 5.7% in the first nine months of 2022) is augmenting fuel costs. Even though oil price declined from its multi-year highs due to recession fears, it remains elevated.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Railroad industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #93. This rank places it in the top 37% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, implies encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry's position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimate has been revised 1.1% upward since June-end.Given the bullish near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few noteworthy stocks that you may want to hold in your portfolio. But it's worth looking at the industry's shareholder returns and its current valuation first.Industry's Price PerformanceOver the past year, the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry has declined 6.1% compared with the S&amp;P 500 composite's fall of 15.1% and the broader sector's decrease of 12%.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), a commonly used multiple for valuing railroad stocks, the industry is currently trading at 7.41X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 5.61X. It is also above the sector's P/B ratio of 4.27X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 10.86X, as low as 5.69X and at the median of 8.08X.4 Railroad Stocks to Keep Tabs OnEach of the stocks mentioned below currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Union Pacific: Based in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific provides rail transportation services across the United States.With economic activities gaining pace, freight revenues, accounting for the bulk of UNP's top line, are improving. In the first nine months of 2022, freight revenues improved 16% year over year. Segmentwise, freight revenues in the first nine months of 2022 increased 16%, 14% and 19% in the bulk, industrial and premium units, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNP's 2022 earnings is pegged at 15.8% growth from the 2021 reported number.Canadian Pacific: Headquartered in Calgary, Canada, Canadian Pacific operates a transcontinental railway network in Canada and the United States.With the gradual recovery in freight-market conditions, freight revenues, contributing considerably to the top line, increased 4% in 2021. In third-quarter 2022, freight revenues increased 19% despite headwinds like supply-chain woes remaining.The increase was owing to higher freight revenues at key sub-groups like intermodal where freight revenues surged 44%. Revenues at the Fertilizers and sulphur sub-segment were up 11% year over year.In the September quarter, total freight revenues per revenue ton-miles (RTMs) rose 11% year over year. Total freight revenues per carload rose 7% from the year-ago quarter's reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CP's 2022 revenues is pegged at 1.8% growth from the 2021 actuals.CSX: Based in Jacksonville, FL, CSX offers rail-based freight transportation services like traditional rail service, and transport of intermodal containers and trailers besides rail-to-truck transfers.CSX's top line is benefiting from higher export coal volumes, solid domestic intermodal shipments, volume growth in other segments and pricing gains. Evidently, coal revenues increased 36% in the first nine months of 2022, driven by strength in export coal. Intermodal revenues increased 19% in the first nine months of 2022, led by strong demand, mainly on the domestic front. Demand is likely to remain strong going forward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CSX's 2022 revenues stands at 22.4% growth from the year-ago reported figure.Norfolk Southern: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, Norfolk Southern is a major freight railroad company, primarily engaged in transporting raw material, intermediate products and finished goods.A strong demand scenario prompted management to increase its current-year revenue growth outlook. Total revenues are now expected to increase above 13% in 2022 from the 2021 levels (earlier outlook: growth in excess of 12%). The intermodal and merchandise segments are expected to be the main drivers.Near-term opportunities are present in the coal segment too. Driven by revenue growth, reported the operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is expected to be roughly 62% in 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NSC's 2022 earnings stands at 13.6% growth from the year-ago reading.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Chico's FAS, Inc. CHS, Burberry Group plc BURBY, Hibbett, Inc. HIBB, Vivint Smart Home, Inc. VVNT and Ross Stores, Inc. ROST.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Picks to Benefit from a Strong Holiday Shopping SeasonThe first taste of holiday sales was experienced this past weekend, as buyers finally opened their wallets. Unlike last year, when retailers were able to woo consumers as early as October by bringing forward their discounts and promos, this year buyers held out.One big reason for this was inventory. Last year, people feared they wouldn't get what they were looking for, so they started shopping early. And this year, people know that there's sufficient and in fact excess inventory. So they expected steeper discounts if they waited longer. And that's what has played out.The still-very-high inflation (7.7% in October), which has sapped some purchasing power, and the news flow around job cuts (as well as the Fed's intention to inflict more ""pain"") have also made buyers more cautious. Availability of funds is a big issue unlike last holiday season, when a strong stock market, free money and limited spending options allowed people to build their bank balances. This year, buyers have leaned on the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) option. They are also dipping into savings and using credit cards.Given the above, it's pretty encouraging that Thanksgiving Day sales were up 2.9% and Black Friday sales up 2.3% from last year (Adobe estimates). Online sales were up 221%. Toys and exercise equipment were the hottest categories, growing 285% and 218%, respectively. Other popular items were gaming consoles, drones and Apple MacBooks. BNPL payments jumped 78% from the prior week.Story continuesOverall, Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday is expected to bring in a big haul of $35.12 billion to retailers ($5.29 billion on Thanksgiving Day, $9.12 billion on Black Friday, $4.52 billion on Saturday, $4.99 billion on Sunday and a record $11.2 billion on Cyber Monday). Updated figures will be available later today.The National Retail Federation expects holiday sales to increase around 8% this year. Given the rate of inflation, this means flattish sales, which is not at all bad, all things considered.Therefore, this could be a good time to buy some retail stocks. Here are a few that are worth considering-Chico's FAS, Inc.hico's an omnichannel specialty retailer of women's private branded casual-to-dressy clothing, intimate wear and complementary accessories.The shares have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating and an A for Value, Growth and Momentum, indicating their suitability for every kind of investor.In the fiscal year ended January 2023, the company is expected to generate revenue and earnings growth of 19.6% and 127.5%, respectively. The following year, revenue and earnings are expected to grow a respective 5.0% and 9.9%. Analyst estimates are also moving up: in the last seven days, 2023 estimates are up 6 cents (7.1%) and 2024 estimates up 5 cents (5.3%).Burberry Group plcBurberry is a London-based manufacturer, retailer and wholesaler of luxury goods such as womenswear, menswear, childrenswear, beauty, eyewear, shoes and accessories, as well as leather goods-like bags.The shares carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as well as Value, Growth and Momentum Scores of B, A and C, respectively.The company's revenue and earnings for the fiscal year ending in March 2023 are expected to grow 22.7% and 14.8%, respectively. Growth rates are expected to moderate to a respective 6.7% and 8.5% the following year. But given that estimates continue to rise; they're up 7 cents (5%) for this year's earnings and up 8 cents (5.3%) for next year's earnings, current estimates could prove to be conservative. Hibbett, Inc.Being a retailer of athletic-inspired fashion products for small and mid-sized communities in the United States, Hibbett stores offer a range of merchandise, including athletic footwear, athletic and fashion apparel, team sports equipment and related accessories.The shares carry a Zacks Rank #2 with Value, Growth and Momentum scores of A, F and B, respectively.The double- and triple-digit estimated growth in the third and fourth quarters, respectively, is not likely to offset the weakness in the first half of the fiscal year ending January 2023. But analysts are optimistic about the following year, in which growth rates are currently estimated to be 6.8% for revenue and 8.2% for earnings.Even these numbers could prove to be conservative if the estimate revision trend picks up pace. In the last 7 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is up 7 cents to $10.60. Current estimates are baking in a good amount of conservatism, which is justified give the fears of a recession.Vivint Smart Home, Inc.As its name implies, Vivint Smart Home sells, installs and services a range of smart home and security systems, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Its smart home platform includes cloud-enabled smart home operating systems; AI-driven smart home automation and assistance software; software-enabled smart home devices; and tech-enabled services to educate, manage, and support the smart home. It also sells control panels, door and window sensors, security cameras and smoke alarms, door locks, motion sensors, glass break detectors, key fobs, emergency pendants, carbon monoxide detectors, as well as fire, flood and burglary sensors.The Zacks Rank #2 company has an A for Value, Growth and Momentum and analyst estimates indicate why.Analysts currently expect the company to grow revenue by 12.6% this year and 7.4% in the next. Losses are expected to be cut by 70.2% and 19.6%, respectively. Loss expectations for Vivint have been roughly halved in the last 90 days for both the December and March quarters and for fiscal 2023.Ross Stores, Inc.Ross Stores, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, operates off-price retail apparel and home fashion stores under the Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS brand names. Its stores primarily offer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions. The company's Ross Dress for Less stores sell its products at department and specialty stores primarily to middle income households; and dd's DISCOUNTS stores sell its products at department and discount stores for households with moderate income.The Zacks Rank #1 stock has Value, Growth and Momentum Scores of D, F and A, respectively.Its revenue and earnings are expected to decline 2.0% and 11.7% in the fiscal year ending January 2023. Things are already looking up however, going by the estimates for the current and next quarter, which represent increases of 18.3% and 22.7%, respectively. For the year ending January 2024, revenue and earnings are expected to grow a respective 6.1% and 14.3%. In the last 30 days, 2023 estimates are up 27 cents (6.8%) and 2024 estimates are up 30 cents (6.5%).Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

247,44743941-0721-3be5-abde-29fb02f64e93,ADI,2022-12-01,"Analog Devices, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ADI) Financials Are Too Obscure To Link With Current Share Price Momentum: What's In Store For the Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analog-devices-inc-nasdaq-adi-110051154.html,1669892451,STORY,['ADI'],"[Analog Devices' (NASDAQ:ADI) stock is up by a considerable 21% over the past month. However, we decided to pay attention to the company's fundamentals which don't appear to give a clear sign about the company's financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Analog Devices'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Analog Devices is:7.5% = US$2.7b ÷ US$36b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.08 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Analog Devices' Earnings Growth And 7.5% ROEWhen you first look at it, Analog Devices' ROE doesn't look that attractive. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 19%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. However, the moderate 12% net income growth seen by Analog Devices over the past five years is definitely a positive. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Analog Devices' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 27% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for ADI? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Analog Devices Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?The high three-year median payout ratio of 75% (or a retention ratio of 25%) for Analog Devices suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Besides, Analog Devices has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 41% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 16% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.SummaryIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Analog Devices' performance. Although the company has shown a fair bit of growth in earnings, the reinvestment rate is low. Meaning, the earnings growth number could have been significantly higher had the company been retaining more of its profits and reinvesting that at a higher rate of return.

More like a penny for hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Indeed, parents may want to be extra careful next time they empty out their kids’ piggy banks. They might just be holding a fortune in the form of what appears to be a mere cent. This isn’t news among seasoned collectors. A quick search on eBay for collectible pennies turns up more than 1,900 results as of Wednesday, Nov. 30.See: Have Any $200 Quarters Lying Around? It’s Worth Checking Your Spare ChangeExplore: If Your Credit Score Is Under 740, Make These 4 Moves NowWhat makes a penny worth more than its face value comes down to a few factors, including rarity, errors, the year it was manufactured and materials used. For instance, an all-copper penny is worth more than a regular penny, which is made of zinc coated with copper.What should consumers know about pennies, and what makes them unique enough to be worth far more than a single cent? Here’s a look at six of the most expensive pennies out there and how much they go for, according to Gainesville Coins, along with a detailed description of what they look like should one be so lucky as to find one in their jar of spare change or beneath their couch covers.The 1931-S Lincoln CentSome 866,000 examples of the 1931-S Lincoln Cent were minted during the height of the Great Depression, and they’re worth $65 to $100+ a pop. These pennies are a deep copper color with a bold orange hue shining through. They tout a profile of Abraham Lincoln on the head side and two leaves on the tail side that wrap around the words “One Cent” in all caps. Aside from the year, 1931, this penny doesn’t look all that different from newer coins.The 1909-S Indian CentWorth between $300 and $1,000+, the 1909-S Indian cent is a brassy dull color bordering on smoky silver chrome. It features the profile of a head in a headdress on one side. On the flip side there’s a garland-decked wreath wrapping around the words “One Cent” in all caps, beneath a crest.Story continuesThe 1909-S VDB Lincoln CentThe 1909-S VDB Lincoln Cent goes for $600 to $1,300+ and is famous among coin collectors who will instantly recognize the “VDB” lettering on the coin, which refers to the coin designer Victor David Brenner. His initials were removed the following year due to a storm of controversy. These coins, of which only 484,000 were made, look like standard Lincoln wheat pennies of their time, save for those sly and oh so small “VDB” initials.The 1955 Doubled Die Lincoln CentMany coin collectors out there deem the 1955 doubled-die Lincoln cent, worth between $1,000 and $2,000+, the “Holy Grail” error coin. The error is plain to notice even for the untrained eye, so long as one looks closely. The print looks doubled or blurred on the head side.The 1944 Steel Lincoln CentNow we’re getting into some very serious money. The 1944 steel Lincoln cent goes for between $75,000 and upwards of $125,000. These pennies are easy to spot because they are made of steel and have a strong silvery hue. The 1944 and 1943 steel pennies are about equal in terms of rarity.Take Our Poll: Do You Think People Should Invest In Crypto?How To Make Money Fast: 24 Proven WaysThe 1943 Bronze Lincoln CentBe on the lookout for the1943 bronze Lincoln cent. It’s worth more than $125,000. This coin is special because no one knows exactly how many exist, although they likely number around 24. These bronze pennies are tricky to spot because at first they look just like an old rusty penny from the 1940s — nothing too rare. But look closely and you’ll notice the yellowish-brown sparkle and bluish luminescence that distinguish bronze from copper.More From GOBankingRates6 Shakeups to Social Security Expected in the New YearGet Top Holiday Shopping and Savings TipsThe 10 Best Rewards Credit Cards for 20237 Ways To Know You're Ready To Start InvestingThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Keep a Penny Jar?

Armed with temporary government permits, they started exploiting it earlier this year.There's just one problem - the seam is within the site of Southern Copper Corp's planned $2.6 billion Los Chancas mine. One of the world's biggest copper miners, it also has a permit to dig in the same area.Grupo Mexico's Southern Copper aims to start producing here in 2027 after decades of studies. The planned mine is crucial to the company's goal of producing 1.8 million tonnes of copper annually by 2030.But the rise of artisanal copper mining - driven by high global metal prices and sustained by a messy government permitting system - is threatening billions in new investments by Southern Copper and others in Peru, according to Reuters reviews of internal company reports, interviews with executives and a visit to Tapairihua to meet the miners.Small-scale copper miners are now challenging Big Copper for territorial control of rich deposits of the red metal. Artisanal copper mining is creating much-needed income for impoverished Andean Peruvians even as it brings them into conflict with major miners, a rare and previously unreported trend in the world's No. 2 copper producer.""This used to happen with silver and gold, but now it's affecting copper,"" said Raul Jacob, Southern Copper's chief financial officer, bemoaning what the company sees as the government's poor handling of artisanal mining permits.In Peru, artisanal mining permits have doubled to 80,000 since 2020, government records show. And copper is the new focus.Southern Copper is not the only mining company in a stand-off with the miners. Chinese-owned MMG Ltd's nearby Las Bambas copper mine is struggling to develop two new open pits because of artisanal miners who have settled on the same land. The company says its current pit is running out.Story continues""Informal mining is entering lands granted to formal (mining) companies and threatening the development of large-scale projects,"" a source close to MMG told Reuters.While companies often call small-scale miners ""informal"" or ""illegal,"" what complicates the matter are two dueling authorizations - one for artisanal mining and another to hold the mining rights to a given area. Mining companies own the latter, known as concessions.But since 2012 Peru has been granting artisanal mining permits on lands that overlap with concessions, giving the small-scale miners some legal protection, Reuters found after checking the geolocations of the permits and reviewing an internal document in which Peru's mining ministry did the same.POTENTIAL FOR MORE DISPUTESDisputes between mining firms and artisanal miners may only increase over time. Peru's leftist administration presented a new framework for artisanal mining last week that declared artisanal mining is ""as important"" as big mining.Southern Copper has asked the government to revoke all artisanal mining permits on its concession. About half have now been canceled, causing resentment in Tapairihua.""We are going to defend ourselves. At the end of the day we are at home, and from home there is nowhere to go,"" Retamozo, a mining engineer and president of the Tapairihua Mining Association, told Reuters.While artisanal permits have existed since 2012, lower copper prices that decade meant they were not in demand. But copper has risen more than 60% since 2020 due to demand for electric vehicles.The surge in artisanal copper mining is forcing the government to review its artisanal permitting system, a mechanism that was meant to be a temporary bridge toward formalization and intended mostly for gold miners.""Our country is a mining country but we haven't had until now a mining framework that gives a long-term view about small-scale mining,"" Alberto Rojas, Peru's top mining formalization official, told ReutersRojas, however, suggested artisanal miners would lose in a dispute against concession holders.""Where we have concessions we can't have (artisanal mining permits),"" Rojas said. ""We can't disavow the concessions that have already been granted.""DIGGERS, TRUCKSOn a recent day in Tapairihua, Reuters visited the artisanal mining operations, where dozens of wood and blue tarpaulin homes were erected, and tunnels supported with wooden beams burrowed into the steep rocky hillside.In Peru's Andes many feel the copper under the ground is a right, with mining dating back to the Incas and other cultures that existed before Spain's colonization. Tapairihua looks down onto the river Antabamba, meaning ""copper plain"" in the Andean Quechua language.Many of the miners are also local subsistence farmers who took up mining in search of income. Many declined to be named because they have been sued by Southern Copper over their mining activities.To extract copper, they use dynamite to explode rock that they bring out in wheelbarrows and bags. Miners earn 80 soles ($20.61) a day, extracting enough rock to fill a handful of trucks a week, usually containing around 5% copper, though this level can rise as high as 18%.Gherson Quintanilla arrived in Tapairihua earlier this year with a background in artisanal gold mining. He came because he heard copper was abundant and expertise was low.""My goal is to extract up to two truckloads a day,"" he told Reuters.But artisanal copper mining is not always as small scale.Graphic: Las Bambas: Small-scale miners https://www.reuters.com/graphics/PERU-MINING/zjpqjkdbyvx/chart.pngAn internal Las Bambas presentation seen by Reuters estimated informal miners were blasting some 1,950 tonnes of rock per day, almost double their output a year ago.The report said artisanal miners were using heavy machinery and diggers as well as pneumatic tools.Overall, it estimated the government has issued 700 permits that overlap with Las Bambas's concession,But removing those miners is not straightforward. While Las Bambas and Southern Copper hold mining rights - which grants them access to the mineral underground - in most cases they have yet to buy the property rights to the surface terrain.That limits their options because they cannot file an eviction claim on land they do not own.The source close to Las Bambas said MMG recognized this difficulty and anticipated it would have to buy out the miners if it wants them to leave the site of its third pit, set to open in 2027 - if there are no delays.At the site of its second pit, which was supposed to open this year, Las Bambas has filed eviction claims against the miners there because it already owns that particular parcel of land. The company estimates almost a dozen mining sites in the area. Reuters was unable to determine the number of miners working in them.Graphic: Las Bambas: artisanal mining https://www.reuters.com/graphics/PERU-MINING/lbvggnmarvq/chart.png'FUEL TO THE FIRE'In May, Southern Copper sued Retamozo and other Tapairihua miners, saying their mining permits were non-compliant.Weeks later a fire destroyed Southern Copper's local headquarters, which is made up of tents, just minutes downhill from where the small-scale miners are operating. Burned-out cars remain there today.Nobody was hurt in the fire and no arrests have been made. Peruvian authorities say the matter remains under investigation.The miners have distanced themselves from the arson, though Retamozo acknowledged the lawsuits have angered them and that some individual members may have acted out of ""resentment.""The number of valid artisanal mining permits in Tapairihua has fallen from 100 to 32 since May, according to government records. An internal mining ministry document seen by Reuters shows that the process is under way to revoke the remaining permits.Retamozo cautioned about what would happen if those were canceled.""Canceling them would add fuel to the fire,"" he said.($1 = 3.8811 soles)(Reporting by Marco Aquino and Marcelo Rochabrun; Editing by Adam Jourdan and Ross Colvin)]"

Chinese-owned MMG Ltd's nearby Las Bambas copper mine is struggling to develop two new open pits because of artisanal miners who have settled on the same land. The company says its current pit is running out.Story continues""Informal mining is entering lands granted to formal (mining) companies and threatening the development of large-scale projects,"" a source close to MMG told Reuters.While companies often call small-scale miners ""informal"" or ""illegal,"" what complicates the matter are two dueling authorizations - one for artisanal mining and another to hold the mining rights to a given area. Mining companies own the latter, known as concessions.But since 2012 Peru has been granting artisanal mining permits on lands that overlap with concessions, giving the small-scale miners some legal protection, Reuters found after checking the geolocations of the permits and reviewing an internal document in which Peru's mining ministry did the same.POTENTIAL FOR MORE DISPUTESDisputes between mining firms and artisanal miners may only increase over time. Peru's leftist administration presented a new framework for artisanal mining last week that declared artisanal mining is ""as important"" as big mining.Southern Copper has asked the government to revoke all artisanal mining permits on its concession. About half have now been canceled, causing resentment in Tapairihua.""We are going to defend ourselves. At the end of the day we are at home, and from home there is nowhere to go,"" Retamozo, a mining engineer and president of the Tapairihua Mining Association, told Reuters.While artisanal permits have existed since 2012, lower copper prices that decade meant they were not in demand. But copper has risen more than 60% since 2020 due to demand for electric vehicles.The surge in artisanal copper mining is forcing the government to review its artisanal permitting system, a mechanism that was meant to be a temporary bridge toward formalization and intended mostly for gold miners.""Our country is a mining country but we haven't had until now a mining framework that gives a long-term view about small-scale mining,"" Alberto Rojas, Peru's top mining formalization official, told ReutersRojas, however, suggested artisanal miners would lose in a dispute against concession holders.""Where we have concessions we can't have (artisanal mining permits),"" Rojas said. ""We can't disavow the concessions that have already been granted.""DIGGERS, TRUCKSOn a recent day in Tapairihua, Reuters visited the artisanal mining operations, where dozens of wood and blue tarpaulin homes were erected, and tunnels supported with wooden beams burrowed into the steep rocky hillside.In Peru's Andes many feel the copper under the ground is a right, with mining dating back to the Incas and other cultures that existed before Spain's colonization. Tapairihua looks down onto the river Antabamba, meaning ""copper plain"" in the Andean Quechua language.Many of the miners are also local subsistence farmers who took up mining in search of income. Many declined to be named because they have been sued by Southern Copper over their mining activities.To extract copper, they use dynamite to explode rock that they bring out in wheelbarrows and bags. Miners earn 80 soles ($20.61) a day, extracting enough rock to fill a handful of trucks a week, usually containing around 5% copper, though this level can rise as high as 18%.Gherson Quintanilla arrived in Tapairihua earlier this year with a background in artisanal gold mining. He came because he heard copper was abundant and expertise was low.""My goal is to extract up to two truckloads a day,"" he told Reuters.But artisanal copper mining is not always as small scale.An internal Las Bambas presentation seen by Reuters estimated informal miners were blasting some 1,950 tonnes of rock per day, almost double their output a year ago.The report said artisanal miners were using heavy machinery and diggers as well as pneumatic tools.Overall, it estimated the government has issued 700 permits that overlap with Las Bambas's concession,But removing those miners is not straightforward. While Las Bambas and Southern Copper hold mining rights - which grants them access to the mineral underground - in most cases they have yet to buy the property rights to the surface terrain.That limits their options because they cannot file an eviction claim on land they do not own.The source close to Las Bambas said MMG recognized this difficulty and anticipated it would have to buy out the miners if it wants them to leave the site of its third pit, set to open in 2027 - if there are no delays.At the site of its second pit, which was supposed to open this year, Las Bambas has filed eviction claims against the miners there because it already owns that particular parcel of land. The company estimates almost a dozen mining sites in the area. Reuters was unable to determine the number of miners working in them.'FUEL TO THE FIRE'In May, Southern Copper sued Retamozo and other Tapairihua miners, saying their mining permits were non-compliant.Weeks later a fire destroyed Southern Copper's local headquarters, which is made up of tents, just minutes downhill from where the small-scale miners are operating. Burned-out cars remain there today.Nobody was hurt in the fire and no arrests have been made. Peruvian authorities say the matter remains under investigation.The miners have distanced themselves from the arson, though Retamozo acknowledged the lawsuits have angered them and that some individual members may have acted out of ""resentment.""The number of valid artisanal mining permits in Tapairihua has fallen from 100 to 32 since May, according to government records. An internal mining ministry document seen by Reuters shows that the process is under way to revoke the remaining permits.Retamozo cautioned about what would happen if those were canceled.""Canceling them would add fuel to the fire,"" he said.

""Volkswagen and other automakers have to include cobalt in their hedging programmes.""Volkswagen makes electric vehicles which use batteries containing cobalt. The German automaker told Reuters it does not use the CME's cobalt futures, but it trades bilaterally with banks using cash-settled OTC contracts.Banks then hedge their exposure to Volkswagen using CME cobalt, a second source familiar with the matter said.Volumes on the CME's cash-settled cobalt contract, launched in December 2020, have climbed 273% to 11,003 tonnes in the 10 months to end-October from the same period last year.Story continuesOpen interest, the number of outstanding contracts held by the market, for CME cobalt at 8,258 tonnes in October has jumped 352% from the same period last year. Open interest is spread across maturities from November 2022 to December 2025.CME Group declined to comment.The LME's cash-settled cobalt contract has not traded since its launch in 2019, while interest in its physically-deliverable contract has faded, evidenced by a 68% drop in volumes to 238 tonnes in Jan-Oct from the same period last year.Open interest on the LME's physically deliverable contract has been stuck at 13 tonnes since August compared with levels near 800 tonnes in December 2018.""CME brokers want to make the contract work. LME brokers don't care, it's not a core offering for them,"" the second source familiar with the matter said.LME declined to comment.According to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI), cobalt demand from the battery sector accounted for 47% of the total at 88,147 tonnes in 2015.BMI expects cobalt demand for batteries to rise to 68% at nearly 164,000 tonnes this year and 82% at 360,231 tonnes by 2030.Most of that growth will come from electric vehicles batteries, according to BMI analyst Caspar Rawles. Cobalt ensures batteries do not easily overheat or catch fire and it helps extend their life, which automakers typically guarantee for eight to 10 years.Glencore produced 31,300 tonnes of cobalt last year, much of it in the Democratic Republic of Congo where it is a byproduct of copper. Cobalt is also a byproduct of nickel production. (Reporting by Pratima Desai; Editing by Veronica Brown and Arun Koyyur)]"

Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds‘God have mercy on us all’: Robert Kiyosaki warned that the economy is the ‘biggest bubble’ in history and urged investors to dump paper assets — here are 3 real assets he likes instead“I believe economy is the biggest bubble in world history,” he said in a tweet. “God have mercy on us all.”Since a lot of financial assets have gotten cheaper in this market downturn, it might be tempting to buy the dip. But that’s not what Kiyosaki is doing.“Many of you know I do not invest in equities, bonds, ETS or MFs. Please DO NOT listen to what I’m going to say next: ‘I would get out of paper assets’,” he says, adding that the world economy “is not a ‘market.’”Instead, Kiyosaki likes three real assets for protection. Here’s a look at each one of them.Gold and silverPrecious metals — particularly gold and silver — have been a popular hedge against inflation and uncertainty. They can’t be printed out of thin air like fiat money and their value is largely unaffected by economic events around the world.Kiyosaki has long been a fan of gold — he first purchased the yellow metal in 1972.“I’m not buying gold because I like gold, I’m buying gold because I don’t trust the Fed,” he said in an interview last year.Kiyosaki likes silver, too. In fact, he tweeted “Silver best investment in Oct 2022” and “Everyone can afford $20 silver.”To be sure, precious metals weren’t immune to the sell-off that was happening in 2022. That being said, both metals are showing promise so far in 2023 with gold and silver both up around 5% over the past three months.Story continuesWhile there are many ways to gain exposure to gold and silver, Kiyosaki prefers to just buy the metal directly. Earlier in 2022, he tweeted that he only wants “real gold or silver coins” and not ETFs.The author also called silver “a bargain” recently. So it might be time to visit your local bullion shop.BitcoinBitcoin investors have learned the hard way just how volatile it can be.In November 2021, bitcoin reached a high of $68,990. As of Thursday, it was hovering around $32,015.17.But Kiyosaki doesn’t seem bothered by the cryptocurrency’s downturn.“BITCOIN? WORRIED? No,” he writes in a November tweet. “I am a Bitcoin investor as I am an investor in physical gold, silver, &amp; real estate.”In fact, he sees the crypto mayhem as an opportunity.“When BITCOIN hits new bottom, $10 to $12 k? I will get EXCITED, not worried.”Kiyosaki believes in bitcoin for the same reason he loves precious metals: a distrust in our fiat money system and the government.“I bet against the Fed, Treasury, Biden, &amp; bet on [gold], [silver], &amp; Bitcoin,” he explained.In December 2022, he tweeted another reason for his continued interest in the crypto coin.""Bitcoin is classified as a commodity much like gold, silver, and oil. Most crypto tokens are classifed as a security and SEC regulations will crush most of them. I am buying more BC""These days, it’s very easy to tap into bitcoin: you can buy bitcoin directly. Just be aware that many exchanges charge up to 4% in commission fees just to buy and sell crypto.

The dollar index dropped nearly 1%. The greenback has rallied sharply this year partially due to it safe haven status amid Russia-Ukraine conflict and prospects of aggressive monetary policy tightening by the U.S. central bank. Powell said the Fed has been ""pretty aggressive"" already with its rate hikes and won't try to crash the economy with further sharp increases just to get price rises under control faster.

The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, read around 5% in October, well above the Fed’s 2% target.But Powell’s comments still sparked a broad-based rally in metal markets, as the prospect of slower rate hikes offered some near-term relief to markets battered by rising interest rates this year.Spot gold rose 0.5% to $1,778.20 an ounce, while gold futures expiring in February rallied 1.8% to $1,791.25 an ounce, their highest level since mid-August. Both instruments surged over 1% on Wednesday.Gold prices also logged strong gains in November as several Fed officials flagged smaller rate hikes in the coming months.Still, the outlook for the yellow metal is clouded by uncertainty over where U.S. interest rates will peak, given that the Fed’s terminal rate will be largely determined by the path of U.S. inflation.Among industrial metals, copper prices surged to an over two-week high on positive signals on a potential reopening in China.Copper futures were steady around $3.7838 a pound on Thursday, after rallying over 4% in the prior session- their best day in nearly a month.China scaled back COVID-related restrictions in two major cities this week amid growing public opposition to the country’s strict zero-COVID policy, which saw unprecedented protests rock several parts of the country.Story continuesChina’s zero-COVID policy caused widespread economic disruption in the country this year, denting business activities and also weighing on its appetite for commodities.But a potential reopening in the world’s largest copper importer is largely expected to trigger a recovery in demand, benefiting copper prices.Related ArticlesGold hits over 3-month high as Powell flags slower rate hikesOil edges higher on tight supply, China demand recovery optimismBiden nominee to be ambassador to Russia pledges to prioritize prisoner release]"

As part of that initiative, and in partnership with the national community development non-profit LISC, Verizon is offering small business owners a chance to apply for $10,000 small business grants. In 2022, Verizon has committed to fund more than $1M in grants, exclusive to Small Business Digital Ready users. Here, four of them share how they applied their funds - and new learnings from the Digital Ready courses - to boost their businesses in remarkable ways.Verizon, Wednesday, November 30, 2022, Press release pictureAfter immigrating from Iran to the U.S., Ahmad and Ency Moghaddam founded the ASM Educational Center (ASM) in 1992 along with their adult son and daughter in Rockville, MD. Since then, the family business has trained more than 38,000 professionals in IT, as well as other technical skills. ""We are proud of our legacy and the opportunity to help so many people,"" says Ency.Due to the pandemic, the center's clientbase contracted and shifted their in-person courses to virtual instruction. Azita Moghaddam, Chief Customer Officer and daughter of Ency and Ahmad, was actively helping the business transform when she applied for and got the Digital Ready grant.Q. How was the grant helpful in supporting ASM?A. To be honest, that win felt so good and confirmed for us that we were still on track. With the grant, we also put a bit more capital into our overall operation to maintain the customer-facing office and supplement instructor salaries. ASM is now charting new levels of success and expanding vital programs, including career skills training to Afghan refugees.Q. Did the other Digital Ready resources help ASM?A. I took several courses that covered revenue generating activities, procurement pathways for MWBEs, and business planning. I felt a mental shift after completing the Planning for the Unexpected: Building Resiliency Into Your Business course. I'm now more excited to embrace the future and accelerate a continuity plan for the family business.Story continuesQ. What would you say is the key to making a family business work?A. Loving and supporting each other unconditionally and knowing that we are truly living our motto, changing lives through education. That's the reason we work hard every day and why my 89-year old dad still comes to work to inspire all our students, especially our youth.Jaja Chen and Devin Li started their premium dumpling and boba tea company, Cha Community, in 2018. The business is based in Waco, Texas and focuses as much on building community as creating tasty goods. Chen and Li were in the midst of opening their second café when the pandemic struck, inspiring Chen to go after the grant.Q. How did the pandemic impact the opening of your new location?A. Initially things were going according to plan. But when construction costs skyrocketed we found we needed more funding to complete the project.Q. How did the grant help Cha Community at that pivotal time?A. The grant was a game-changer for our small business. We had challenges with navigating COVID-19 federal relief dollars, and as a result had limited cash flow as the pandemic put pressure on our business. With the help of the Verizon grant, we were able to finish building out our boba tea café in Temple, Texas without taking on more debt. It was just the help needed to offset construction costs and keep the project flowing. We successfully opened in March 2022.Q. How is business going?A. Downtown Temple has truly welcomed us and been an immense support for us. Our focus now is increasing catering and food truck pop-up events throughout the communities we are a part of. We are also increasing leadership development within the company and planning to grow Cha Community throughout Central Texas.Joe Alvarez and Erick Casillas launched iCareClean in Los Angeles, CA, in 2016. In just six years, they grew the office-cleaning business from a single client to more than 100, and expanded to include event cleanup services. The pandemic caused difficulty for the entrepreneurs as client offices closed and demand for cleaning dropped dramatically. Fortunately, Alvarez and Casillas had been working with LISC, where they both gained new business skills and also learned about Verizon Small Business Digital Ready. Alvarez applied for and received the $10,000 grant.Q. How did the grant help your company during the pandemic?A. Once the pandemic hit, we had to change our way of thinking. After taking Verizon courses and getting the grant, we invested in our digital marketing strategy. Our approach became more Google ads in online search results, as well as social media.Q. What was the impact of your digital marketing investment?A. One search engine campaign allowed our business to be ranked on various neighborhood-related searches. That resulted in 20 additional customers. The company is now on target to hit $3 million in revenue this year.Q. What has success meant for you and your family?A. Owning a business and having the ability to care for and encourage growth and development for my two sons has meant everything. My daily affirmations to them are to love, serve and forgive big.

Some of the stocks recently backed by Jim Cramer ahead of a potential market recovery include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). He explained: “If we can see the end of the purchasing spree … It's a huge positive for stocks. It helps that we’ve finally worked out the kinks in the supply chain that were creating shortages all over the place. Put it all together, and there’s a real possibility the Fed can indeed engineer a fabled soft landing for the economy.”On November 21, Cramer forecasted that the S&amp;P 500 will potentially rally next month. He referred to the market scenario where stocks climb close to the end of the year. He interpreted Larry Williams’ model of the S&amp;P 500 index’s seasonal pattern, noting: “Between the seasonal pattern and the short-term cycle, and also the extremely positive long-term cycle that we covered a few weeks ago, he’s seeing a lot of green lights to start buying.”Our Methodology These stocks were picked keeping in mind the latest calls that Jim Cramer made on these equities during his appearances on news platform CNBC in November 2022. Jim Cramer Stock Portfolio: 10 Recent AdditionsJim Cramer Stock Portfolio: Recent Additions10.

(NYSE:MP) is a Las Vegas-based company that owns and operates rare earth mining and processing facilities, offering rare earth minerals including cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, praseodymium, and samarium. In Cramer’s lightning round on November 18, he told viewers: “It’s doing a great job, they’ve got a contract with GM ... GM’s a winner, and so is MP.”Story continues MP Materials Corp. (NYSE:MP) is one of the recent stock picks of Jim Cramer. On November 3, MP Materials Corp. (NYSE:MP) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.36 and a revenue of $124.45 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.06 and $6.73 million, respectively. Revenue for the period climbed approximately 25% year-over-year, supported by an increase in the realized price of rare earth oxide.Canaccord analyst George Gianarikas on September 28 maintained a Buy rating on MP Materials Corp. (NYSE:MP) but lowered the price target on the shares to $40 from $47. The analyst reduced his estimates due to weakness in NdPr prices, a trend he observed from late August. However, he justified his rating given the value creation path in stages 2 and 3 of the company's evolution and MP Materials Corp. (NYSE:MP)’s increasing strategic importance.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 36 hedge funds were bullish on MP Materials Corp. (NYSE:MP) at the end of September 2022, compared to 26 funds in the prior quarter. Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), MP Materials Corp. (NYSE:MP) is one of the stocks favored by Jim Cramer.  ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about MP Materials Corp. (NYSE:MP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“ClearBridge has visited and engaged with holding MP Materials Corp. (NYSE:MP), for example, a U.S. mining company with a facility that supplies neodymium and praseodymium, two rare earth minerals used to make powerful magnets found in 90% of EV motors. The facility recycles all water from its process such that recycled water meets 95% of the facility’s water needs, while the rest comes from groundwater. In the recycling process, wastewater is piped to an on-site water treatment plant where it is treated using reverse osmosis and then reused. In a recent engagement with the company, we encouraged it to disclose the groundwater extraction quantities that make up the other 5% and compare these to peers.”9. Howmet Aerospace Inc. (NYSE:HWM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Howmet Aerospace Inc. (NYSE:HWM) is a Pennsylvania-based company that specializes in advanced engineered solutions for the aerospace and transportation industries worldwide. It operates through four segments – Engine Products, Fastening Systems, Engineered Structures, and Forged Wheels. The company expects 2023 revenue growth versus 2022 to be up approximately 10%.

(NYSE:HWM), compared to 39 funds in the earlier quarter. Paul Singer’s Elliott Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with more than 36 million shares worth $1.11 billion. 8. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a California-based semiconductor company operating worldwide. On November 22, the Mad Money host said: “Once the Fed relents, I’d much rather be in Big Tech, or the top cloud plays, or the better-run chipmakers like AMD and Nvidia.” Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the latest stocks backed by Cramer. On November 15, Credit Suisse analyst Chris Caso initiated coverage of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) with an Outperform rating and a $90 price target. He expects improved server share gains and cloud market growth, the analyst wrote in a research note.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 89 funds reported owning stakes worth $5 billion in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 87 funds in the prior quarter worth $4.8 billion. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held the largest stake in the company, consisting of 19.4 million shares valued at $1.2 billion. Here is what Baron Opportunity Fund has to say about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global fabless semiconductor company focusing on high-performance computing technology, software, and products. AMD designs leading high-performance central and graphics processing units (known as CPUs and GPUs) and integrates them with hardware and software to build differentiated solutions for customers.AMD has been gaining meaningful share in personal computing and server end markets over the past several years driven by the performance of its processors and technology and strong execution against its technology roadmap, and we believe share gains will continue over the coming years from a combination of AMD’s continued advancements and Intel’s stumbles in developing its leading-edge technology.Additionally, the recently closed acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando enhance AMD’s positioning within the data center, a key growth engine for the semiconductor industry, and Xilinx specifically opens up several new growth opportunities in new end markets like industrial, automotive, and communications. The company also generates significant cash flow, giving it capital allocation optionality for further M&amp;A and returning capital to shareholders.”7. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a California-based company that provides graphics, computing, semiconductors, and networking solutions in the United States, Taiwan, China, and internationally. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the semiconductor stocks backed by Jim Cramer. Cramer’s Charitable Trust owns shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). On November 17, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill raised the price target on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to $200 from $155 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The company's Q3 results were ""solid"" with data center revenue outlook somewhat higher despite soft China data center sales and accelerating H100 adoption, the analyst told investors in a research note. He added that while China is weighing on overall results, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is executing nicely despite these headwinds.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 89 hedge funds were long NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), compared to 84 funds in the last quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 3.3 million shares worth $410.8 million. Vulcan Value Partners made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also sold NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) during the quarter to allocate capital to new purchases and to add to existing positions in the portfolio. NVIDIA is facing multiple headwinds. Data center revenue growth is slowing, gaming revenue growth is declining, and the United States has issued new export controls to China that impact NVDIA’s products. We believe NVDIA’s competitive advantages are intact, and it remains on our MVP list. In the right circumstances we would be delighted to own it in the future.”6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the leading American entertainment conglomerates. On November 21, CNBC’s Jim Cramer said that he is bullish on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) now that Bob Iger is back to the chief executive role. He further elaborated: “Disney’s the defining story of the day. This is a good example of how you can stick with an iconic company … and make money when they bring in a better leader. And that’s exactly what I see happening as Iger takes the helm.” Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth on November 22 maintained a Buy rating on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) but lowered the price target on the shares to $177 from $229 given a re-rating of value due to near-term linear network pressure. Nonetheless, the analyst sees the return of former CEO Bob Iger leading the company back to creativity, and likes the ongoing release of blockbuster content, which will continue to drive growth. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s robust balance sheet, cash flow, and prudent capital allocation will allow it to invest in content development, new theme park attractions, and growth initiatives, the analyst added. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is on his Research Focus List and Focus Opportunity Portfolio.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 112 hedge funds were bullish on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), compared to 109 funds in the earlier quarter. Arrowstreet Capital held a prominent position in the company, with 3.5 million shares worth about $331 million. Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the stocks recently backed by Jim Cramer. Here is what Third Point specifically said about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“As disclosed in our Q2 letter, we reinitiated a significant position in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) when the company retested its Covid lows earlier this year. At the current price, Disney is trading for little more than the stand-alone value of its Parks business and a mere 15x ’24 “street” consensus. The company remains early in its Direct to Consumer (“DTC”) transition with a leading market position, and yet the current stock price ascribes negligible value to the streaming business. We believe this is due to questions around the terminal economics of streaming, given large losses being generated today at Disney (&gt;$1 billion dollars last quarter) and stagnating margins at peers such as Netflix. On the last earnings call, management highlighted three items that could lead to an inflection in DTC profitability over the next 12 months: a 38% price increase for Disney+ in the US; moderating growth in cash content expense; and an advertising tier for Disney+ launching in two months that can drive additional ARPU given high demand for the Disney brand amongst advertisers.While the company has guided Disney+ achieving breakeven sometime within the fiscal year ending September 2024, the valuation suggests the market remains skeptical. Disney only trades at ~14x the $7 in earnings generated prior to the Fox acquisition, which implies investors don’t expect earnings to meaningfully exceed this figure in the coming years. Hence, the first value driver we highlighted in our last letter is the opportunity for management to optimize Disney’s cost base to drive earnings growth. We believe Disney has ample means to rationalize costs across its operating platform and deliver targeted content for home viewing that does not entail the same cost structure of exclusive theatrical releases…” (Click here to view the full text) Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Stock Portfolio: 5 Recent Additions.  Suggested articles:15 Most Valuable Telecom Companies in the World11 Best Gas Stocks To Buy10 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:INTU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We took advantage of its 2022 price decline to add a small position in Intuit. INTU is a leading SaaS software solutions provider to small businesses, consumers, and professional accountants, best known for its QuickBooks accounting and TurboTax tax preparation platforms. INTU recently strengthened its personal finance offerings with the acquisitions of Mint and Credit Karma, and its small business offering with the acquisition of email marketing platform Mailchimp. The company is benefitting from the secular shift to digitization for both businesses and consumers. Given its vast amount of valuable personal finance and tax customer data from its 100 million + customer installed base, the company can apply artificial intelligence to the data to generate actionable intelligence for customers, as well as a large cross-selling opportunity across its products.Given INTU’s less than 5% penetration of its $300 billion market, we believe the company can grow its top-line mid-teens, while improving its high-margin business model of greater than 80% gross margins and greater than 35% EBITDA margin, leading to high-teens EPS growth for the foreseeable future. At about 2% of revenue, the company also requires limited capital expenditures, producing significant and growing FCF, which INTU has used for acquisitions, a small dividend, debt repayment and stock buybacks.”12.

During the quarter Danaher announced the spin of its Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions group (EAS) expected to close in late 2023. Danaher have been masters of the spin over the last decade and once again this one appears to make sense for both parties. The parent becomes a pure-play life sciences and diagnostics business with higher growth, margins and returns plus more M&amp;A firepower. EAS, with leading positions in water quality through assets like Hach, ChemTreat and Trojan will, as a standalone business, have a more focused M&amp;A strategy and represent an attractive water-related exposure for ESG focused funds. The spinco will still operate with the highly regarded Danaher Business System though (like ‘Fortive Business System’) we expect this to get rebranded while still delivering outstanding financial results.”10. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89The Home Depot, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) shares were more resilient in Q3 as the company continues to perform well and reiterated guidance despite increasing market concerns regarding general inflationary pressures and the impact rising mortgage rates may have on the housing market. We view the longterm prospects and multi-year fundamental outlook as unchanged. Home improvement through repair and remodel is likely to be one of more resilient housing-related industries given the relative attractiveness for consumers to renovate existing homes rather than reset their current low fixed mortgage rate to higher rates that we’re seeing today.”9. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is an American company that specializes in financial information and analytics.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Shares of rating agency and data provider S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) fell 9% during the third quarter due to continued weak debt issuance activity and headwinds to the Indices business from equity market declines. Credit markets were exceptionally soft during the quarter with non-financial corporate bond issuance down 36% for investment grade and down 84% for high yield, reflecting greater investor risk aversion, rising interest rates, and a drop-off in M&amp;A activity. We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year. Over the long term, the company should continue benefiting from the secular trends of increasing bond issuance, growth in passive investing, and demand for data and analytics, while enjoying meaningful and durable competitive advantages that, in our view, are only strengthening following the merger with IHS Markit.”8.

Berkshire Hathaway was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.Here is what Artisan Partners said about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We made only one new purchase during the quarter, initiating a position in Bank of America (BAC). As one of America’s largest banks, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is second only to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in size and is probably its closest peer. Both are well-run banks, but compared to JPM, since the GFC, BAC has retired more shares, grown EPS faster and currently has more capital and a lower dividend payout. We are attracted to BAC’s strong capital base, high capital generation capacity, large loan loss reserve, low (~50%) loan/deposit ratio, short duration investment securities book, and low dividend payout that provides financial flexibility. BAC has a less volatile earnings stream than JPM with lower capital market sensitive exposures. Additionally, BAC is rigorously stress tested by the Fed every year in quantitative and qualitative fashion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which we hold in the portfolio, owns 12% of BAC. He petitioned the Fed to own more than 10%, so he clearly likes it. Bank stocks were strong gainers in 2021 on the prospects of higher rates boosting net interest margins, but the stocks pulled back in the first half of 2022 on economic concerns. We believe BAC has massive scale advantages, should benefit from increasing interest rates, particularly in the 2-year part of the yield curve, and should grow over time with the economy. The economic environment is highly uncertain, but current consensus includes the provision for losses more than doubling and capital markets activity slowing. Against that backdrop, our purchase price equated to about 8.5X our estimates of “mid-cycle” earnings. With leading businesses, a double-digit ROE, a prudent capital return strategy and a strong balance sheet, we believe this entry point offers a solid long-term value.”6. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is an American multinational investment bank and financial services holding company.

If you want to read about some more safe stocks, go directly to 5 Safe Stocks to Buy For Beginner Investors.The collapse of the cryptocurrency market in the past few months has highlighted the perils of investing in speculative assets, especially to retail investors or beginners who had only just begun their investing careers and now face the daunting prospect of losing a vast portion of their wealth due to the slowing macro environment. In addition to crypto, other riskier growth stocks are also down. The NASDAQ Composite, made up primarily of tech-heavy firms, is down close to 30% year-to-date, as of November 28. However, the shares of established tech giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) have withstood the macro pressures better than feared. This resilience has underlined the importance of balancing portfolios with safe stocks that offer reliable dividend payouts and have pricing power to protect against inflation. Beginner investors, who have gained in prominence on Wall Street since the GameStop short squeeze saga of early 2021, should study the investing habits of titans like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, or elite hedge funds, to understand these concepts better. Our MethodologyThe companies that have established business models that have demonstrated historical resilience against inflationary headwinds were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.14 Safe Stocks to Buy For Beginner InvestorsPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashSafe Stocks to Buy For Beginner Investors14.

We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”13.

(NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”11.

As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”10.

Here is what the fund said:“In 2014, before we began to invest in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), I called Roger to ask whether he thought Elon Musk’s electric car business would succeed. I did not believe that Roger, an owner of dealerships that sell cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) would likely have a favorable opinion of Tesla’s prospects. That was principally for two reasons:First, automobile manufacturing and distribution is unusually complicated, capital intensive, and highly regulated, which makes profitability problematic;second, cars with ICE motors require extensive annual maintenance, and dealer services revenues, not profits from automobile sales, are the most important contributor to profits of perpetual licensed ICE car dealerships.Penske Automotive Group is principally an ICE car dealer. Since electric cars are powered by batteries and need little service, franchised dealerships are incented to sell ICE, not EV automobiles. Further, Roger had been a long-term director of General Motors. General Motors’ ICE automobile business would be disrupted if Tesla were successful. (click here to read more…)8.

Here is what the fund said:“At the company-specific level, there was a broad correction across the entire portfolio. While four of our holdings contributed to performance, the contribution to absolute returns was less than 100bps combined, as unfortunately none of them was large enough to move the needle. We had 16 investments detracting over 100bps each with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), our second largest detractor, costing the Fund 254bps.NVIDIA’s stock was hit even harder, down 44.4%, impacted by concerns over the health of the consumer, dramatic declines in crypto, and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Despite the sell-off and the increased near-term volatility in its gaming business, NVIDIA’s revenues grew 46% year-over-year with 48% operating margins, driven by continued strength in its data center business as companies across industries adopt AI and ML…(read more)7.

More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Safe Stocks to Buy For Beginner Investors. Suggested Articles:12 Best Nancy Pelosi Stocks To BuyTop 10 Green Hydrogen Companies in the World15 Best Self-Driving Car Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

NVRO is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its solid foothold in the Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) market. The optimism led by a solid third-quarter 2022 performance and continued strength in its flagship Senza platform are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and dependence on third-party payors persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 49.5% compared with the 23.8% decline of the industry and 13.9% fall of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $1.57 billion. The company projects 103.2% growth for 2022 and expects to maintain its strong performance. Nevro’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and broke even in the other, the average earnings surprise being 9.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Solid Foothold in SCS Market: Nevro’s foothold in the global SCS therapy business raises our optimism about the stock. In October, the company announced that the FDA had approved its manufacturing operations in Costa Rica for the production of its proprietary SCS systems for treating chronic pain, including its HFX product platform.During the third-quarter earnings release, Nevro announced multiple positive payer coverage updates for the treatment of PDN from Aetna and several additional Blue Cross Blue Shield health plans.Strength in Senza: We are optimistic about Nevro’s continued strength in its flagship Senza platform. Based on analysis from the company’s SENZA- Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) and European studies, as well as the SENZA-PDN and SENZA-NSRBP (non-surgical refractory back pain) RCTs, Nevro believes the 10 kHz therapy can be an attractive treatment option for patients. Due to the removal of paresthesia, the company believes that the 10 kHz therapy can also be effective for patients with chronic upper limb and neck pain. In October, Nevro received the FDA’s approval for the Senza HFX iQ SCS system.Story continuesStrong Q3 Results: Nevro’s better-than-expected third-quarter 2022 results buoy optimism. The company recorded an improvement in overall top line and robust domestic revenues. An uptick in total U.S. permanent implant procedures and U.S. trial procedures were also seen. The sequential improvement in U.S. PDN trial procedures was encouraging.DownsidesDependence on Third-Party Payors: Nevro’s success in marketing its products largely depends on whether U.S. and international government health administrative authorities, private health insurers and other organizations adequately cover and reimburse customers for the cost of its products. Access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for SCS procedures using Senza by third-party payors is essential for the acceptance of Nevro’s products by its customers.Stiff Competition: Nevro operates in a highly competitive medical device industry, which is subject to technological change. The company’s success depends partly upon its ability to establish a competitive position in the neuromodulation market by securing broad market acceptance of its HF10 therapy and Senza products for the treatment of approved chronic pain conditions.Estimate TrendNevro has been witnessing an upward estimate revision trend for 2022. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved from a loss of $2.24 per share to earnings of 12 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $112.7 million, suggesting a 9.7% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

PKI is well poised for growth, courtesy of a robust product portfolio and impressive margin expansion. However, forex remains a concern.Shares of this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 33.5% compared with the industry’s decline of 20.3% so far this year. The S&amp;P 500 Index has fallen 18% in the same time frame.PerkinElmer — with a market capitalization of $16.87 billion — offers scientific instruments, consumables and services to pharmaceutical, biomedical, environmental testing, chemical and general industrial markets worldwide. Its earnings are anticipated to improve 46.5% over the next five years. The company pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.82%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKey CatalystsPerkinElmer provides a comprehensive suite of scientific informatics and software solutions to aggregate data into actionable insights in an automated and scalable way.In November, PerkinElmer recently launched ready-to-use Adeno-associated Virus Vectors (AAV) Detection Kits to aid researchers working on gene therapies for various serious diseases. The validated and fully-automatable assays are built on PerkinElmer's proprietary AlphaLISA technology. The latest launch will likely expand PerkinElmer's cell and gene therapy portfolio, which includes gene editing and modulation, cell counting, antibody and flow cytometry innovations. This will enable the company to significantly strengthen its Life Sciences business unit in the broader Discovery &amp; Analytical Solutions segment.PerkinElmer received the FDA’s marketing authorization for the EONIS SCID-SMA assay kit for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use by certified laboratories for the simultaneous detection of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in newborns. PerkinElmer’s Oxford Immunotec announced that the FDA approved the use of the T-Cell Select reagent kit to automate its T-SPOT.TB test workflow for IVD use by certified laboratories in September. These latest regulatory clearances are likely to aid PerkinElmer in significantly solidifying its foothold in the global IVD space and boosting its Diagnostics business.Story continuesThe company launched a unique benchtop platform, Cellaca PLX Image Cytometry System, in September. The system is expected to enable researchers to evaluate multiple Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) of cell samples in a single automated workflow, including cell identity, quality and quantity.The company’s gross margin continues to improve on the back of productivity initiatives and volume leverage. The product introductions are anticipated to enhance the product mix, thus increasing the gross margin. This, coupled with stringent cost control, will continue to drive the operating margin in the near term.On the third-quarter 2022 earnings call, the company demonstrated solid performance despite ongoing macro headwinds like inflationary pressure. Pro-forma adjusted revenues that include sales from held-for-sale business — Applied, Food and Enterprise Services — were up 9% organically after the exclusion of revenue growth sales from COVID products. Revenues from continuing operations were down 17% year over year and 23% organically.Factor Hurting the StockGrowing exposure to the international markets makes the company susceptible to foreign exchange volatility. The unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates can hurt PerkinElmer’s international sales. In the third quarter, foreign exchange was a 6% headwind to revenues. For the fourth quarter of 2022, the company projects a 7% headwind from foreign exchange and 5% for the full year of 2022. Its adjusted gross margin decreased 110 basis points to 64%. The company’s adjusted operating margin was also down 600 basis points to 31.4%.Estimate TrendPerkinElmer has been witnessing an upward estimate revision trend for 2022.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Travelers Companies'  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Travelers Companies How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Travelers Companies is:17% = US$3.4b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.17 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Travelers Companies' Earnings Growth And 17% ROETo start with, Travelers Companies' ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 13% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This certainly adds some context to Travelers Companies' decent 12% net income growth seen over the past five years.We then performed a comparison between Travelers Companies' net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 12% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for TRV? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Travelers Companies Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Travelers Companies has a three-year median payout ratio of 31%, which implies that it retains the remaining 69% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Besides, Travelers Companies has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 23% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the lower expected payout ratio.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Travelers Companies' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at Genuine Parts' (NYSE:GPC) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Genuine Parts, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.20 = US$1.8b ÷ (US$16b - US$7.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Genuine Parts has an ROCE of 20%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Retail Distributors industry average of 15%. See our latest analysis for Genuine Parts roceIn the above chart we have measured Genuine Parts' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Genuine Parts here  for free.What Can We Tell From Genuine Parts' ROCE Trend?It's hard not to be impressed by Genuine Parts' returns on capital. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 20% and the business has deployed 88% more capital into its operations. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 20%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. You'll see this when looking at well operated businesses or favorable business models.Story continuesOn a separate but related note, it's important to know that Genuine Parts has a current liabilities to total assets ratio of 46%, which we'd consider pretty high. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.The Bottom Line On Genuine Parts' ROCEIn the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 122% return they've received over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Genuine Parts and understanding it should be part of your investment process.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

278,1a5519ff-3efa-3187-9885-c34cee36c794,FOX,2022-12-01,Can Mixed Fundamentals Have A Negative Impact on Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) Current Share Price Momentum?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mixed-fundamentals-negative-impact-fox-165956769.html,1669827596,STORY,['FOXA'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Fox's (NASDAQ:FOXA) stock increased significantly by 10.0% over the past month. However, we wonder if the company's inconsistent financials would have any adverse impact on the current share price momentum. In this article, we decided to focus on Fox's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Fox How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Fox is:9.7% = US$1.1b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.10 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Fox's Earnings Growth And 9.7% ROEWhen you first look at it, Fox's ROE doesn't look that attractive. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 12%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the five year net income decline of 9.0% seen by Fox was probably the result of it having a lower ROE. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. For example, it is possible that the business has allocated capital poorly or that the company has a very high payout ratio.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Fox's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 1.1% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Fox's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Fox Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Fox's low three-year median payout ratio of 19% (or a retention ratio of 81%) over the last three years should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth but the company's earnings have actually shrunk. This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For instance, the business has faced some headwinds.Moreover, Fox has been paying dividends for four years, which is a considerable amount of time, suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer consistent dividends even though earnings have been shrinking. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 18% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Fox's future ROE will rise to 15% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOverall, we have mixed feelings about Fox. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Robinson is one of the world's largest logistics platforms, with nearly $30 billion in freight under management. The company provides freight transportation and logistics, as well as outsource solutions, information services, and beyond to roughly 100,000 global customers.In general, the third-party logistics industry offers room for expansion in a globally-interconnected world, where streamlined shipping and transportation services are paramount. C.H. Robinson’s revenue climbed 6% in 2020 and 43% in 2021.Recent SetbacksThe firm was looking solid through the first half of 2022, but the slowing economy is finally catching up. “On our second quarter earnings call in late July, I talked about a deceleration in demand that we expected to see in the second half of 2022 in three large verticals for freight, including weakness in the retail market and further slowing in the housing market. We’re now seeing those expectations play out,” CEO Bob Biesterfeld said in prepared Q3 remarks in early November.  C.H. Robinson’s third quarter revenue fell 4% as did its adjusted earnings. Both figures came in below Zacks estimates, with the logistics firm missing our EPS estimate by 17%. The company’s operating expenses climbed 12%.

Value tickets cost $105, regular tickets cost $110 and peak tickets cost $124 each.Jedi94 / Wikimedia Commons2017: $115Price increase from previous year: $5Cost adjusted for 2021 inflation: $123.56In 2017, a new family-style raft ride debuted at Typhoon Lagoon Water Park, and Disney welcomed Pandora -- The World of Avatar.

He explained: “If we can see the end of the purchasing spree … It's a huge positive for stocks. It helps that we’ve finally worked out the kinks in the supply chain that were creating shortages all over the place. Put it all together, and there’s a real possibility the Fed can indeed engineer a fabled soft landing for the economy.”On November 21, Cramer forecasted that the S&amp;P 500 will potentially rally next month. He referred to the market scenario where stocks climb close to the end of the year. He interpreted Larry Williams’ model of the S&amp;P 500 index’s seasonal pattern, noting: “Between the seasonal pattern and the short-term cycle, and also the extremely positive long-term cycle that we covered a few weeks ago, he’s seeing a lot of green lights to start buying.”Our Methodology These stocks were picked keeping in mind the latest calls that Jim Cramer made on these equities during his appearances on news platform CNBC in November 2022. Jim Cramer Stock Portfolio: 10 Recent AdditionsJim Cramer Stock Portfolio: Recent Additions10.

AMD designs leading high-performance central and graphics processing units (known as CPUs and GPUs) and integrates them with hardware and software to build differentiated solutions for customers.AMD has been gaining meaningful share in personal computing and server end markets over the past several years driven by the performance of its processors and technology and strong execution against its technology roadmap, and we believe share gains will continue over the coming years from a combination of AMD’s continued advancements and Intel’s stumbles in developing its leading-edge technology.Additionally, the recently closed acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando enhance AMD’s positioning within the data center, a key growth engine for the semiconductor industry, and Xilinx specifically opens up several new growth opportunities in new end markets like industrial, automotive, and communications. The company also generates significant cash flow, giving it capital allocation optionality for further M&amp;A and returning capital to shareholders.”7. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a California-based company that provides graphics, computing, semiconductors, and networking solutions in the United States, Taiwan, China, and internationally. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the semiconductor stocks backed by Jim Cramer. Cramer’s Charitable Trust owns shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). On November 17, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill raised the price target on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to $200 from $155 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The company's Q3 results were ""solid"" with data center revenue outlook somewhat higher despite soft China data center sales and accelerating H100 adoption, the analyst told investors in a research note. He added that while China is weighing on overall results, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is executing nicely despite these headwinds.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 89 hedge funds were long NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), compared to 84 funds in the last quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 3.3 million shares worth $410.8 million. Vulcan Value Partners made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also sold NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) during the quarter to allocate capital to new purchases and to add to existing positions in the portfolio. NVIDIA is facing multiple headwinds. Data center revenue growth is slowing, gaming revenue growth is declining, and the United States has issued new export controls to China that impact NVDIA’s products. We believe NVDIA’s competitive advantages are intact, and it remains on our MVP list. In the right circumstances we would be delighted to own it in the future.”6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the leading American entertainment conglomerates. On November 21, CNBC’s Jim Cramer said that he is bullish on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) now that Bob Iger is back to the chief executive role. He further elaborated: “Disney’s the defining story of the day. This is a good example of how you can stick with an iconic company … and make money when they bring in a better leader. And that’s exactly what I see happening as Iger takes the helm.” Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth on November 22 maintained a Buy rating on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) but lowered the price target on the shares to $177 from $229 given a re-rating of value due to near-term linear network pressure. Nonetheless, the analyst sees the return of former CEO Bob Iger leading the company back to creativity, and likes the ongoing release of blockbuster content, which will continue to drive growth. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)’s robust balance sheet, cash flow, and prudent capital allocation will allow it to invest in content development, new theme park attractions, and growth initiatives, the analyst added. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is on his Research Focus List and Focus Opportunity Portfolio.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 112 hedge funds were bullish on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), compared to 109 funds in the earlier quarter. Arrowstreet Capital held a prominent position in the company, with 3.5 million shares worth about $331 million. Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the stocks recently backed by Jim Cramer. Here is what Third Point specifically said about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“As disclosed in our Q2 letter, we reinitiated a significant position in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) when the company retested its Covid lows earlier this year. At the current price, Disney is trading for little more than the stand-alone value of its Parks business and a mere 15x ’24 “street” consensus. The company remains early in its Direct to Consumer (“DTC”) transition with a leading market position, and yet the current stock price ascribes negligible value to the streaming business. We believe this is due to questions around the terminal economics of streaming, given large losses being generated today at Disney (&gt;$1 billion dollars last quarter) and stagnating margins at peers such as Netflix. On the last earnings call, management highlighted three items that could lead to an inflection in DTC profitability over the next 12 months: a 38% price increase for Disney+ in the US; moderating growth in cash content expense; and an advertising tier for Disney+ launching in two months that can drive additional ARPU given high demand for the Disney brand amongst advertisers.While the company has guided Disney+ achieving breakeven sometime within the fiscal year ending September 2024, the valuation suggests the market remains skeptical. Disney only trades at ~14x the $7 in earnings generated prior to the Fox acquisition, which implies investors don’t expect earnings to meaningfully exceed this figure in the coming years. Hence, the first value driver we highlighted in our last letter is the opportunity for management to optimize Disney’s cost base to drive earnings growth. We believe Disney has ample means to rationalize costs across its operating platform and deliver targeted content for home viewing that does not entail the same cost structure of exclusive theatrical releases…” (Click here to view the full text) Click to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Stock Portfolio: 5 Recent Additions.  Suggested articles:15 Most Valuable Telecom Companies in the World11 Best Gas Stocks To Buy10 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

Funded in part with a $225,000 commitment from ComEd, the EV Readiness Program will help communities streamline policies and implement best practices for safe and effective regional transportation electrification.EVs – which provide cost savings, environmental and health benefits for communities – continue to grow in popularity and are expected to account for 50 percent of new vehicle sales by 2030. This is thanks in large part to the increased availability of state and federal incentives, and to Illinois’ landmark Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) passed in 2021, which calls for 1 million EVs on the road by 2030. Through programs like EV Readiness, ComEd is working with customers and community partners across the region to prepare for this influx and to help them meet goals for sustainability and EV adoption.""Working alongside partners at the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus and others in the region, ComEd is helping eliminate barriers so that our communities from every corner of northern Illinois have a chance to access the benefits of EVs, which lower tailpipe emissions and bring cleaner air into our communities,"" said ComEd CEO Gil C. Quiniones. ""Congratulations to the inaugural cohort of the EV Readiness Program. We look forward to working together so that more Illinois residents can unlock the benefits of EVs safely and equitably.""Program participants will focus on policy development related to EV infrastructure, permitting, and safety, and support community engagement. Additionally, by building local capacity for EV integration, this program will help remove barriers that smaller communities may face in vying for state and federal funding to expand EV charging infrastructure – a key component to ensuring equitable access to EVs for residents across the region.Story continues""The EV Readiness Program is the first of its kind, and working together across the region is not new to us,"" said Kevin Burns, Caucus Environment Committee and Energy Subcommittee Chairman. ""Members of the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus have successfully collaborated to create the first Climate Action for the Chicago Region and to advance solar adoption in a similar cohort-based manner. ComEd is just the right partner to leverage our strengths as local government to achieve EV Readiness.""The first cohort selected by the Caucus includes a diverse mix of 16 communities across the region:AuroraCarol StreamChicagoDarienDeer ParkGenevaGlencoeHampshireHanover ParkKane CountyMaywoodOak ParkPoloRichton ParkSkokieUniversity ParkThrough the program, EV Readiness cohort members will follow a pathway toward EV Ready Bronze, Silver, or Gold designation, achieving status by taking action in several categories related to EV adoption and infrastructure.""Our aim is to make it faster, easier, and more affordable for our residents and businesses to install EV charging stations in our community,"" said City of Darien Mayor Joe Marchese. ""Darien has adopted the Greenest Region Compact, our region’s consensus sustainability pledge. The EV Readiness Program will help us achieve the sustainable transportation goals in the Compact.""""We are thrilled to be a part of the first EV Readiness Program cohort,"" said Village of Maywood Mayor Nathaniel George Booker. ""We hope our work to become EV ready will guide future investments in EVs and EV charging infrastructure in Maywood.""""We want to ensure we are prepared for the expected surge in electric vehicles in the coming years and funding opportunities that will go along with this,"" said Village of Richton Park Mayor Rick Reinbold. ""Joining the EV Readiness Program will help us do just that, and it will assist us in bringing the benefits of EV technology to more Richton Park residents, regardless of where they live or what their income level is.""Extensive input from over 300 individuals representing local governments, regional organizations, environmental organizations, and the EV industry helped inform the criteria for the EV Readiness Program. Members of the cohort begin work in early December and are expected to achieve ""EV Ready Community"" designation status within six to nine months. The Caucus expects a second cohort of municipalities and counties will start in 2023.The EV Readiness Program is the latest example of how ComEd is working to help communities unlock the benefits of EVs. To support broad-based EV growth in the region, ComEd has put forward a Beneficial Electrification proposal to the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) that would expand investments in fleet electrification, make-ready infrastructure and other customer resources to lower barriers to electrification across the region, including but not limited to EVs. The proposal is focused on areas most disproportionately impacted by pollution, and a ruling by the ICC is anticipated early next year.Additionally, to support residential customers with navigating EV options, ComEd has created an EV Toolkit – an all-in-one resource providing information and tips on available resources and rebates, rate plans and cost savings options, where to find charging stations, and more.For more information on the benefits of EVs or to receive support from ComEd on an electrification project, customers are encouraged to visit ComEd’s website.

291,913e8371-c75f-3fbe-b304-7d0a6bbd081c,HP,2022-12-01,Investors Will Want Helmerich & Payne's (NYSE:HP) Growth In ROCE To Persist,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-want-helmerich-paynes-nyse-112401682.html,1669893841,STORY,['HP'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So on that note, Helmerich &amp; Payne (NYSE:HP) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Helmerich &amp; Payne is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.0039 = US$16m ÷ (US$4.4b - US$395m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Helmerich &amp; Payne has an ROCE of 0.4%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Energy Services industry average of 7.0%. See our latest analysis for Helmerich &amp; Payne roceIn the above chart we have measured Helmerich &amp; Payne's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Helmerich &amp; Payne.The Trend Of ROCEIt's great to see that Helmerich &amp; Payne has started to generate some pre-tax earnings from prior investments. The company was generating losses five years ago, but now it's turned around, earning 0.4% which is no doubt a relief for some early shareholders. At first glance, it seems the business is getting more proficient at generating returns, because over the same period, the amount of capital employed has reduced by 35%. This could potentially mean that the company is selling some of its assets.The Key TakeawayIn a nutshell, we're pleased to see that Helmerich &amp; Payne has been able to generate higher returns from less capital. Since the stock has only returned 17% to shareholders over the last five years, the promising fundamentals may not be recognized yet by investors. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research.Story continuesOn a final note, we found  2 warning signs for Helmerich &amp; Payne (1 is a bit concerning)  you should be aware of.While Helmerich &amp; Payne may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

I met with teenage coders starting their own businesses, senior citizens getting connected to the internet for the first time, community-based leaders committed to bridging divides, and public officials doing what it takes to make a difference across the Golden State.And the best part of my tour? Sharing insights and learning from an inspiring group of people.In each community, I made it clear that, together with our community partners, Comcast is 100% committed to getting 100% of low-income households connected to high-speed internet through the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP).Right now, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to bridge the digital divide. And everyone I spoke with in California-politicians, activists, community leaders-is ready to seize that opportunity. I returned to the east coast more confident than ever that if we work together, we can get millions of more Americans connected to the internet's incredible resources.I joined Comcast over a year ago because of its decade-plus commitment to addressing digital equity. Looking ahead, I'm eager to build on that foundation through Project UP and our other innovative initiatives.Investing in CommunitiesUltimately, closing the digital divide starts at the local level. That's why we rely so heavily on our community partners. After all, to make an impact in a local neighborhood, you have to know the people who live there day-in and day-out.$275K Invested by Comcast in Saint Rest Baptist Church, Bitwise Impact, and El Concilio CaliforniaTo help do our part, in Stockton and Fresno, I was thrilled to announce that Comcast was giving a cumulative total of $275,000 to three separate entities: Saint Rest Baptist Church, Bitwise, and El Concilio California. These funds will help ensure our partners can do even more of the work they already do so well - helping students, seniors, adults, and families access the tools and resources they need to get connected to the internet and tap into their own unlimited possibilities.Story continuesFortunately, these men have tremendous resilience, impressive drive, and strong role models in their corners. It was inspiring to see what can be achieved through community mentorship and equitable access to the tools that unlock opportunity.Partnering with Local Leaders to Provide Free WiFiUnlocking opportunity is also the reason why we launched six new Lift Zones-one at Saint Rest Baptist Church in Fresno and five at several El Concilio locations across San Joaquin County. Our award-winning Lift Zone program offers free WiFi, which makes it possible for students, seniors, families, and adults to get online at their favorite community center where they can get technical help if they need it or just have a place they love go to where they can spend time exploring the internet.1,250 Lift Zones launched by ComcastSince 2020, Comcast's Lift Zones program has enabled nearly six million free WiFi user sessions nationwide. And in California, I got to announce that we have exceeded our expanded goal of launching 1,250 Lift Zones all across the country. To celebrate this milestone and amazing accomplishments by our partners, we brought together more than 100 executives, program directors, community leaders, public officials, and other key stakeholders from around the Golden State for our first ever Digital Equity Summit.At the summit, I met Eduardo Gonzalez of the Office of Community &amp; Economic Development, California State University, Fresno. In that role, he leads an innovative digital navigator program at Fresno State University. After speaking with him, I came away convinced that if we work together, we'll continue to come up with bold solutions for getting more people online, especially if we train effective digital navigators who can go and reach out into their respective communities.Essential ToolsThe late American icon Congressman John Lewis called internet access, ""the civil rights issue of the 21st century."" What I'm confident he meant is that, like voting, the internet is a necessary condition for full participation in our society. It's an essential tool for seeking knowledge and opportunity, for staying informed and involved, for participating in the democratic process, for making voices heard and for completing simple daily tasks faster and easier, and for achieving economic mobility and success.But to reap the full benefits of internet access, people need more than just a connection. They need the right devices-devices that allow them to do more than text and check sports scores. Every household, at a minimum, should have a computer. That's why, one of my favorite parts of these community events are the laptop giveaways.440+ Laptops donated to The Hidden Genius Project, Saint Rest Baptist Church, and El Concilio AcademyAnd this past week didn't disappoint. Comcast surprised more than 440 students, seniors, and families at The Hidden Genius Project, Saint Rest Baptist Church, and El Concilio Academy with free laptops. I gave devices to students young and old, many of whom told me this is the first computer they have ever had that they could call their own. The joy on their faces said it all. I knew I wasn't just handing them a laptop-but a powerful tool. A tool with the potential to level the playing field, open doors to knowledge and opportunities, and change lives.I'm truly grateful for the time spent in California and immensely proud to work with trailblazing leaders like Mayor Kevin Lincoln of Stockton; Deputy Mayor Matthew Grundy of Fresno; Aumijo Gomes, Deputy Director, Strategic Initiative, City of San Francisco Department of Children, Youth and their Families; Clay Garner, Chief Innovation Officer, City of San Jose; Brandon Nicholson, Co-founder of The Hidden Genius Project; D.J. Criner, Pastor of Saint Rest Baptist Church; Irma Olguin Jr., Co-founder and CEO of Bitwise; Jose R. Rodriguez, President &amp; CEO of El Concilio California; Gloria Corral, President &amp; CEO, Parent Institute for Quality Education; Eduardo Gonzalez, Office of Community &amp; Economic Development, California State University, Fresno and many others. Their commitment to generating real change makes us proud to be their partners.California is famous for its sunshine, and my trip to the state was indeed filled with light-and with hope for a future of unlimited possibilities.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Comcast Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Comcast CorporationWebsite: http://www.comcastcorporation.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Comcast CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/729509/Partnering-UP-to-Close-the-Digital-Divide-in-California]"

This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast Comcast Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP, Daniel Murdock, for US$397k worth of shares, at about US$44.50 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$35.48). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it. Daniel Murdock was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider Ownership Of ComcastAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Comcast insiders own about US$1.4b worth of shares (which is 0.9% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Comcast Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Comcast shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Comcast insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that Comcast has 3 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.Story continuesIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Humans have been conducting trade since the old ages, and with trade comes the risk of losing out in case of a bad deal. Some of the earliest examples of insulation against such deals come from the time of Hammurabi, the sixth king of the Old Babylonian Empire. Hammurabi's famous codex mandated that shippers only pay the principal of their loan to a creditor if their consignment was lost due to a natural disaster.Since then, the insurance industry has evolved and now uses complex mathematical and statistical models to determine what an individual must pay and what policies to offer. One insurance segment is life insurance, which protects families from financial difficulties in case a key member passes away. This industry is one of the largest in the world, according to research from Research Reports World. The firm estimates that the global life insurance sector was worth a whopping $2.8 trillion in 2021, and from then until 2027, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.99% to sit an estimated $3.75 trillion.Today's piece will focus on the largest American life insurance providers, and some of the top firms in it are MetLife, Inc.

SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is a global leader in enterprise software solutions and has been a major player in the software-as-a-service (SaaS) and cloud computing markets for years. The company has a strong presence in the enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) software markets and its solutions are used by businesses of all sizes around the world. The company has consistently reported strong financial results, with revenue and earnings growth in recent years driven by strong demand for its solutions and services. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) has also invested heavily in developing its cloud-based solutions and services. This has helped to drive growth and attract new customers. The company is also investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies, which it believes will be key to its future success.SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) holds a strong cash position and has free cash flows of EUR 3.87 billion. The company is well-positioned to grow its market share in the cloud computing industry and is among the best cloud computing stocks to buy now. On November 21, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow upgraded SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) to Overweight from Equal Weight and reiterated his $136 price target on the stock.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 17 hedge funds were long SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) and held stakes worth $1.16 billion in the company.

ERP is a software category that is particularly critical to business functions, and, therefore, has high retention rates even in times of economic stress. For the past several years, SAP has been going through several transitions, including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters, we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed, and the result should be a faster-growing, more consistent, higher margin, and more advantaged business. As investment costs from these transition programs wane, and as the benefits of higher growth continue, we expect that earnings will grow at a double-digit rate from next year (2023) onwards. In light of this, we believe the valuation is very attractive for longterm investors.”In addition to SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), big-tech companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are well-positioned to capitalize on the secular growth trends in the global cloud computing market.14.

While we think process automation is a growing market, in a slowing macro environment single solutions may be more vulnerable than the platform solutions of software providers who can bundle products to meet a wide range of needs. In addition, the company has a material component of sales sourced in Europe where the economy is more vulnerable.”13.

Its shares fell because of softening demand from its small- and medium-sized customers, the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and a deceleration in its marketing related offerings. In addition, a well-communicated reduction in potential users for Veeva’s CRM platform, because of sales headcount reductions among certain life sciences customers, implied a possible deceleration in growth rates. Despite these challenges, we see increasing traction of its newer products among large pharmaceutical customers that we expect to generate significant profitable growth in the coming years.”11.

FIVN is well-positioned as contact centers transition to the cloud with high customer retention (120% last quarter), the doubling of its strategic sales team over the past year, and new partnerships, including with AT&amp;T, CDW and Microsoft. We believe the company can grow its top-line at more than 20% annually, improve its 60% gross margins, and expand EBITDA margin to more than 20%, all of which should lead to 30%+ EPS growth for the foreseeable future. The company should turn FCF-positive this year and continue to expand its FCF growth in the years to come given its highly capital efficient business model.”10.

Over the years, JIRA has become the industry standard for developer collaboration tools, which has driven Atlassian to benefit from durable growth, compounding revenues over 30% for nine consecutive years with free cash flows compounding at higher rates. Atlassian’s opportunity is underpinned by three large markets (DevOps, IT service management, and Work Management) with product leadership in each area, and a disruptive go-to-market model. Atlassian’s products are easy to use and are still primarily purchased online via a highly efficient self-service model, driving attractive unit economics with substantially lower-than-industry Sales and Marketing spend at approximately 15% of revenues (versus 30% to 40% for peers), enabling it to invest more in R&amp;D and powering disruptive pricing dynamics (where customers get similar or better functionality for a much lower price)Additionally, Atlassian began its business model shift to the cloud in earnest in fiscal year 2020 which has driven accelerating subscription growth of over 50% for the last five quarters (with only about 10 points of growth due to cloud migrations). The model transition is expected to mature in fiscal year 2024, which should unlock smoother long-term cross selling and up selling activity, opening an opportunity to drive up average customer spending by six to eight times over time. While seat expansion remains the most important revenue growth driver in the near term, the recently introduced Enterprise and Premium offerings, priced at a one and a half to three times compared to the standard package, are also starting to contribute, and are expected become even more prominent with the cloud transition…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. But Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 39% over five years, which is below the market return. The last year has been disappointing, with the stock price down 32% in that time.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Micron Technology There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Micron Technology achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 11% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 7% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company. The reasonably low P/E ratio of 7.21 also suggests market apprehension.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Micron Technology has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 14% in the twelve months, Micron Technology shareholders did even worse, losing 32% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 7%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

If you want to read about some more safe stocks, go directly to 5 Safe Stocks to Buy For Beginner Investors.The collapse of the cryptocurrency market in the past few months has highlighted the perils of investing in speculative assets, especially to retail investors or beginners who had only just begun their investing careers and now face the daunting prospect of losing a vast portion of their wealth due to the slowing macro environment. In addition to crypto, other riskier growth stocks are also down. The NASDAQ Composite, made up primarily of tech-heavy firms, is down close to 30% year-to-date, as of November 28. However, the shares of established tech giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) have withstood the macro pressures better than feared. This resilience has underlined the importance of balancing portfolios with safe stocks that offer reliable dividend payouts and have pricing power to protect against inflation. Beginner investors, who have gained in prominence on Wall Street since the GameStop short squeeze saga of early 2021, should study the investing habits of titans like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, or elite hedge funds, to understand these concepts better. Our MethodologyThe companies that have established business models that have demonstrated historical resilience against inflationary headwinds were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.14 Safe Stocks to Buy For Beginner InvestorsPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashSafe Stocks to Buy For Beginner Investors14. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59  The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a beverage company that manufactures, markets, and sells various non-alcoholic beverages worldwide. It is one of the best safe stocks to buy for beginners. On November 8, Coca-Cola raised its full-year profit forecast, as increasing prices help the company to keep up the fizz for its sodas. On November 4, Coca-Cola announced the launch of the iced tea category in Pakistan with its billion-dollar ready-to-drink brand, Fuze Tea. The firm has been paying a dividend to shareholders for the past sixty years consistently, an achievement that only a handful of companies can boast of on the US market. Story continuesOn October 26, UBS analyst Peter Grom maintained a Buy rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stock and raised the price target to $68 from $63, noting that the company's third quarter earnings beat was impressive as its organic growth more than offset currency headwinds.    At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 59 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $25 billion in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 60 in the preceding quarter worth $28.4 billion. Just like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the safest stocks to buy for beginner investors according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”13. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66     Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) engages in integrated energy and chemical operations worldwide. On November 8, Chevron New Energies, a unit of Chevron, announced a collaboration with JERA, a Japanese energy giant, on the multiple lower carbon opportunities in the US and Asia Pacific region. The companies will collaborate on opportunities including carbon capture, production, storage and utilization. The firm is a reliable name in the energy sector with a dividend history stretching back thirty-five years. On October 31, investment advisory Cowen maintained an Outperform rating on Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock and raised the price target to $185 from $160. Analyst Charles Ryhee issued the ratings update. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 66 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $27 billion in Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), compared to 59 in the preceding quarter worth $26 billion.In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Diamond Hill, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Other top contributors in Q1 included multinational energy company Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX). The company benefited from increased energy demand as COVID-related economic restrictions eased in tandem with concerns regarding supply interruptions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”12. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74   Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) designs, manufactures and sells memory and storage products worldwide.  It is one of the top safe stocks to buy for beginners. On November 1, Micron Technology unveiled that it has started shipping samples of its most advanced DRAM chip based on the LPDDR5X, low power double data rate 5X, to smartphone makers to test out. The new DRAM chip is made of 1-beta technology. The company operates in the semiconductor space that provides key tech to the gaming, automobile, defense, and other industries. It is expected that the demand for chips will continue to rise in the coming years. On October 13, investment advisory Loop Capital initiated coverage of Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) with a Buy rating and a $70 price target. Analyst Charles Park issued the ratings update. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 74 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.5 billion in Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), compared to 69 in the preceding quarter worth $2.2 billion.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Meridian Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”11. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75    Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) explores for and produces crude oil and natural gas. On November 7, Exxon Mobil said that it is expected to lose $2 billion when it sells an oil field off the coast of California, where an oil spill halted operation in 2015.

Here is what the fund said:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”10. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) researches and develops, manufactures, and sells various products in the healthcare field.  It is one of the premier safe stocks to buy for beginners.

Here is what the fund said:“Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is currently our largest position and a long-standing holding. The majority of the group’s sales come from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ make and spends a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopaedics. The rest of that dollar in sales comes from sales of JNJ’s consumer brands such as Listerine mouthwash, Nicorette nicotine tablets and Neutrogena cosmetics (…read more)9. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88   Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles, and energy generation and storage systems. On November 8, Tesla announced that it has raised insurance incentives for car orders in China placed before November 30, but reduced them for orders made next month, to urge customers to make orders earlier. As the demand for EVs rises across the next few decades, Tesla, as one of the largest EV firms, is expected to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of this boom. On October 24, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas maintained an Overweight rating on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock and lowered the price target to $330 from $350, noting that the company reported strong third quarter results.   At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 88 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $7.4 billion in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), compared to 73 in the preceding quarter worth $7.2 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In 2014, before we began to invest in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), I called Roger to ask whether he thought Elon Musk’s electric car business would succeed. I did not believe that Roger, an owner of dealerships that sell cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) would likely have a favorable opinion of Tesla’s prospects. That was principally for two reasons:First, automobile manufacturing and distribution is unusually complicated, capital intensive, and highly regulated, which makes profitability problematic;second, cars with ICE motors require extensive annual maintenance, and dealer services revenues, not profits from automobile sales, are the most important contributor to profits of perpetual licensed ICE car dealerships.Penske Automotive Group is principally an ICE car dealer. Since electric cars are powered by batteries and need little service, franchised dealerships are incented to sell ICE, not EV automobiles. Further, Roger had been a long-term director of General Motors. General Motors’ ICE automobile business would be disrupted if Tesla were successful. (click here to read more…)8.

Here is what the fund said:“At the company-specific level, there was a broad correction across the entire portfolio. While four of our holdings contributed to performance, the contribution to absolute returns was less than 100bps combined, as unfortunately none of them was large enough to move the needle. We had 16 investments detracting over 100bps each with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), our second largest detractor, costing the Fund 254bps.NVIDIA’s stock was hit even harder, down 44.4%, impacted by concerns over the health of the consumer, dramatic declines in crypto, and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Despite the sell-off and the increased near-term volatility in its gaming business, NVIDIA’s revenues grew 46% year-over-year with 48% operating margins, driven by continued strength in its data center business as companies across industries adopt AI and ML…(read more)7.

Their products are a key element in driving the digital transformation nearly every large company is undergoing. At the recent JP Morgan investor day, CEO Jamie Dimon explained that while the company could reduce expenses if needed should the economy slow, their spending on digital transformation would continue as this spending was critical to the company managing costs and maximizing revenue over time. As an example of this type of spending, Dimon specifically pointed to ServiceNow, calling out that the company’s products now oversaw the single largest collection of JP Morgan data and highlighted that working with them had saved JP Morgan $50 million over the past few years.

The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Safe Stocks to Buy For Beginner Investors. Suggested Articles:12 Best Nancy Pelosi Stocks To BuyTop 10 Green Hydrogen Companies in the World15 Best Self-Driving Car Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

In total, KFC and its franchisees will provide nearly 70,000 meals to kids and families in need this holiday season, making stops in three U.S. cities.In the spirit of giving this holiday season, Kentucky Fried Chicken® is hitting the road with longtime partner Blessings in a Backpack to feed families in need with the KFC Sharemobile, a holiday-edition charitable food truck. For more information on the KFC Sharemobile and to donate to Blessings in a Backpack, visit kfc.com/kfcsharemobile.The KFC Sharemobile will deliver finger lickin' good family meals to families starting December 5 in communities that have been recently affected by food insecurity or other hardships that make it more difficult for families to put food on the table this holiday:Chicago: The KFC Sharemobile is headed to the Windy City, where the pandemic has amplified food insecurity and exacerbated the many hurdles that families face while attempting to put food on the table.Orlando: The recent hurricane season devastated communities throughout Florida and displaced hundreds of families, so KFC will be visiting an elementary school in Orlando to provide meals that help bridge the need gap.Houston: Lastly, the KFC Sharemobile's tour will culminate in Houston as many are having a hard time meeting basic needs following several recent events, including an unprecedented winter storm that shut down power, the pandemic and busy hurricane seasons that greatly affected the city the last few years.At each of these stops, KFC will be surprising families who have faced additional difficulties this year with special gifts targeted to address specific needs identified by their respective schools, to make their holiday season a little brighter.""Sharing a meal with family or friends is a special part of the holidays,"" said Nick Chavez, CMO, KFC U.S. ""Alongside our franchisees, we wanted to make that possible for even more families this holiday season.

If you want to see more of the best defensive stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Defensive Stocks to Buy Now.Defensive stocks are stocks that generate relatively stable performances regardless of the market cycle. Defensive stocks generally don't fall as much as the overall market in recessionary times and they might not do as well as the market in more expansionary times. Examples of defensive stocks are leading consumer staples that produce or sell necessities that are in demand throughout the market cycle. Other defensive stocks have very wide moats and substantial competitive advantages that allow them to largely maintain their financial performance during recessions.Given their relatively stable performances, many defensive stocks pay dividends that are pretty consistent. Many of the same defensive stocks have also raised their annual dividends for many consecutive years. If interested also check out 12 Best Consumer Staple Stocks.It should be noted that defensive stocks may not always remain defensive stocks because industries and company management constantly change. If an industry undergoes secular decline, defensive stocks can underperform. Similarly if a formerly defensive company's management decided to overpay for an acquisition, the stock might not do well either.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.2022 has been a challenging year in the market as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times to fight inflation. Although October's core inflation data has shown some positive signs that inflation could be peaking, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard recently said he thought interest rates might need to rise to 5% or higher and stay there until into 2024 before the U.S. central bank can begin to normalize its monetary policy again.Story continuesGiven the interest rate increases and the expected economic slowdown in 2023, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 17.5% year to date and the NASDAQ has declined 30.6% year to date.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Defensive Stocks to Buy Now, we took 12 stocks that have defensive qualities that have outperformed the S&amp;P 500's decline of 17.5% year to date in 2022.We then ranked the 12 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q3 2022.12 Best Defensive Stocks to Buy Now12.

(NYSE:PLD) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-market-wrong-prologis-inc-140038511.html,1669816838,STORY,['PLD'],"[With its stock down 8.6% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Prologis (NYSE:PLD). But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Prologis'  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Prologis How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Prologis is:11% = US$4.2b ÷ US$40b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.11 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Prologis' Earnings Growth And 11% ROEAt first glance, Prologis seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 6.9%. Probably as a result of this, Prologis was able to see a decent growth of 17% over the last five years.As a next step, we compared Prologis' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 12%.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is PLD fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Prologis Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Prologis has a high three-year median payout ratio of 51%. This means that it has only 49% of its income left to reinvest into its business. However, it's not unusual to see a REIT with such a high payout ratio mainly due to statutory requirements. Despite this, the company's earnings grew moderately as we saw above.Besides, Prologis has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 58%. Regardless, Prologis' ROE is speculated to decline to 6.6% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Prologis' performance. Especially the high ROE, Which has contributed to the impressive growth seen in earnings. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

Recent share price weakness provided an opportunity for us to add it to our large-cap concentrated portfolio at an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Caterpillar stands to benefit from increased capital investment supported by a healthier/recovering end market environment, particularly in construction and mining.”8. Carvana Co.

(NYSE:CVNA) with 6.8 million shares worth more than $138.6 million. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Steel City Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“As I write, Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA), a long-time short, is circling the drain. After reporting earnings, shares have been roughly cut in half while the company’s bonds are now priced anywhere from 35- to 45 cents on the dollar, with yields ranging from 25% to 40%. While the shares already experienced a steep decline during the past year, the post-earnings sell-off appears to reflect investors finally acknowledging the company’s near-term liquidity issues. Raising capital – debt or equity – seems unlikely, if not impossible. Bulls had been holding on to the hope CVNA would meet its stated “goal” of generating “significantly positive EBITDA in FY 2023,” but management walked back that aspiration last week. I always thought the word “goal” reflected squishy language that never carried the same weight as “guidance” and drew conclusions accordingly. The difference is much the same as me telling my wife I have a “goal” of having washboard abs vs. “guidance” that I will have them by swimsuit season. The language was deliberate (and probably highly lawyered), and in my estimation, reflected an effort to give bulls something to cling on to without the company exposing itself to a lawsuit when they (inevitably) missed.”7. Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48 Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) owns, operates and leases more than 40,000 cell towers and approximately 80,000 route miles of fiber supporting small cells and fiber solutions across every major US market.

(NYSE:CCI) stock and lowered the price target to $150 from $202, noting that the company's third-quarter results were in-line and set a more conservative target multiple given the macroeconomic backdrop.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Camas, Washington-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) with 3 million shares worth more than $434 million. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“U.S. communications company Crown Castle International (NYSE:CCI) was the largest detractor from quarterly performance. Crown Castle is the leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure in the U.S. with a portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers. The stock underperformed as, driven by rising interest rates, investors rotated away from defensive into more value-oriented sectors. Communications infrastructure remains attractive, however, as companies continue to deploy greater capital spending to support the strong tailwinds from 5G.”6. United Parcel Service, Inc.

(NYSE:UPS) has suffered a decline of just over 13% year to date.United Parcel Service Is Fundamentally StrongThis is a better performance than the S&amp;P 500 Index, which has lost more than 17%, or the industrial sector, which is lower by almost 16%.UPS has slightly outperformed its own sector and the broad market averages because its business performance in recent quarters has been solid, especially coming off the high growth rates seen during the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with UPS. Click here to check it out. UPS 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of UPSPeter Lynch Chart of UPSFollowing the decline in price, are shares offering enough potential return to justify investment in the stock? This analysis will examine the company in further detail to answer that question.Takeaways from recent earnings results UPS reported third-quarter earnings results on Oct. 25 that were mixed. Revenue grew 4.2% to $24.2 billion, but this was $161 million less than the market had expected. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.99 compared to $2.71 in the prior year and was 14 cents above estimates.While revenue did miss, the quarter showed continued strength in the overall business. For example, third-quarter revenue growth for 2021 and 2020 was 9.2% and 16%. The overall growth rates have slowed, but UPS has not seen a drop since the Covid-19-fueled demand of 2020. Customers continue to use the companys services at a higher rate.UPS is also able to charge more per piece that it ships. Consider the companys largest segment, its U.S. Domestic business. Revenue grew 8.2% to $15.4 billion for the quarter. Average daily volume did fall 1.5% for the period, but a nearly 10% increase in revenue per piece more than offset the small fall in demand. Pricing likely led to fewer pieces being shipped, but not very much as demand hardly fell.One area of note is the decline in business-to-consumer average daily volume of 2.2% year over year compared to just a 0.5% decrease in business-to-business.Story continuesThat said, the holiday shopping season should be an opportunity for an improvement in volumes. According to Adobe Analytics, Black Friday sales reached a record $9.1 billion in the U.S. Even without inflation, sales still grew compared to the prior year. Sales for Cyber Monday grew 5.8% to a new record $11.3 billion. In short, the holiday shopping season will keep UPS, and its peers, busy over the next month or so as demand for goods is not being impacted by the higher cost per piece.The international segment had revenue growth of 1.7% to $4.8 billion, driven by revenue per piece increasing 6.4%. Demand in this segment was lower as volume fell more than 5%. Currency exchange rates also negatively impacted results.Revenue for Supply Chain Solutions was 6.3% lower to just under $4 billion. Air and ocean freight volumes fell, but the companys logistics and health care businesses partially offset this weakness.The increase in pricing is also positively benefiting margins. The companys adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 13%, with all three segments showing improvements.Following quarterly results, UPS reaffirmed its previously issued guidance for 2022. The company expects revenue of $102 billion, which would be a 5% increase from the prior year.According to Morningstar Inc. (NASDAQ:MORN), analysts expect UPS to produce earnings per share of $12.88 in 2022, which would be 6.2% higher than results in 2021.Impressive rankings versus peersUPS has steadily increased revenue and, to a large extent, net income for much of the last decade.United Parcel Service Is Fundamentally StrongIf the company delivers on expected numbers for this year, that trend will continue.Looking at a number of metrics, UPS is clearly a leader in its industry. This is clear in its GF Score, which is a strong 93 out of 100 and suggests that the company has the potential for high outperformance. This score reflects strong ratings for profitability, growth and momentum and middling scores on value and financial strength.United Parcel Service Is Fundamentally StrongThe companys best category is profitability, where UPS has a near-perfect score of 9 out of 10. The company is near the end high of its peer group on nearly every metric, including return on assets, return on equity and return on invested capital, showing that UPS has been highly successful at generating profit over long periods of time. All three scores are near the best levels of the last decade for the company. UPS has been profitable every year for the last 10 years, putting the company ahead of 99.9% of its peer group.Financial strength is UPSs weakest area, but still scores a solid 6 out of 10. Debt levels have increased over the years, which have led to cash-to-debt and debt-to-equity ratios that have fallen below peers. The good news is that bankruptcy seems highly unlikely. The Piotroski F-Score of 8 out 9 shows that UPS is on a very stable financial footing and the Altman Z-score of 4.5 means that the company is not headed toward bankruptcy. Returning to the theme of profit generation, UPS also has a very strong ROIC of 21.7%, which is well ahead of its weighted average cost of capital of 7%.Valuation analysisUsing analysts estimates for the year, shares of UPS are trading at 14.4 times forward earnings estimates. This compares favorably to the price-earnings ratio of 17.4 that UPS averaged for the last decade, according to Value Line, suggesting a sizeable return from current levels if the stock were to revert closer to its long-term average valuation.The GF Value chart shows a more conservative potential return.United Parcel Service Is Fundamentally StrongUPS has a price-to-GF Value ratio of 0.92, suggesting a potential return of 9.2% from the current share price. This would be before factoring in the dividend, which has been raised for 13 consecutive years, with a most recent increase of 49%. Shares yield 3.3%, nearly twice the average yield of 1.7% for the S&amp;P 500 Index.Final thoughtsThe most recent quarterly results show UPS continues to perform well. Volume declines are present, but are still low and more than offset by price increases. The holiday shopping season should also provide a tailwind to the current quarter as well.UPS has several other factors working in its favor as the company scores very well on many different metrics and has a long history of growth. Shares are also trading well below the historical average valuation.The decline in share price has led to shares trading at a solid discount to intrinsic value, which could, in combination with the dividend yield, lead to double-digit total returns. This could make UPS a name investors might want to add to their watchlist.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"
316,ba39a65d-bcd3-3152-ad42-6ae02d602b47,UPS,2022-12-01,Coca-Cola and Adidas have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-adidas-highlighted-zacks-133601219.html,1669815361,STORY,"['ADS.DE', 'UPS', 'KOF']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – November 30, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Coca-Cola FEMSA KOF as the Bull of the Day and Adidas AG ADDYY as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on United Parcel Service's UPS, Covenant Logistics CVLG and Ryder System R.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Coca-Cola FEMSA, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), has bucked the market's downtrend this year, displaying resilience in a difficult environment. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to weather bear markets so gracefully. KOF continues to benefit from strong demand for its suite of beverage products, with the stock currently trading near 52-week highs.KOF is part of the Zacks Beverages – Soft Drinks industry group, which ranks in the top 35% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock's price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Because this group is ranked in the top half of all industries, we expect it to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. By focusing on leading stocks within the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries, we can dramatically improve our stock-picking success.Company DescriptionCoca-Cola FEMSA is a franchise bottler that produces, markets, and sells Coca-Cola trademark beverages. A subsidiary of Fomento Económico Mexicano and based out of Mexico City, the company offers sparkling beverages, juice drinks, coffee, teas, sports and energy drinks, and plant-based items.KOF provides its products through supermarkets, discount and convenience stores, restaurants, bars, as well as theaters and stadiums. The company also distributes and sells Heineken beer products in its Brazilian territories.Earnings Trends and Future Estimates The beverage company has surpassed earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 33.63% over that timeframe. Coca-Cola FEMSA most recently reported Q3 EPS last month of $1.03/share, a +30.38% surprise over the $0.79 consensus estimate. Sales of $2.82 billion also exceeded projections.Story continuesAnalysts are bullish and have been revising future estimates upward as of late. Looking ahead to next year, EPS estimates have increased 7.4% in the past 60 days. The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $4.21/share, reflecting potential growth of 7.4% versus the $3.92/share projection for this year. Revenues are anticipated to climb 3.63% to $11.45 billion.Let's Get TechnicalKOF shares have advanced nearly 50% in the past year. The stock has shown immunity to the year's volatility while the market continues to hover in a deep correction. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.The stock has been consistently making a series of higher highs. With both strong fundamentals and technicals, KOF is poised to continue its outperformance.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, KOF has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and KOF continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run.Bottom LineIn addition to rising earnings estimates for this top-ranked stock, KOF pays a healthy $2.50 (3.67%) dividend and has a market capitalization of $114.4 billion. Robust fundamentals combined with a strong technical trend certainly justify adding shares to the mix.Backed by a leading industry group and robust history of earnings beats, it's not difficult to see why this company is a compelling investment. This market winner has broken out to the upside this year and appears primed to continue the bullish run.Bear of the Day:Adidas AG is a global designer, developer, and marketer of athletic and sports lifestyle products. The company offers footwear, apparel, and accessories under the Adidas brand. ADDYY sells its products through approximately 2,200 retail stores; mono-branded franchise stores; and wholesale and e-commerce channels. Adidas was founded in 1920 and is based out of Germany.The sportswear company has recently been in the news after breaking ties with celebrity Kanye West. Adidas has launched an investigation into allegedly inappropriate behavior by Kanye while the company was working with the musician to develop and sell the Yeezy sneaker line. The end of the partnership has left Adidas facing a large revenue shortfall as well as internal complaints about the celebrity's behavior.The Zacks RundownAdidas has been severely underperforming the market over the past year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock, ADDYY experienced a climax top in August of last year and has been in a price downtrend ever since. The stock has hit a series of 52-week lows throughout most of this year and represents a compelling short opportunity given a temporary move higher amid general market strength.ADDYY is a component of the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry group, which currently ranks in the bottom 8% out of approximately 250 industries. Because this industry is ranked in the bottom half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect it to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.Candidates in the bottom half of industry groups can often represent solid potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in poor-performing industries, their industry association serves as a headwind for any potential rallies.Despite the stock's poor performance this year, ADDYY is still relatively overvalued, irrespective of the valuation metric used.Recent Earnings Miss and Deteriorating ForecastsADDYY fell well short of earnings estimates in the previous quarter. The footwear giant reported Q3 EPS earlier this month of $0.17/share, missing the $0.47 consensus estimate by -63.83%. A wide miss of this nature is troubling and speaks to uncertainty regarding the upcoming quarters. Last year, Adidas reported earnings in the third quarter of $1.38/share on revenues of $6.78 billion. This is the type of alarming, negative trend that the bears like to see.Analysts have been slashing earnings estimates downward as of late. For the current quarter, estimates have been reduced -785.71% over the past 60 days. The Q4 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at a loss of -$1.44/share, translating to a -523.53% earnings regression relative to the same quarter last year. Sales are expected to fall -1.61% to $5.78 billion.Technical OutlookAs illustrated below, ADDYY is in a sustained downtrend. While not the most accurate indicator, ADDYY has also experienced what is known as a 'death cross,' wherein the stock's 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. ADDYY would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. The stock has fallen more than 55% this year alone.Final ThoughtsA deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to print new highs anytime soon. The fact that ADDYY is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. The recent earnings miss along with falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock's downtrend.Our Zacks Style Scores depict a weakening outlook for this stock, as ADDYY is rated a second-worst 'D' in our Value category and 'C' for our overall VGM score. Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of an overvalued ADDYY until the situation shows major signs of improvement.Additional content:UPS Strong on Dividends and Buybacks, Despite Cost ChallengesUnited Parcel Service's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks vouch for its solid financial footing. However, high operating costs, mainly due to elevated fuel expenses, are restricting bottom-line growth. Currently, UPS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Delving DeeperUPS' strong free cash flow generating ability pleases us and supports its shareholder-friendly activities. In the first nine months of 2022, UPS generated a free cash flow of $8,472 million, paid out dividends worth $3.8 billion and repurchased shares of $2.2 billion. UPS aims to reward its shareholders with $8.2 billion in 2022 through dividends ($5.2 billion) and share buybacks ($3 billion).Even though demand for online shopping slowed down from the pandemic peak with the reopening of the economy, the figures are higher than the pre-pandemic levels. To meet the demand swell in the holiday season, UPS added more than 100,000 seasonal workers throughout the United States. Additional workers are needed to ensure a repeat of UPS' buoyant performance witnessed last year with respect to timeliness. Therefore, the decision to hire extra hands to meet the anticipated surge in package delivery demand seems prudent. A strong performance during the holiday season is likely to boost the UPS stock.However, higher operating expenses are concerning. For example, operating costs escalated 9.7% in 2021. Due to the 66.4% jump in fuel expenses, operating costs increased 4.6% in the first nine months of 2022. Due to the persistence of high fuel costs, operating expenses are likely to soar in fourth-quarter 2022 as well.Rising capital expenses further add to its woes. UPS now expects current-year capital expenditures to be $5 billion, well above the 2021 levels. The increased capex guidance, albeit aimed at long-term benefits, may dent the current-year profit margins.In third-quarter 2022, shipping volumes dipped 2.1% year over year to 22.9 million. The contraction in the volume of packages shipped indicates weakening demand due to the economic slowdown. The metric had declined in the June quarter as well. This downside in shipping volumes due to softening demand is an added concern.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks within the broader Transportation sector are as follows:Covenant Logistics: CVLG offers a portfolio of transportation and logistics services, including asset-based expedited, dedicated and irregular route truckload capacity, besides asset-light warehousing, transportation management and freight brokerage capability.The gradually improving freight market scenario is a tailwind to Covenant. CVLG's cost-control efforts are appreciated as well. CVLG currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The stock has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings being revised 10.1% upward over the past 60 days.You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Ryder System : Based in Miami, FL, Ryder provides integrated logistics and transportation solutions. With improved economic and freight market conditions, R is benefiting from higher rental revenues owing to strong demand and favorable pricing. R's acquisitions of Whiplash and Midwest Warehouse &amp; Distribution System expand its e-commerce fulfillment network and boost multi-client warehousing capabilities.

However, Mondelez is seeing input cost inflation, especially for energy, transportation, packaging, wheat, dairy and edible oils.It is also navigating through supply-chain bottlenecks due to labor shortages at third parties. Management’s guidance for 2022 reflects anticipation of the elevated cost of goods sold inflation, the timing impact of extra pricing actions and the impacts of the Ukraine war.(You can read the full research report on Mondelez here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of EOG Resources have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry over the past year (+65.5% vs. +49.1%).

327,5ccf3dfe-9672-3253-802c-17111cd9b3bf,OXY,2022-12-01,Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-stock-portfolio-top-134653882.html,1669816013,STORY,"['BAC', 'TSM', 'ATVI', 'OXY', 'KO', 'AAPL', 'KHC']","[In this article we’ll dive into the Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks. For the Oracle of Omaha’s top stock picks, check out the Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) are some of the gigantic stock positions owned by billionaire investing icon Warren Buffett’s holding company Berkshire Hathaway.92-year-old investing legend Warren Buffett is still going strong as the CEO of his $700 billion holding company Berkshire Hathaway, which he’s helmed for close to six decades. During that time, Berkshire Hathaway has generated brain-melting returns of over 3.64 million percent, meaning $100 invested in Berkshire in 1965 would’ve turned into more than $3.64 million today.Not surprisingly, Buffett himself is one of the richest men in the world, with a personal fortune estimated by Forbes at $110 billion, making him the sixth-richest person in the world. Buffett could in fact be significantly wealthier than that, but has donated nearly $50 billion worth of his own shares in Berkshire Hathaway to various charitable causes over the years, including to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, which is managed by Michael Larson.While Buffett maintains the same buy-and-hold investment philosophy that has underpinned much of his success over the years, his targets have changed considerably. Tech stocks now dominate Berkshire’s 13F portfolio, accounting for 44% of its 13F AUM. One tech stock in particular accounts for the lion’s share of that amount, while Buffett also made another notable tech addition to Berkshire’s portfolio during Q3.The bulk of Berkshire’s remaining 13F assets are distributed primarily between three other sectors, energy, finance, and consumer staples, the latter two of which dominated Berkshire’s sector allocation for many years, accounting for as much as 85% of the holding company’s assets. In the case of energy stocks, Berkshire has invested more heavily in them this year than it has in decades, with its prior noteworthy forays into the sector coming in 2008 and 2013.Story continuesUnlike several other prominent money managers, Buffett hasn’t shown any bearishness in the current economic environment when it comes to pulling Berkshire’s assets out of the equities market. The firm’s 13F AUM rose slightly in Q1 and did decline by about 17% during Q2, but that was about in line with the market’s overall performance.The firm’s 13F AUM was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter during Q3, dipping slightly to $296 billion. Berkshire added three new holdings to its 13F portfolio during the quarter, while selling off one former position. Even then, the latter move was due to the company in question, STORE Capital Corporation (NYSE:STOR), being acquired during the quarter.Now then, let’s take a look at the top ten stock picks from Warren Buffett’s 13F portfolio as of September 30, which the investing legend has hundreds of billions of dollars riding on.Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock PicksOur MethodologyThe following data is gathered from Berkshire Hathaway’s latest 13F filing with the SEC. We follow hedge funds like Berkshire Hathaway because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q3 2022 reporting period.Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks10. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) Value of Berkshire Hathaway‘s 13F Position: $4.12 Billion Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 90 Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) are some of the long-term cornerstones of Warren Buffett’s portfolio. One of the newest additions to his portfolio is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), which Buffett’s holding company bought over 60 million shares of during Q3. TSM shares jumped by 10.5% on November 15 following the reveal of Buffett’s position.Buffett wasn’t the only hedge fund manager buying shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) during Q3, as the stock ended the quarter at an all-time high in terms of hedge fund ownership among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates and Stanley Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Capital are two other prominent investors that took stakes in TSM during the quarter.Given Buffett’s huge stake in Apple, it’s perhaps somewhat overdue that he also invests in one of the company’s primary chip suppliers in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), which generates about a quarter of its revenue from Apple. TSM’s trailing twelve month (TTM) revenue has soared to $71.7 billion from less than $40 billion in 2020. Analysts are warning about weakness in the semiconductor market next year, with Gartner predicting a 3.6% decline, which is in stark contrast to the sector’s 26.3% growth in 2021. Those fears are weighing on TSM shares, which have slumped by 38% this year. Longer-term though, which is what Buffett is more interested in, Taiwan Semiconductor looks like a winner, especially if VR takes off in the years to come.Baron Funds also likes Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)’s long-term growth outlook, as it detailed in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) detracted from performance due to the global macroeconomic slowdown and softening demand for consumer electronics. We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi’s technological leadership, pricing power, and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, and IoT, will allow the company to deliver strong revenue growth over the next several years.”9. Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) Value of Berkshire Hathaway‘s 13F Position: $4.47 Billion Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 96 Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) position by 13% during Q3, ending the quarter with over 60.1 million shares of the video game developer and publisher, which is best known for its Warcraft, Diablo, Call of Duty, and Overwatch series. Hedge fund ownership of ATVI has risen for three straight quarters, climbing by 32% during that time.Buffett first took a stake in Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) during the final quarter of 2021 and more than quadrupled the size of his ATVI holding during the following quarter, the same one in which it was announced that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) would acquire the company for $68.7 billion. It’s unknown whether or not Buffett had already purchased most of those Q1 shares before the announcement, but regardless, he clearly likes Activision’s stable of renowned series and the company’s strong sales and profits, though it’s stumbled somewhat on that front this year against tough pandemic comps.That proposed deal has been approved in some countries, but faces antitrust challenges in others, including the United States. The Federal Trade Commission appears intent on challenging the deal and blocking one of the largest tech companies and one of the three primary video game console manufacturers from acquiring one of the world’s largest game publishers. It’s been reported that Microsoft will make numerous concessions to try and see the deal through to completion, which includes licensing Call of Duty games to Sony consoles for at least ten years.Cooper Investors revealed why it missed out on the M&amp;A premium on Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) shares in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) – our investment preceded news that the company was under investigation for workplace bullying. When it became clear management had misled the market on the extent of the problem we sold, led by our principles of Responsible Investing. We did not benefit from the subsequent M&amp;A premium paid by Microsoft.”8. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) Value of Berkshire Hathaway‘s 13F Position: $6 Billion Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 63 Berkshire’s position in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) was left unchanged during Q3 at nearly 24.7 million shares. The value of the holding dipped by just over $700 million during the quarter and has fallen by more than $3.6 billion through September as MCO shares slumped by 38% during the first nine months of 2022.Buffett traditionally loves companies with big moats, or competitive advantages, which is why Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) all feature prominently in his portfolio. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is another company in that same vein, being one of the two primary credit ratings agencies and having a virtually unassailable position in that market in relation to any would-be upstarts.That alone doesn’t make a company valuable, and it’s true that Moody’s core business is struggling this year due to less debt issuance given the current market environment. That segment of its business will eventually rebound along with the market however, and Moody’s has some other growing businesses that are picking up some of the slack in the meantime, as its Analytics segment grew revenue by 18% year-over-year in Q2.Hedge funds were collectively bailing on Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)’s during Q2, but began buying back into the stock in Q3. Shares hit a 2-year low during the latest quarter, which may have prompted several hedge funds to go bargain hunting in anticipation of the bottom having been reached. Daniel S. Och’s Sculptor Capital and Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies were among the funds to add MCO to their portfolios during Q3.7. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) Value of Berkshire Hathaway‘s 13F Position: $10.9 Billion Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 41 Warren Buffett’s position in The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) has remained unchanged since the third quarter of 2015, when he helped facilitate the merger of Kraft and Heinz alongside Jorge Paulo Lemann’s 3G Capital (the two firms had owned Heinz since 2013). The position has been one of Buffett’s biggest mistakes to date, having lost over $12 billion worth of its value in the seven years since the merger.Buffett hasn’t shown any indications that he’s going to bail on his investment in The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) any time soon, as he told CNBC back in 2019 that while he may have made a mistake on the price he paid for the investment, he will nonetheless be happy to still own the stock five to ten years from now. Under CEO Miguel Patricio, who was appointed to the role in 2019, the company has undertaken several initiatives to improve its brand mix, labeling, and advertising, with mixed results. Its strong brand recognition has given it some pricing power in the current inflationary environment, but sales volumes did decline somewhat in Q2.There was a mild hedge fund exodus from The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) during 2016 and 2017, with ownership of the stock having remained relatively stable since. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group and Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management were some of the other major stakeholders in Kraft Heinz as of September 30.6. Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) Value of Berkshire Hathaway‘s 13F Position: $11.9 Billion Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 79 Closing out the first half of Warren Buffett’s top stock picks is Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), which the billionaire money manager raised his stake in by 23% during Q3, ending the quarter with over 194 million shares.Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is one of those energy industry additions to Buffett’s portfolio this year, having been added to it in the first quarter. He’s further added to his stake over each of the following two quarters. It’s not his first interaction with the company however, as he made a $10 billion preferred investment in it in 2019, which pays out an 8% annual dividend to Berkshire.The company plans to partially redeem that in the near future after having successfully paid off a big chunk of its debt load this year, with the company projecting that it will have shaved over $10 billion in debt off its balance sheet by year’s end. That will allow the company to redeem some of that preferred equity and return more money to shareholders next year, which is a win/win situation for Buffett.Hedge fund ownership of OXY has risen during seven of the past eight quarters to hit an all-time high during Q3. Glenn Russell Dubin’s Highbridge Capital Management and Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management were among the funds to add Occidental to their 13F portfolios during the latest quarter.The Smead Value Fund discussed the performance of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) and some of its other stock picks in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter (and yes, it should totally change its name to the Jed Clampett Fund):“Our top-performing stocks in the quarter includes Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Oil and gas have been the best game in the stock market town this year and it was a pleasant surprise to see home builders pick up even with dour news on interest rates and the economy. For the first three quarters of the year, we should change the name of our fund to the Jed Clampett Fund. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), was one of the standouts. Up through the bear market came a “bubblin’ crude!”See how many tens of billions Warren Buffett has invested in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Apple Inc.

328,daa55882-0001-38e1-98a2-ac3238c4e0dd,OXY,2022-12-01,3 Stocks to Buy to Benefit from a Looming Energy Crisis,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-buy-benefit-looming-182840106.html,1669573720,STORY,"['CVX', 'OXY', 'ALB']","[If we look at stocks to buy for the long term, the energy sector is likely to remain an important focal point for investors. A report by International Energy Agency indicates that the world is facing its first “truly global energy crisis.”Geopolitical factors remain the key reason for this situation. The European Union embargo on Russia oil imports likely to intensify disruptions in energy markets in 2023. Furthermore, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has pursued production cuts amidst economic uncertainty.Even as the world gradually shifts towards cleaner energy sources, fossil fuels will remain of key importance to all regions of the world. Thus, it’s not surprising that Warren Buffett has aggressively invested in two quality oil and gas exploration companies in 2022.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOf course, higher fossil fuel prices also imply that investments will accelerate in the alternative sources of energy. Attractive investment ideas would therefore include renewable energy sources and themes like electric vehicles.Let’s discuss three stocks to buy to benefit from a looming energy crisis and these aforementioned secular catalysts.CVXChevron Corporation$183.70OXYOccidental Petroleum$70.28ALBAlbermarle Corporation$272.82Chevron Corporation (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comWhile oil has corrected from highs of the year, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock has remained firm. This stock, which currently provides a dividend yield of 3.1%, is buoyed by a business model which has proven to be a cash flow machine.To put things into perspective, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $13.7 billion for Q3 2022. If oil trades in the region of $80 to $90 per barrel, the company is positioned to report annual cash flows of $40 billion.These cash flows will allow Chevron to increase dividends and pursue larger share repurchases. At the same time, Chevron is targeting massive capital investments of $15 to $17 billion annually over the next few years. These will ensure robust reserve replacement over time, providing for future growth.Story continuesIt’s also worth noting that Chevron is investing in reducing the company’s reliance on its carbon-heavy businesses. Chevron expects capital expenditures of $10 billion through 2028 in lower-carbon business segments. The focus will be on renewable natural gas, other renewable fuels, and renewable base oil &amp; lubricants.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock is another oil and gas exploration name that has remained resilient at higher levels. It also seems to be one of the favorite stocks for Warren Buffett. This isn’t a surprise, considering the company’s cash flow potential in the long-term.For Q3 2022, Occidental reported $3.6 billion in free cash flows. For the same period, the company reduced debt by $1.5 billion. Occidental plans to continue deleveraging, and as credit metrics improve, the stock is likely to trend higher.It’s also worth noting that as of December 2021, Occidental reported proved reserves of 3.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent. On a year-over-year basis, proven and probable reserves increased by 600 million barrels of oil equivalent. With robust financial flexibility, the company will continue to invest in exploration. This will translate into long term cash flow visibility for investors looking to play this space for years or decades.Finally (and perhaps most importantly), Occidental also has very low breakeven costs. Thus, even with oil trading around the $80 range, strong cash flow and dividend growth is likely to be sustained.Albemarle Corporation (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comA common policy focus of governments globally is to increase the adoption of electric vehicles in the coming decades. This will require significant investment in lithium production, to meet the surging demand for EV batteries. Just to put things into perspective, it’s estimated that by 2035, global lithium production is expected to come in at 1.1 million metric tons, or 24% lower than demand. Considering this key factor, Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) stock is attractive at current levels.The company has already been a key beneficiary of this supply and demand imbalance. Accordingly, with the company increasing lithium production, coupled with higher realized price, margins are set to really take off. This is already showing through in Albermarle’s results, with revenue and adjusted EBITDA for Q3 2022 increasing 152% and 447% respectively on a year-over-year basis. Albemarle has also guided for full-year adjusted EBITDA growth in the range of 280% to 300%. With robust cash flows, ALB stock is among the top-quality dividend growth stocks to buy.It’s also worth noting that the company reported lithium conversion capacity of 88,000 metric tons per year in February 2022. Albemarle expects to increase conversion capacity to 200,000 metric tons per year by 2025. Therefore, the company is positioned for sustained growth. If lithium prices continue to remain in an uptrend, the company’s cash flow outlook will continue to be extremely enticing.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

329,d6bbdbf0-b6ec-3bcf-b016-e6754db17aca,BSX,2022-12-01,Boston Scientific's (BSX) New Buyout to Expand its Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boston-scientifics-bsx-buyout-expand-161004672.html,1669824604,STORY,"['BSX', 'AMN', 'SWAV']","[Boston Scientific Corporation BSX recently announced its entry into a definitive agreement to acquire Apollo Endosurgery, Inc. APEN. The latest buyout is expected to expand Boston Scientific’s endoluminal surgery (ELS) portfolio and add differentiated technologies for endobariatric procedures.The transaction, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2023, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, is likely to have an immaterial impact on Boston Scientific's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in 2023 but accretive thereafter. The impact on GAAP EPS is expected to be less accretive or more dilutive, as the case may be, due to amortization expense and acquisition-related net charges.Apollo Endosurgery’s endoscopic suturing system franchise includes its OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System, OverStitch Sx Endoscopic Suturing System and X-Tack Endoscopic HeliX Tacking System.The latest buyout is expected to be a significant addition to Boston Scientific's Endoscopy business, thereby strengthening its foothold in the new adjacency it is entering, the endobariatric market.Rationale Behind the AcquisitionThe Apollo Endosurgery product portfolio includes devices used during ELS procedures to close gastrointestinal defects, manage gastrointestinal complications and aid in weight loss for patients suffering from obesity. ELS provides a less-invasive option unlike open and laparoscopic surgery for patients with diseases in the gastrointestinal tract or morbid obesity. It also provides the possibility of faster recovery and minimizes the risks of surgical complications.In July 2022, Apollo Endosurgery received the FDA de novo clearance for its Apollo ESG, Apollo ESG Sx, Apollo REVISE and Apollo REVISE Sx Systems, the first devices authorized by the FDA for endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty and endoscopic bariatric revision procedures. The company's endobariatric portfolio also includes the Orbera Intragastric Balloon for endoscopic weight management.Story continuesPer Boston Scientific's management, the company expects to expand its global capabilities in ELS with the differentiated products of Apollo Endosurgery. Management also believes that the acquisition will likely enable it to enter the new adjacency of the endobariatric market and deliver strong, continued growth across its business. The company is currently aiming to tap into the emerging field of ELS, which is a core focus of its Endoscopy business.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Research and Markets published on Business Wire, the global endoluminal suturing devices market is anticipated to reach $152.3 million by 2028 at a CAGR of 12% between 2022 and 2028. Factors like the growing demand for weight loss procedures, higher adoption of endoluminal practices as a well-known technique to accelerate the weight reduction process and the rising prevalence of chronic diseases resulting from an increase in unhealthy lifestyles are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest acquisition is likely to provide a significant boost to Boston Scientific’s business globally.Notable Development in Endoscopy BusinessLast month, Boston Scientific announced its third-quarter 2022 results, where it registered better-than-expected revenues. The company also registered a year-over-year improvement in organic sales, indicating a strong rebound in the legacy business amid several macroeconomic issues.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.00bUS$4.57bUS$4.95bUS$5.40bUS$5.73bUS$6.02bUS$6.26bUS$6.47bUS$6.67bUS$6.85bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x5Est @ 6.2%Est @ 4.94%Est @ 4.05%Est @ 3.43%Est @ 2.99%Est @ 2.69% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3% US$3.8kUS$4.0kUS$4.1kUS$4.2kUS$4.2kUS$4.2kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.8kUS$3.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$40bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.3%– 2.0%) = US$162bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$162b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)10= US$88bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$128b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$316, the company appears quite good value at a 37% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Vertex Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.842. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

The detailed data showed that the mean change of CDR-SB from baseline at 18 months as was 1.21 in the lecanemab arm and 1.66 for the placebo groups.The study met all key secondary endpoints, demonstrating highly statistically significant results.  On a scale called ADAS-Cog14, lecanemab slowed the decline of cognitive function by 26% at 18 months. In another assessment called AD Composite Score (ADCOMS), lecanemab slowed disease progression by 24% at 18 months. In the ADCS MCI-ADL scale, lecanemab slowed the decline of activities of daily living by 37%.With regard to the candidate’s safety, lecanemab led to infusion-related reactions in 26.4% of the participants and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), a brain swelling side effect associated with anti-amyloid antibodies, with edema or effusions in 12.6% of the participants. Deaths occurred in 0.7% and 0.8% of participants in the lecanemab and placebo groups, respectively. However, Eisai said no deaths were related to lecanemab. Earlier this week, there were reports of the death of a 65-year-old woman from a massive brain hemorrhage, who was given lecanemab in a phase III extension portion.Story continuesSuch news and adverse events observed in the Clarity AD study raise concerns over the drug’s safetyThe detailed data were also published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The NEJM article concluded that the candidate did reduce markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer’s disease and led to moderately less decline in measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months. However, treatment with lecanemab was associated with adverse events. The article said that longer trials were needed to establish the candidate’s efficacy and safety in early Alzheimer’s disease.Biogen’s stock has risen 21.5% this year so far against a decline of 19.9% for the industry. Biogen stock is up more than 49% since the Clarity AD study’s initial data were announced in September Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Biogen/Eisai have already filed their biologics license application (“BLA”), seeking accelerated approval for lecanemab with the FDA. The BLA was supported by data from a phase II study (Study 201). The FDA accepted the BLA and granted priority review to the same. The FDA’s decision is expected on Jan 6, 2023.Eisai plans to file for traditional approval of lecanemab in the United States and submit regulatory applications in the EU and Japan by the end of the first quarter of 2023 based on data from the Clarity AD studyBiogen has developed lecanemab in collaboration with Eisai, with the latter leading the clinical development and regulatory submissions. The companies also developed another anti-amyloid antibody, Aduhelm, which was approved by the FDA in June 2021 but failed to generate meaningful sales.Some other large-cap pharma giants like Roche RHHBY and Eli Lilly LLY are also developing their candidates targeting the AD indication. The Alzheimer’s candidates of these companies — also anti-amyloid beta antibodies — are in late-stage development or review and are expected to be launched in a few months.Eli Lilly’s BLA seeking accelerated approval of donanemab, based on data from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study, is already under review with the FDA. A decision is expected in early 2023. Lilly also expects a data readout from the phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 by mid-2023, which, if positive, will form the basis of its application for traditional regulatory approval for donanemab.Roche’s phase III GRADUATE I and II studies on key Alzheimer’s pipeline candidate, gantenerumab failed to meet the primary endpointof slowing clinical decline in people with early Alzheimer’s disease earlier this month. In the study, participants treated with gantenerumab showed a slowing of the clinical decline of -0.31 and -0.19, respectively in the GRADUATE I and GRADUATE II studies from the baseline score on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes scale. However, this decline was not statistically significant in either of the studies. This represented a relative reduction in the clinical decline of 8% in GRADUATE I and 6% in GRADUATE II compared with placebo. The level of beta-amyloid removal by gantenerumab was less than expected. Roche was developing the candidate in collaboration with MorphoSys.Zacks Rank &amp; Stock to ConsiderBiogen has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's lofty.Recent times have been advantageous for Norfolk Southern as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern peKeen to find out how analysts think Norfolk Southern's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Enough Growth For Norfolk Southern?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as high as Norfolk Southern's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 17% last year. EPS has also lifted 29% in aggregate from three years ago, mostly thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been respectable for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 6.4% per annum over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 9.0% each year growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's alarming that Norfolk Southern's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently many investors in the company are way more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock at any price. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Norfolk Southern's P/E?While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Our examination of Norfolk Southern's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E anywhere near as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are increasingly uncomfortable with the high P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium.You should always think about risks. Case in point, we've spotted   1 warning sign for Norfolk Southern  you should be aware of.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Norfolk Southern, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

UNP, Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. CP, CSX Corp. CSX and Norfolk Southern Corp. NSC.Industry: RailroadLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2022908/4-railroad-stocks-to-capitalize-on-strong-freight-demandThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry is being aided by a steady improvement in freight demand, thanks to the buoyant U.S. economy, which is driving growth for the railroads. Despite this tailwind, the industry is being plagued by escalating fuel prices and supply-chain disruptions.Companies like Union Pacific Corp., Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd., CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. are expected to thrive on upbeat freight demand.About the IndustryThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry consists of railroad operators transporting freight (such as agricultural products, industrial products, coal, intermodal, automotive, consumer products, metals and minerals), primarily across North America. These companies focus on providing logistics and supply-chain expertise services.While freight constitutes a significant chunk of revenues, some of these companies also derive a small portion of their top line from other rail-related services, including third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, routine land sales and container sales, among others. A few companies offer service to multiple production and distribution facilities. Besides owning locomotives, some of these companies have equipment of leased locomotives, railcars etc.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Railroad IndustryHealthy Freight Demand: Freight demand continues to be strong in 2022 as pandemic fears fade, despite softening from the 2021 levels due to a shift in consumer spending from goods to services. The Cass Freight Index rose 2.9% on a year-over-year basis in October. With steady freight demand, railroads are benefiting from higher volumes and pricing gains. The upbeat freight environment is expected to continue in the near term.Story continuesDividend Hikes Signal Financial Strength: With the resumption of economic activities, many players, including some railroad companies are reactivating their shareholder-friendly measures like paying out dividends, which underline their solid financial footing and confidence in the business. Earlier in 2022, both UNP &amp; CSX upped its dividend 10% and 7.5% to $1.30 per share and 10 cents per share, respectively.Supply-Chain Disruptions a Woe: Persistent supply-chain disruptions, including labor and equipment shortages, are hurting railroad volumes in some segments, especially the carload and intermodal unit. Per The Association of American Railroads' latest rail traffic data, the total U.S. carload and intermodal units declined 0.5% year over year in October 2022. Supply-chain disruptions are likely to persist for a while now, thus denting carload and intermodal volumes.High Fuel Costs Hurt Bottom Line: Operating expenses are on the rise, mainly due to increased fuel costs. Fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player. High oil price (up 5.7% in the first nine months of 2022) is augmenting fuel costs. Even though oil price declined from its multi-year highs due to recession fears, it remains elevated.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Railroad industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #93. This rank places it in the top 37% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, implies encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry's position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimate has been revised 1.1% upward since June-end.Given the bullish near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few noteworthy stocks that you may want to hold in your portfolio. But it's worth looking at the industry's shareholder returns and its current valuation first.Industry's Price PerformanceOver the past year, the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry has declined 6.1% compared with the S&amp;P 500 composite's fall of 15.1% and the broader sector's decrease of 12%.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), a commonly used multiple for valuing railroad stocks, the industry is currently trading at 7.41X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 5.61X. It is also above the sector's P/B ratio of 4.27X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 10.86X, as low as 5.69X and at the median of 8.08X.4 Railroad Stocks to Keep Tabs OnEach of the stocks mentioned below currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Union Pacific: Based in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific provides rail transportation services across the United States.With economic activities gaining pace, freight revenues, accounting for the bulk of UNP's top line, are improving. In the first nine months of 2022, freight revenues improved 16% year over year. Segmentwise, freight revenues in the first nine months of 2022 increased 16%, 14% and 19% in the bulk, industrial and premium units, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNP's 2022 earnings is pegged at 15.8% growth from the 2021 reported number.Canadian Pacific: Headquartered in Calgary, Canada, Canadian Pacific operates a transcontinental railway network in Canada and the United States.With the gradual recovery in freight-market conditions, freight revenues, contributing considerably to the top line, increased 4% in 2021. In third-quarter 2022, freight revenues increased 19% despite headwinds like supply-chain woes remaining.The increase was owing to higher freight revenues at key sub-groups like intermodal where freight revenues surged 44%. Revenues at the Fertilizers and sulphur sub-segment were up 11% year over year.In the September quarter, total freight revenues per revenue ton-miles (RTMs) rose 11% year over year. Total freight revenues per carload rose 7% from the year-ago quarter's reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CP's 2022 revenues is pegged at 1.8% growth from the 2021 actuals.CSX: Based in Jacksonville, FL, CSX offers rail-based freight transportation services like traditional rail service, and transport of intermodal containers and trailers besides rail-to-truck transfers.CSX's top line is benefiting from higher export coal volumes, solid domestic intermodal shipments, volume growth in other segments and pricing gains. Evidently, coal revenues increased 36% in the first nine months of 2022, driven by strength in export coal. Intermodal revenues increased 19% in the first nine months of 2022, led by strong demand, mainly on the domestic front. Demand is likely to remain strong going forward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CSX's 2022 revenues stands at 22.4% growth from the year-ago reported figure.Norfolk Southern: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, Norfolk Southern is a major freight railroad company, primarily engaged in transporting raw material, intermediate products and finished goods.A strong demand scenario prompted management to increase its current-year revenue growth outlook. Total revenues are now expected to increase above 13% in 2022 from the 2021 levels (earlier outlook: growth in excess of 12%). The intermodal and merchandise segments are expected to be the main drivers.Near-term opportunities are present in the coal segment too. Driven by revenue growth, reported the operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is expected to be roughly 62% in 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NSC's 2022 earnings stands at 13.6% growth from the year-ago reading.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

If you want to see more of the best defensive stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Defensive Stocks to Buy Now.Defensive stocks are stocks that generate relatively stable performances regardless of the market cycle. Defensive stocks generally don't fall as much as the overall market in recessionary times and they might not do as well as the market in more expansionary times. Examples of defensive stocks are leading consumer staples that produce or sell necessities that are in demand throughout the market cycle. Other defensive stocks have very wide moats and substantial competitive advantages that allow them to largely maintain their financial performance during recessions.Given their relatively stable performances, many defensive stocks pay dividends that are pretty consistent. Many of the same defensive stocks have also raised their annual dividends for many consecutive years. If interested also check out 12 Best Consumer Staple Stocks.It should be noted that defensive stocks may not always remain defensive stocks because industries and company management constantly change. If an industry undergoes secular decline, defensive stocks can underperform. Similarly if a formerly defensive company's management decided to overpay for an acquisition, the stock might not do well either.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.2022 has been a challenging year in the market as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times to fight inflation. Although October's core inflation data has shown some positive signs that inflation could be peaking, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard recently said he thought interest rates might need to rise to 5% or higher and stay there until into 2024 before the U.S. central bank can begin to normalize its monetary policy again.Story continuesGiven the interest rate increases and the expected economic slowdown in 2023, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 17.5% year to date and the NASDAQ has declined 30.6% year to date.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Defensive Stocks to Buy Now, we took 12 stocks that have defensive qualities that have outperformed the S&amp;P 500's decline of 17.5% year to date in 2022.We then ranked the 12 stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q3 2022.12 Best Defensive Stocks to Buy Now12.

If you want to read about some more safe stocks, go directly to 5 Safe Stocks to Buy For Beginner Investors.The collapse of the cryptocurrency market in the past few months has highlighted the perils of investing in speculative assets, especially to retail investors or beginners who had only just begun their investing careers and now face the daunting prospect of losing a vast portion of their wealth due to the slowing macro environment. In addition to crypto, other riskier growth stocks are also down. The NASDAQ Composite, made up primarily of tech-heavy firms, is down close to 30% year-to-date, as of November 28. However, the shares of established tech giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) have withstood the macro pressures better than feared. This resilience has underlined the importance of balancing portfolios with safe stocks that offer reliable dividend payouts and have pricing power to protect against inflation. Beginner investors, who have gained in prominence on Wall Street since the GameStop short squeeze saga of early 2021, should study the investing habits of titans like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, or elite hedge funds, to understand these concepts better. Our MethodologyThe companies that have established business models that have demonstrated historical resilience against inflationary headwinds were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.14 Safe Stocks to Buy For Beginner InvestorsPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashSafe Stocks to Buy For Beginner Investors14.

We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”13.

(NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that, while the memory industry is cyclical, we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company, as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”11.

Here is what the fund said:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”10.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In 2014, before we began to invest in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), I called Roger to ask whether he thought Elon Musk’s electric car business would succeed. I did not believe that Roger, an owner of dealerships that sell cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) would likely have a favorable opinion of Tesla’s prospects. That was principally for two reasons:First, automobile manufacturing and distribution is unusually complicated, capital intensive, and highly regulated, which makes profitability problematic;second, cars with ICE motors require extensive annual maintenance, and dealer services revenues, not profits from automobile sales, are the most important contributor to profits of perpetual licensed ICE car dealerships.Penske Automotive Group is principally an ICE car dealer. Since electric cars are powered by batteries and need little service, franchised dealerships are incented to sell ICE, not EV automobiles. Further, Roger had been a long-term director of General Motors. General Motors’ ICE automobile business would be disrupted if Tesla were successful. (click here to read more…)8.

Here is what the fund said:“At the company-specific level, there was a broad correction across the entire portfolio. While four of our holdings contributed to performance, the contribution to absolute returns was less than 100bps combined, as unfortunately none of them was large enough to move the needle. We had 16 investments detracting over 100bps each with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), our second largest detractor, costing the Fund 254bps.NVIDIA’s stock was hit even harder, down 44.4%, impacted by concerns over the health of the consumer, dramatic declines in crypto, and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Despite the sell-off and the increased near-term volatility in its gaming business, NVIDIA’s revenues grew 46% year-over-year with 48% operating margins, driven by continued strength in its data center business as companies across industries adopt AI and ML…(read more)7.

The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Safe Stocks to Buy For Beginner Investors. Suggested Articles:12 Best Nancy Pelosi Stocks To BuyTop 10 Green Hydrogen Companies in the World15 Best Self-Driving Car Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

This performance momentum has been underpinned by a history of outperformance, with the recent strong Q3 report the 10th straight quarter of better-than-expected top and bottom line results. Sales improved year over year driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments.Improved productivity amid cost headwinds has also aided the results. It witnessed SG&amp;A expense leverage, owing to savings from overhead and marketing expenses, and cost leverage gains due to higher sales and real estate.However, commodity cost inflation, increase in freight costs, product and packaging investments and other impacts hurt margins.

343,5ccf3dfe-9672-3253-802c-17111cd9b3bf,KO,2022-12-01,Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-stock-portfolio-top-134653882.html,1669816013,STORY,"['BAC', 'TSM', 'ATVI', 'OXY', 'KO', 'AAPL', 'KHC']","[In this article we’ll dive into the Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks. For the Oracle of Omaha’s top stock picks, check out the Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) are some of the gigantic stock positions owned by billionaire investing icon Warren Buffett’s holding company Berkshire Hathaway.92-year-old investing legend Warren Buffett is still going strong as the CEO of his $700 billion holding company Berkshire Hathaway, which he’s helmed for close to six decades. During that time, Berkshire Hathaway has generated brain-melting returns of over 3.64 million percent, meaning $100 invested in Berkshire in 1965 would’ve turned into more than $3.64 million today.Not surprisingly, Buffett himself is one of the richest men in the world, with a personal fortune estimated by Forbes at $110 billion, making him the sixth-richest person in the world. Buffett could in fact be significantly wealthier than that, but has donated nearly $50 billion worth of his own shares in Berkshire Hathaway to various charitable causes over the years, including to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, which is managed by Michael Larson.While Buffett maintains the same buy-and-hold investment philosophy that has underpinned much of his success over the years, his targets have changed considerably. Tech stocks now dominate Berkshire’s 13F portfolio, accounting for 44% of its 13F AUM. One tech stock in particular accounts for the lion’s share of that amount, while Buffett also made another notable tech addition to Berkshire’s portfolio during Q3.The bulk of Berkshire’s remaining 13F assets are distributed primarily between three other sectors, energy, finance, and consumer staples, the latter two of which dominated Berkshire’s sector allocation for many years, accounting for as much as 85% of the holding company’s assets. In the case of energy stocks, Berkshire has invested more heavily in them this year than it has in decades, with its prior noteworthy forays into the sector coming in 2008 and 2013.Story continuesUnlike several other prominent money managers, Buffett hasn’t shown any bearishness in the current economic environment when it comes to pulling Berkshire’s assets out of the equities market. The firm’s 13F AUM rose slightly in Q1 and did decline by about 17% during Q2, but that was about in line with the market’s overall performance.The firm’s 13F AUM was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter during Q3, dipping slightly to $296 billion. Berkshire added three new holdings to its 13F portfolio during the quarter, while selling off one former position. Even then, the latter move was due to the company in question, STORE Capital Corporation (NYSE:STOR), being acquired during the quarter.Now then, let’s take a look at the top ten stock picks from Warren Buffett’s 13F portfolio as of September 30, which the investing legend has hundreds of billions of dollars riding on.Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock PicksOur MethodologyThe following data is gathered from Berkshire Hathaway’s latest 13F filing with the SEC. We follow hedge funds like Berkshire Hathaway because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q3 2022 reporting period.Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks10. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) Value of Berkshire Hathaway‘s 13F Position: $4.12 Billion Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 90 Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) are some of the long-term cornerstones of Warren Buffett’s portfolio. One of the newest additions to his portfolio is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), which Buffett’s holding company bought over 60 million shares of during Q3. TSM shares jumped by 10.5% on November 15 following the reveal of Buffett’s position.Buffett wasn’t the only hedge fund manager buying shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) during Q3, as the stock ended the quarter at an all-time high in terms of hedge fund ownership among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates and Stanley Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Capital are two other prominent investors that took stakes in TSM during the quarter.Given Buffett’s huge stake in Apple, it’s perhaps somewhat overdue that he also invests in one of the company’s primary chip suppliers in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), which generates about a quarter of its revenue from Apple. TSM’s trailing twelve month (TTM) revenue has soared to $71.7 billion from less than $40 billion in 2020. Analysts are warning about weakness in the semiconductor market next year, with Gartner predicting a 3.6% decline, which is in stark contrast to the sector’s 26.3% growth in 2021. Those fears are weighing on TSM shares, which have slumped by 38% this year. Longer-term though, which is what Buffett is more interested in, Taiwan Semiconductor looks like a winner, especially if VR takes off in the years to come.Baron Funds also likes Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)’s long-term growth outlook, as it detailed in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) detracted from performance due to the global macroeconomic slowdown and softening demand for consumer electronics. We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi’s technological leadership, pricing power, and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, and IoT, will allow the company to deliver strong revenue growth over the next several years.”9. Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) Value of Berkshire Hathaway‘s 13F Position: $4.47 Billion Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 96 Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) position by 13% during Q3, ending the quarter with over 60.1 million shares of the video game developer and publisher, which is best known for its Warcraft, Diablo, Call of Duty, and Overwatch series. Hedge fund ownership of ATVI has risen for three straight quarters, climbing by 32% during that time.Buffett first took a stake in Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) during the final quarter of 2021 and more than quadrupled the size of his ATVI holding during the following quarter, the same one in which it was announced that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) would acquire the company for $68.7 billion. It’s unknown whether or not Buffett had already purchased most of those Q1 shares before the announcement, but regardless, he clearly likes Activision’s stable of renowned series and the company’s strong sales and profits, though it’s stumbled somewhat on that front this year against tough pandemic comps.That proposed deal has been approved in some countries, but faces antitrust challenges in others, including the United States. The Federal Trade Commission appears intent on challenging the deal and blocking one of the largest tech companies and one of the three primary video game console manufacturers from acquiring one of the world’s largest game publishers. It’s been reported that Microsoft will make numerous concessions to try and see the deal through to completion, which includes licensing Call of Duty games to Sony consoles for at least ten years.Cooper Investors revealed why it missed out on the M&amp;A premium on Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) shares in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) – our investment preceded news that the company was under investigation for workplace bullying. When it became clear management had misled the market on the extent of the problem we sold, led by our principles of Responsible Investing. We did not benefit from the subsequent M&amp;A premium paid by Microsoft.”8. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) Value of Berkshire Hathaway‘s 13F Position: $6 Billion Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 63 Berkshire’s position in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) was left unchanged during Q3 at nearly 24.7 million shares. The value of the holding dipped by just over $700 million during the quarter and has fallen by more than $3.6 billion through September as MCO shares slumped by 38% during the first nine months of 2022.Buffett traditionally loves companies with big moats, or competitive advantages, which is why Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) all feature prominently in his portfolio. Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) is another company in that same vein, being one of the two primary credit ratings agencies and having a virtually unassailable position in that market in relation to any would-be upstarts.That alone doesn’t make a company valuable, and it’s true that Moody’s core business is struggling this year due to less debt issuance given the current market environment. That segment of its business will eventually rebound along with the market however, and Moody’s has some other growing businesses that are picking up some of the slack in the meantime, as its Analytics segment grew revenue by 18% year-over-year in Q2.Hedge funds were collectively bailing on Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)’s during Q2, but began buying back into the stock in Q3. Shares hit a 2-year low during the latest quarter, which may have prompted several hedge funds to go bargain hunting in anticipation of the bottom having been reached. Daniel S. Och’s Sculptor Capital and Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies were among the funds to add MCO to their portfolios during Q3.7. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) Value of Berkshire Hathaway‘s 13F Position: $10.9 Billion Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 41 Warren Buffett’s position in The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) has remained unchanged since the third quarter of 2015, when he helped facilitate the merger of Kraft and Heinz alongside Jorge Paulo Lemann’s 3G Capital (the two firms had owned Heinz since 2013). The position has been one of Buffett’s biggest mistakes to date, having lost over $12 billion worth of its value in the seven years since the merger.Buffett hasn’t shown any indications that he’s going to bail on his investment in The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) any time soon, as he told CNBC back in 2019 that while he may have made a mistake on the price he paid for the investment, he will nonetheless be happy to still own the stock five to ten years from now. Under CEO Miguel Patricio, who was appointed to the role in 2019, the company has undertaken several initiatives to improve its brand mix, labeling, and advertising, with mixed results. Its strong brand recognition has given it some pricing power in the current inflationary environment, but sales volumes did decline somewhat in Q2.There was a mild hedge fund exodus from The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) during 2016 and 2017, with ownership of the stock having remained relatively stable since. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group and Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management were some of the other major stakeholders in Kraft Heinz as of September 30.6. Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) Value of Berkshire Hathaway‘s 13F Position: $11.9 Billion Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 79 Closing out the first half of Warren Buffett’s top stock picks is Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), which the billionaire money manager raised his stake in by 23% during Q3, ending the quarter with over 194 million shares.Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is one of those energy industry additions to Buffett’s portfolio this year, having been added to it in the first quarter. He’s further added to his stake over each of the following two quarters. It’s not his first interaction with the company however, as he made a $10 billion preferred investment in it in 2019, which pays out an 8% annual dividend to Berkshire.The company plans to partially redeem that in the near future after having successfully paid off a big chunk of its debt load this year, with the company projecting that it will have shaved over $10 billion in debt off its balance sheet by year’s end. That will allow the company to redeem some of that preferred equity and return more money to shareholders next year, which is a win/win situation for Buffett.Hedge fund ownership of OXY has risen during seven of the past eight quarters to hit an all-time high during Q3. Glenn Russell Dubin’s Highbridge Capital Management and Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management were among the funds to add Occidental to their 13F portfolios during the latest quarter.The Smead Value Fund discussed the performance of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) and some of its other stock picks in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter (and yes, it should totally change its name to the Jed Clampett Fund):“Our top-performing stocks in the quarter includes Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Oil and gas have been the best game in the stock market town this year and it was a pleasant surprise to see home builders pick up even with dour news on interest rates and the economy. For the first three quarters of the year, we should change the name of our fund to the Jed Clampett Fund. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), was one of the standouts. Up through the bear market came a “bubblin’ crude!”See how many tens of billions Warren Buffett has invested in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Apple Inc.

(NYSE:CVNA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43     Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA) operates an e-commerce platform for buying and selling used cars in the United States.

(NYSE:CVNA) with 6.8 million shares worth more than $138.6 million. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Steel City Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“As I write, Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA), a long-time short, is circling the drain. After reporting earnings, shares have been roughly cut in half while the company’s bonds are now priced anywhere from 35- to 45 cents on the dollar, with yields ranging from 25% to 40%. While the shares already experienced a steep decline during the past year, the post-earnings sell-off appears to reflect investors finally acknowledging the company’s near-term liquidity issues. Raising capital – debt or equity – seems unlikely, if not impossible. Bulls had been holding on to the hope CVNA would meet its stated “goal” of generating “significantly positive EBITDA in FY 2023,” but management walked back that aspiration last week. I always thought the word “goal” reflected squishy language that never carried the same weight as “guidance” and drew conclusions accordingly. The difference is much the same as me telling my wife I have a “goal” of having washboard abs vs. “guidance” that I will have them by swimsuit season. The language was deliberate (and probably highly lawyered), and in my estimation, reflected an effort to give bulls something to cling on to without the company exposing itself to a lawsuit when they (inevitably) missed.”7.

(NYSE:CCI) stock and lowered the price target to $150 from $202, noting that the company's third-quarter results were in-line and set a more conservative target multiple given the macroeconomic backdrop.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Camas, Washington-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Crown Castle Inc.

The stock underperformed as, driven by rising interest rates, investors rotated away from defensive into more value-oriented sectors. Communications infrastructure remains attractive, however, as companies continue to deploy greater capital spending to support the strong tailwinds from 5G.”6. United Parcel Service, Inc.

Each stock was up 1% in the quarter compared to the 16% price decline for the S&amp;P 500 and the positions were reduced as the valuations became somewhat less appealing, though still attractive enough to warrant inclusion.”14. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 85Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) is a New York-based multinational investment bank and financial services company that provides related services to its consumers. In November, JPMorgan raised its price target on the stock to $49.50 with a Neutral rating on the shares.

The company's cash position for the quarter remained strong for the quarter, as it generated $9 billion in free cash flow.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Shares of Citigroup declined in the quarter as investors became increasingly negative on capital markets activity. The company is also continuing to divest certain consumer banking geographies which may be dilutive to earnings in the near term.”13. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is a California-based business software company that mainly deals in financial software. In fiscal Q1 2023, the company posted revenue of $2.6 billion, which showed a 29.4% growth from the prior-year period.

(NASDAQ:INTU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We took advantage of its 2022 price decline to add a small position in Intuit. INTU is a leading SaaS software solutions provider to small businesses, consumers, and professional accountants, best known for its QuickBooks accounting and TurboTax tax preparation platforms. INTU recently strengthened its personal finance offerings with the acquisitions of Mint and Credit Karma, and its small business offering with the acquisition of email marketing platform Mailchimp. The company is benefitting from the secular shift to digitization for both businesses and consumers. Given its vast amount of valuable personal finance and tax customer data from its 100 million + customer installed base, the company can apply artificial intelligence to the data to generate actionable intelligence for customers, as well as a large cross-selling opportunity across its products.Given INTU’s less than 5% penetration of its $300 billion market, we believe the company can grow its top-line mid-teens, while improving its high-margin business model of greater than 80% gross margins and greater than 35% EBITDA margin, leading to high-teens EPS growth for the foreseeable future. At about 2% of revenue, the company also requires limited capital expenditures, producing significant and growing FCF, which INTU has used for acquisitions, a small dividend, debt repayment and stock buybacks.”12. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an American multinational software and tech company.

Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is a Washington-based diversified company that specializes in medical, industrial, and commercial products and also provides related services. The company is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as it has been raising its dividends consistently for the past eight years.

Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake in the company in Q3.Cooper Investments mentioned Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Spin-offs have been a valuable source of uncorrelated return for the portfolio since inception, whether investing in them directly or retaining ownership stakes in the spun-off assets of existing holdings. During the quarter Danaher announced the spin of its Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions group (EAS) expected to close in late 2023. Danaher have been masters of the spin over the last decade and once again this one appears to make sense for both parties. The parent becomes a pure-play life sciences and diagnostics business with higher growth, margins and returns plus more M&amp;A firepower. EAS, with leading positions in water quality through assets like Hach, ChemTreat and Trojan will, as a standalone business, have a more focused M&amp;A strategy and represent an attractive water-related exposure for ESG focused funds. The spinco will still operate with the highly regarded Danaher Business System though (like ‘Fortive Business System’) we expect this to get rebranded while still delivering outstanding financial results.”10. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a Georgia-based multinational home improvement company that sells tools and related construction products. Truist held a Buy rating on the stock in November with a $382 price target.

(NYSE:HD), up from 80 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $5.6 billion.Diamond Hill Capital mentioned The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) shares were more resilient in Q3 as the company continues to perform well and reiterated guidance despite increasing market concerns regarding general inflationary pressures and the impact rising mortgage rates may have on the housing market. We view the longterm prospects and multi-year fundamental outlook as unchanged. Home improvement through repair and remodel is likely to be one of more resilient housing-related industries given the relative attractiveness for consumers to renovate existing homes rather than reset their current low fixed mortgage rate to higher rates that we’re seeing today.”9. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 90S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is an American company that specializes in financial information and analytics.

(NYSE:SPGI) to $393 with an Outperform rating, highlighting the company's overall performance this year.As of the close of Q3 2022, 90 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), compared with 84 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of $6.2 billion. Among these hedge funds, TCI Fund Management was the company's largest stakeholder in Q3.Baron Funds mentioned S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Shares of rating agency and data provider S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) fell 9% during the third quarter due to continued weak debt issuance activity and headwinds to the Indices business from equity market declines. Credit markets were exceptionally soft during the quarter with non-financial corporate bond issuance down 36% for investment grade and down 84% for high yield, reflecting greater investor risk aversion, rising interest rates, and a drop-off in M&amp;A activity. We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year. Over the long term, the company should continue benefiting from the secular trends of increasing bond issuance, growth in passive investing, and demand for data and analytics, while enjoying meaningful and durable competitive advantages that, in our view, are only strengthening following the merger with IHS Markit.”8. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is an American supplier of scientific instrumentation and also provides related software services.

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is an American multinational financial services holding company. In November, Citigroup maintained a Neutral rating on the stock with a $40 price target, highlighting the company's efficient capital returns over the years.Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) holds a nine-year track record of consistent dividend growth, which places it as one of the best dividend stocks on our list. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share for a dividend yield of 2.38%, as of November 29.As of the close of Q3 2022, 97 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned investments in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), worth over $35.6 billion collectively. Berkshire Hathaway was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.Here is what Artisan Partners said about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We made only one new purchase during the quarter, initiating a position in Bank of America (BAC). As one of America’s largest banks, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is second only to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in size and is probably its closest peer. Both are well-run banks, but compared to JPM, since the GFC, BAC has retired more shares, grown EPS faster and currently has more capital and a lower dividend payout. We are attracted to BAC’s strong capital base, high capital generation capacity, large loan loss reserve, low (~50%) loan/deposit ratio, short duration investment securities book, and low dividend payout that provides financial flexibility. BAC has a less volatile earnings stream than JPM with lower capital market sensitive exposures. Additionally, BAC is rigorously stress tested by the Fed every year in quantitative and qualitative fashion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which we hold in the portfolio, owns 12% of BAC. He petitioned the Fed to own more than 10%, so he clearly likes it. Bank stocks were strong gainers in 2021 on the prospects of higher rates boosting net interest margins, but the stocks pulled back in the first half of 2022 on economic concerns. We believe BAC has massive scale advantages, should benefit from increasing interest rates, particularly in the 2-year part of the yield curve, and should grow over time with the economy. The economic environment is highly uncertain, but current consensus includes the provision for losses more than doubling and capital markets activity slowing. Against that backdrop, our purchase price equated to about 8.5X our estimates of “mid-cycle” earnings. With leading businesses, a double-digit ROE, a prudent capital return strategy and a strong balance sheet, we believe this entry point offers a solid long-term value.”6. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 110JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is an American multinational investment bank and financial services holding company. The company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past seven years, coming through as one of the best dividend stocks on our list.

Still, he doubts investors will consider the numbers fully derisked in the near term with a potential forthcoming recession.He likes the shares on a longer-term basis on the strength of the TurboTax and QuickBooks platforms, with the upcoming U.S. tax season as the next major catalyst.KeyBanc analyst Josh Beck maintained Intuit with an Overweight and lowered the price target from $450 to $400.Intuit reported a somewhat mixed set of results.Quickbooks (SBSE) outperformed while Credit Karma came to light, consistent to some degree with his preview when he lowered Credit Karma estimates below the Street.Headwinds like personal loan credit tightening, home, auto softness, and the assumption of rising unemployment, thus delinquency rates, contributed to a much lower Credit Karma revenue outlook.He reduced his revenue estimates, primarily due to lower Credit Karma estimates. Lowered revenue estimates led to a lower price target.He remains Overweight as ~3/4 of the revenue across Quickbooks, and Turbotax generally remains more macro resilient, an untapped opportunity to execute on the embedded finance opportunity and sustained TT share gain opportunity.Mizuho analyst Siti Panigrahi reiterated Buy on Intuit and the $650 price target.Intuit de-risked Credit Karma by significantly lowering FY23 CK guidance while maintaining the FY23 bottom line, reflecting the resilience and flexibility of its business model.With Q1 outperformance, small business growth implies only 14% Y/Y for the remainder of FY23, further derisking that segment.Therefore, he expects Intuit to comfortably beat and raise through FY23, supported by defensive revenues primarily from tax and QBO subscriptions.With CK and SMB de-risked, strong cash flows, and consistent shareholder returns, he considers Intuit the most defensive software name heading into calendar 2023.Price Action: INTU shares traded higher by 4.00% at $394.91 on the last check Wednesday.Photo Via Wikimedia CommonsStory continuesLatest Ratings for INTUDateFirmActionFromToFeb 2022KeybancMaintainsOverweightFeb 2022Deutsche BankMaintainsBuyFeb 2022OppenheimerMaintainsOutperformView More Analyst Ratings for INTUView the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from BenzingaIntuit's Prime Products Likely To Support Revenue Growth, FCF Margins For Nearly A Decade, Analyst SaysBuddhist Monks In Thailand Test Positive For Meth, Leaving Temple Empty As They Go To RehabDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

But she had little choice, with home prices rising as well, which made her feel like saving the money for a mortgage down payment would take her a long time-or not be possible at all.Maya works for a local bank and is also attending cosmetology school. She hopes her son will be inspired by her determination to provide him with a better life. She dreams of one day owning a business and believes living in an affordable home will allow her the stability to keep working toward that and all of her other goals.After hearing about Habitat for Humanity of Greater Nashville's home ownership program, Maya applied and was relieved to be accepted. She completed 100 hours of financial and homeowner education classes, working 70 hours building alongside sponsors and volunteers, and volunteered 30 hours at the Habitat ReStore. After all of this hard work and ""sweat equity,"" Maya finally moved into her own brand new home in May, with a 0 percent APR mortgage.Maya's family is rooted in Dickson, and she loves the close-knit community in the area. One of her favorite memories is watching her 2-year-old son play outside her parents' home. This memory made her long to give her son his own yard to play in. Now, with the help of Habitat for Humanity and Whirlpool Corp., she has that yard, as well as a new home for her son to create his own childhood memories in.""Growing up, we spent a lot of family time in our living room. My family would get together on holidays, and I am excited to have that in my new home for my own son,"" she says, smiling.Maya's new home in Dickson was built as part of Habitat for Humanity's BuildBetter with Whirlpool initiative, an expansion of Habitat's existing BuildBetter program that will build more than 250 climate-resilient and energy-efficient homes that will help hundreds of families in need of affordable housing over the next three years.Story continuesHer new three-bedroom home has low-flow shower heads, sinks, faucets and toilets - using 31 percent less water than regular fixtures. It has a 50-gallon electric water heater with 93 percent efficiency, double-paned windows for better insulation, and a strengthened roof. The house is 100 percent ENERGY STAR certified. The family also received an energy-efficient refrigerator and range, which Whirlpool Corporation donates to every Habitat-built home in North America.""To have new appliances - up-to-date appliances at that - feels amazing,"" Maya says. ""It's a big contrast coming from a home where the fridge was not fully freezing and there was no dishwasher. I now have new appliances that are utilized daily. My son and I appreciate everything Whirlpool has done and will continue to do through Habitat for people like me.""Maya is grateful for the support she received as she attained home ownership.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Technology Select Sector Diamondback Energy FANG, Chevron CVX, ConocoPhillips COP, Transocean RIG and Enbridge ENB.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Oil &amp; Gas Stock Roundup: Spotlight on Deals by Diamondback, ChevronIt was a week when oil prices moved down while natural gas futures registered an increase.On the news front, shale driller Diamondback Energy agreed to acquire Midland Basin operator Lario Oil &amp; Gas for a mixture of stock and cash, while energy giant Chevron disclosed the buyout of energy solutions firm Beyond6, together with its compressed natural gas (CNG) stations. Developments associated with ConocoPhillips, Transocean and Enbridge also made it to the headlines.Overall, it was a mixed seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost some 4.8% to close at $76.28 per barrel, while natural gas prices increased around 11.4% to end at $7.0240 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).Coming back to the holiday-shortened week ended Oct 25, the oil price action continued to be bearish in the United States, weighed by China's economic slowdown due to the continuation of its zero-COVID lockdown policy. The slower-than-expected effect of Western sanctions on Russian crude export has also been a major factor.Meanwhile, natural gas finished up for the third straight week following the first draw of the winter heating season and strong temperature-driven consumption.Recap of the Week's Most Important Stories1.  Diamondback Energy — the Midland, TX-headquartered independent oil and gas exploration &amp; production company — declared that it has agreed to acquire all leasehold and related assets in the Permian Basin from Lario Oil &amp; Gas in cash and stock.Story continuesPer the terms of the deal, which is anticipated to be closed on Jan 31, 2023, Lario will receive 4.18 million Diamondback shares and $850 million as cash consideration.The acquisition includes about 25,000 gross (15,000 net) acres in the core of the Northern Midland Basin, with the full-year 2023 estimated average production of roughly 25 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Moreover, FANG expects to reduce the operated rig count from two currently to one or less post-closing for 2023 development. (Diamondback to Buy Permian Basin Assets From Lario)2. Supermajor Chevron recently announced that it signed a definitive agreement to take over full ownership of Beyond6, LLC and its network of 55 compressed natural gas (CNG) stations spread across the United States. CVX is acquiring ownership from Beyond6's current co-owners — Mercuria Energy Trading and CEO Andrew West. The financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.As part of the transaction, Mercuria will enter a long-term supply relationship to deliver renewable natural gas (RNG) to Chevron. This will enable CVX to market the RNG it either produces or procures through a nationwide network of CNG locations.Chevron mentioned that this acquisition of Beyond6 complements the energy giant's strength in its traditional product business with new offerings. These will assist customers in supporting a lower carbon future, of which RNG is an essential part of the company's portfolio of solutions.

The project is co-owned by EDF Renewables and CPP Investments.Located 12-20 kilometers off France's west coast, the 480-MW Saint-Nazaire wind farm involves 80 turbines at depths of 12-25 meters. The offshore wind farm can power an equivalent of 400,000 homes per year or 20% of the Loire-Atlantique region's electricity requirements.

The Energy Select Sector SPDR — a popular way to track energy companies — edged up 0.3% last week. Over the past six months, the sector tracker has risen 4.2%.What's Next in the Energy World?Following last week's mixed fortunes for oil and gas, market participants will closely track the regular releases to look for further guidance on the direction of prices. In this context, the U.S. government's statistics on oil and natural gas — one of the few solid indicators that come out regularly — will be on energy traders' radar.Data on rig count from the oilfield service firm Baker Hughes, which is a pointer to the trends in U.S. crude/natural gas production, is closely followed too. News related to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict and the potential demand loss from the continued coronavirus lockdowns in China will be the other factors that will dictate the near-term price movement of the commodities.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

This endeavor is part of Audi’s PlasticLoop project and helps close the loop for recycling automotive plastic waste into new parts. The alliance will help reduce the fossil-based primary materials required for Audi Q8 e-tron’s manufacturing. Moreover, the collaboration keeps valuable feedstocks in a circular loop. The irreparable plastic components from customer vehicles are chemically recycled into pyrolysis oil. Further, to produce new polymers, LyondellBasell uses this pyrolysis oil as a raw material instead of virgin fossil feedstocks to manufacture new plastics. These recycled materials are then used in the Audi product. There’s no distinctive difference between materials produced from pyrolysis oil and those from virgin materials. Both possess the same quality and properties. Applying this method, LyondellBasell, Audi and the chemical recycler SynCycle could achieve the recycling of a stream of material that was hitherto mainly suitable for energy recovery. This will be the first time that LYB will use chemical recycling to reprocess mixed automotive plastic waste and use it to create plastic content for automotive interior applications. In the third quarter, inflation, high-energy costs and softer seasonal demand posed difficulties for LYB. However, demand for its products used in consumer packaging remained stable. Management stated that LYB’s diverse business portfolio, strong balance sheet and solid liquidity are enabling it to navigate the market turbulences. LyondellBasell posted revenues of $12.25 billion for the third quarter of 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.7%. This also compares unfavorably with the year-ago revenues of $12.7 billion. Quarterly earnings were reported at $1.96 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.96. The year-ago quarter’s adjusted earnings were reported to be $5.25 per share.Story continues The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LyondellBasell’s current-year revenues is pegged at $50.87 billion, indicating 10.2% growth from the year-ago actuals. The same for earnings is pegged at $12.32 per share, suggesting a 32.3% decline from the prior-year reading. LYB’s trailing four-quarter average surprise is negative 5%.Price PerformanceShares of LyondellBasell have dipped 2.6% in the past year compared with the 0.8% decline of the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderLyondellBasell currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space include Bunge Limited BG, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A.

371,2c13628d-94cb-3ac7-b835-3abf7932b67d,VLO,2022-12-01,Valero Energy (VLO) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-vlo-incredible-growth-174505866.html,1669830305,STORY,['VLO'],"[Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Valero Energy (VLO) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this oil refiner a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Valero Energy is 4.6%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 909.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 270.4%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Valero Energy has an S/TA ratio of 2.82, which means that the company gets $2.82 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 2.36, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Valero Energy looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 53.3% this year versus the industry average of 52.3%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Valero Energy. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2.2% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Valero Energy a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Valero Energy well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Valero Energy (VLO) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Valero Energy currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.36, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 11 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.36 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 11 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy, representing 81.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for VLOBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for VLOCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Valero Energy here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Valero Energy, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is VLO Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Valero Energy, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 2.2% over the past month to $28.37.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Valero Energy. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Valero Energy may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

373,011bb1a9-10da-3c4d-b5da-fada4b7a7d64,UNH,2022-12-01,Here's What To Make Of UnitedHealth Group's (NYSE:UNH) Decelerating Rates Of Return,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-unitedhealth-groups-nyse-unh-120024018.html,1669896024,STORY,['UNH'],"[If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for UnitedHealth Group:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.19 = US$27b ÷ (US$243b - US$101b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, UnitedHealth Group has an ROCE of 19%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 10% generated by the Healthcare industry. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group roceIn the above chart we have measured UnitedHealth Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering UnitedHealth Group here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEWhile the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has consistently earned 19% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 72% in that time. Since 19% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesAnother thing to note, UnitedHealth Group has a high ratio of current liabilities to total assets of 42%. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.In Conclusion...To sum it up, UnitedHealth Group has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 167% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.If you're still interested in UnitedHealth Group it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.While UnitedHealth Group isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

374,1432f993-e05e-3a96-8052-9838353fbec9,UNH,2022-12-01,UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-group-incorporated-unh-attracting-140002835.html,1669816802,STORY,['UNH'],"[UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned -3.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, which UnitedHealth falls in, has lost 4.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $5.16 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $22.01 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +15.7%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.89 indicates a change of +13.1% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UnitedHealth is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UNH _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate of $81.65 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.7%. The $323.07 billion and $357.59 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +12.3% and +10.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $80.89 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.8%. EPS of $5.79 for the same period compares with $4.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $80.72 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.21%. The EPS surprise was +6.24%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

375,6b181cd4-14e6-3f87-bd64-0c3829c2df23,UNH,2022-12-01,David Tepper Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/david-tepper-stock-portfolio-top-133736681.html,1669815456,STORY,['UNH'],"[In this article we delve into the David Tepper Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks. Click to skip ahead to the David Tepper Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are some of the top stock picks of billionaire money manager and Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper.David Tepper co-founded the Miami Beach, Florida-based hedge fund Appaloosa Management in 1993. Tepper earned a Bachelor of Arts in economics from the University of Pittsburgh and later an MBA from Carnegie Mellon’s business school, which was named after him in 2004. He worked as a credit analyst with Goldman Sachs for seven years, specializing in distressed debt, before leaving the firm in 1992 and launching his own fund a year later.Appaloosa has been one of the best performing hedge funds in the world since inception, generating annualized returns of about 25% through 2018 and elevating Tepper to billionaire status more than a decade prior to that. Tepper’s net worth is currently estimated by Forbes at $15.4 billion, ranking him the 98th richest person in the world.Tepper, who is in the process of closing his firm to outside money and converting Appaloosa into a family office, has taken a bearish stance on equities in recent quarters. His fund’s 13F AUM has declined for six straight quarters, including by 59% during the first half of 2022. Considering 70% of the firm's assets were in-house as of 2020, returning money to shareholdersThat bearish stance persisted in Q3, as Tepper’s fund didn’t make a single addition to its 13F portfolio or even increase the size of any of its existing holdings. On the other hand, it sold off eight of its former holdings and reduced the size of 12 other holdings. All told, Appaloosa’s 13F AUM stood at just $1.36 billion at the end of Q3, down from $6.96 billion at the end of Q1 2021.Appaloosa remained heavily invested in communications and consumer discretionary stocks, while utilities and telecommunications stocks jumped to the highest weighting in its 13F portfolio. It’s also the greatest exposure Appaloosa’s 13F portfolio has had to telecommunications stocks since 2003. Energy stocks also had double-digit weighting in Appaloosa’s 13F portfolio for the seventh straight quarter.Story continuesIn this article, we’ll take a look at the stocks that David Tepper has maintained the strongest conviction in while his overall market outlook continues to be decidedly bearish.David Tepper Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock PicksOur MethodologyThe following data is gathered from Appaloosa Management’s latest 13F filing with the SEC. We follow hedge funds like Appaloosa Management because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q3 2022 reporting period.David Tepper Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks10. Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR)Value of Appaloosa Management‘s 13F Position: $32.8 Million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 65 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are a few of the prominent holdings in David Tepper’s stock portfolio. Also cracking the top 10 is Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR), one of several energy companies that Tepper is bullish on. He trimmed the size of several of those holdings during Q3, including AR, which was cut by 13% to 1.25 million shares.Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR) trailing twelve month (TTM) revenue has soared to $8.4 billion compared to just $3.08 billion in 2020. Thanks to the natural gas company’s cost of revenue rising only marginally during that time, its gross profit has soared from negative $514 million in 2020 to $4.73 billion over the TTM period. Jefferies analyst Lloyd Byrne has a ‘Buy’ rating and $47 price target on AR, noting that the option value on energy stocks is up again and could stay higher for longer without the need for added investment.Hedge fund ownership of Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE:AR) rose for eight straight quarters through Q2, tripling during that time and hitting an all-time high before dipping slightly in Q3. D E Shaw, Two Sigma Advisors, and Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management are some of the biggest shareholders of Antero Resources.9. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Value of Appaloosa Management‘s 13F Position: $54.7 Million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 272 David Tepper trimmed his fund’s Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) holding by 6% during Q3 to 235,000 shares. Microsoft is in a dead heat with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) (another favored stock of Tepper’s) as the single most popular ticker among hedge funds. No fewer than 250 funds have been long MSFT each quarter over the past two years. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, managed by Michael Larson, is the largest Microsoft shareholder among the select group of funds tracked by Insider Monkey.Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares are down by 28% this year and a weakening PC market is cause for minor concern, with the company’s More Personal Computing segment contracting slightly in Q1 of Microsoft’s fiscal year (FY) 2023. The company’s other segments continue to steam ahead though regardless of the broader economic conditions, as intelligent cloud revenue grew by 20% year-over-year and overall operating income was up by 6% to $21.5 billion. Microsoft is also a major free cash flow (FCF) machine, topping $63 billion in FCF over the past year.Carillon Tower also believes Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is performing well in spite of what the stock market might lead you to believe, as noted in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Despite reporting very good quarterly results, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) underperformed the overall market in August. Technology stocks in general underperformed in August due to fears over slowing global economic growth, potentially leading to cuts in corporate information technology budgets.”8. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) Value of Appaloosa Management‘s 13F Position: $75.8 Million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 112 David Tepper’s position in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) was left unchanged during Q3 at an even 150,000 shares. The billionaire money manager sold off 29,000 UNH shares during the first half of 2022. United Health hit an all-time high in hedge fund ownership during Q3 after a 16% jump in the number of funds long UNH during the quarter. Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global and Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management were among the funds that added UNH to their 13F portfolios during Q3.Healthcare is a relatively safe industry to invest in during a recession, as most people are not willing to compromise their health and avoid having necessary surgical procedures or other interventions carried out regardless of their economic health. If anything, and especially given the rising costs associated with healthcare, it will make people increasingly more willing to invest in health insurance. That’s evidenced by the strong performance of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), which has grown revenue by 14% year-over-year through the first nine months of 2022. The company’s EPS is also projected to rise by about 16% this year to $20.95 at the midpoint of the health insurer’s guidance range.Distillate Capital still likes UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)’s valuation even after the stock has greatly outperformed the market this year, as the fund stated in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“UnitedHealth Group was among the 2 largest trims at around 1% each. Each stock was up 1% in the quarter compared to the 16% price decline for the S&amp;P 500 and the positions were reduced as the valuations became somewhat less appealing, though still attractive enough to warrant inclusion.”7. Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M)Value of Appaloosa Management‘s 13F Position: $94 Million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 31 Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M) had been a top five stock pick of Tepper’s for several quarters until Q3, when the stock’s underperformance dropped it to the seventh-most valuable holding in his 13F portfolio. The position was left unchanged during the third quarter at an even 6 million shares, but lost $15 million of its value after shares fell by 14.5%. Numerous other funds bailed on Macy’s during Q3, as there was a 24% drop in ownership of the stock.Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M) has been a big winner for Tepper so far in Q4, with shares gaining close to 50%. The fashion retailer’s faltering sales growth has been driving off many investors, as same-store sales slumped by 1.5% yeae-over-year in Q2, which then accelerated to a 3% decline in Q3. The company does have some positives going for it though which could be enticing Tepper.Among other things, it’s done a good job managing its inventory levels ahead of the holiday season, an issue that has been plaguing numerous other retailers. That should ensure that Macy’s delivers solid profits during the holiday quarter, with the company raising its 2022 adjusted EPS forecast by $0.07 following the release of its Q3 results. Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M) also pays out an attractive dividend that currently yields 2.7%.6. EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT)Value of Appaloosa Management‘s 13F Position: $103 Million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 57 Closing out the first half of David Tepper’s stock portfolio is EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT), a holding which Tepper trimmed by 12% during Q3 to 2.53 million shares. Hedge fund ownership of EQT has risen for three straight quarters, climbing by 24% during that time. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital and Louis Navellier’s Navellier &amp; Associates were some of the funds to add EQT to their 13F portfolios during the third quarter.EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) is another energy company Tepper likes which has had blowout results in this year. EQT’s TTM revenue has skyrocketed to $12.4 billion from just $2.66 billion in 2020. TTM gross profit has hit $8.2 billion, compared to a loss of $627 million two years ago. Piper Sandler analyst Mark Lear has an ‘Overweight’ rating on EQT and raised his price target on the stock to $63 from $62 earlier this month, but notes that the industry’s capex could rise in the final quarter of this year and into 2023 given growing service costs.ClearBridge Investments Mid Cap Strategy is bullish on EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT)’s position in the natural gas space, as relayed in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also added natural gas company EQT (NYSE:EQT) in the energy sector. As one of the lowest-cost domestic producers, EQT stands to benefit from its position as a leading supplier of natural gas to a world suffering from critically low energy reserves. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and threats to hold natural gas exports hostage have spurred a surge in European energy prices, generating long-term agreements by European countries to purchase U.S. natural gas.This strong demand and elevated prices have helped EQT strengthen its balance sheet and position it to take advantage as opportunities emerge for natural gas to plug the gaps in the global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables.”See where Amazon.com, Inc.

For what to expect here, let's bring in Yahoo Finance Fed correspondent Jen Schonberger. Jen?JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: Good morning, Brian. Fed Chair Powell slated to speak this afternoon in what will be his last remarks before the Federal Reserve's policy meeting in two weeks, where officials are expected to slow down the pace of rate hikes to 50 basis points from a blistering rate of 75 basis points for the past four meetings. Now, Powell is expected to talk about the economic outlook and the health of the job market when he speaks at the Brookings Institution here in Washington.Powell likely to repeat that the job market is very strong and probably too tight to bring down inflation. He will likely reiterate that the Fed will slow down the pace of rate hikes to account for the time it takes for higher rates to filter through the economy. But he will also likely say that the Fed will raise rates higher than projected in September and hold them at higher levels for longer, given how sticky inflation has continued to be and even with nascent signs of cooling.Now the Fed will get a read on its favorite inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures index, Thursday, and another reading on the consumer price index in December, right before its meeting. And high inflation not just a US story but a global story. Inflation in the eurozone fell in November for the first time since the middle of last year, as energy prices dropped.But economists warn that isn't likely to stop the European Central Bank from increasing interest rates further. Consumer prices still rose 10% in November, though, down from 10.6% in October. Guys.BRAD SMITH: All right, thanks so much. Jen Schonberger breaking that down for us. Well, you've really teed up the conversation here. Let's talk a little bit more about the Fed because we've got a ton of Fed speak that's come over the past two weeks as well. We heard from Bullard yesterday as well, talking about how long we could be in this particular kind of era where the Fed is slowly raising interest rates. And particularly what he had pointed out was that we may have to stay here all during 2023 and even into 2024. That, of course, is catching some of the markets here off guard. But for Bullard, who has been a little bit more hawkish in his tone, it shouldn't be too much of a surprise here.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and really the central question here is, where does inflation come from, right? What is the source of inflation? Is it demand driven? Is it supply driven? Is it both? And the San Francisco Federal Reserve actually just did a survey on this, a study of this, and the conclusion is it's really hard to tell at various times. You see the ambiguous inflation feed there. That is the orange line-- that it's difficult to tell which of these it came from. If it's demand-driven inflation, that's something the Fed can in theory affect, right?If they raise interest rates, in theory, that suppresses demand and eventually brings down prices. If it's supply shocks, like we saw during the pandemic, that's a lot less something a lever that the Federal Reserve can push on. So kind of interesting here as we get to this point, and as we do look at some of the demand drivers coming down a little bit, how this is going to play out and how the Fed's going to read this.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, for those, I think, logging on right now to our platform, checking their portfolios and various ticker pages, I will say this, it's hard to handicap what the market reaction could be here. And I just got a note from Jan Hatzius, the chief economist over at Goldman Sachs. And he notes this-- Powell's likely to hint that the FOMC will slow the pace of rate hikes at the December meeting but push back against the recent easing in financial conditions with two hawkish counterpoints. So it's tough. So on one hand, Powell may say, you know what, we might be slowing the rate hikes but maybe not as much as the market has expected the past-- the past month or so.BRAD SMITH: And one of the other factors that also kind of goes into that inflation picture that we were looking at is how much people are getting paid too. We had seen that within the ADP report here, as the year-over-year pay, the median change in annual pay, that actually went up by about 7.6%.So even if you do have the number of jobs that are being added, pulling back there in some very specific categories that we could break down in a hot second, but the pay, I think, staying elevated and continuing to move higher, if you do have a higher wage that employees are getting and then still being willing to spend to a certain extent as well, then that too is another inflationary factor that we have to consider.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and we saw some big divergences sector-wise in this ADP report. Manufacturing jobs down 100,000 in this report. We saw a contraction in construction jobs of 2,000. And then when we talk about all of these layoffs that have been going on-- and by the way, a report today that DoorDash is laying off a little more than 1,200 of the employees in its corporate office. So where are all those tech employees, right? It looks like that they are spread between a couple of different areas.There's an information category in ADP that saw a drop of 25,000. And then there's professional and business services. Like, if you're an executive, a sales exec at DoorDash, maybe you're in that category instead of in the information category. I don't know. But that saw a drop of 77,000. So we are seeing that-- the pullback that we've been talking about in tech hiring. That's where it looks like it's showing up.BRIAN SOZZI: This one bothers me. I will say it quickly on DoorDash, because here's a company that has done well the past year, now following other tech companies that have not done well in laying people off. So it really makes me a little concerned of where we are in the economy but also very curious of what DoorDash is seeing in its business in the fourth quarter.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, given the number of tech layoffs specifically that we have seen, keep a close eye on that professional and business services category. You think back to Meta and how many people they laid off-- 11,000. That certainly is going to be one of the kind of more-- the larger data points to continue to track, even as we get into the BLS statistics too.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, we did just see DoorDash shares trading higher, so it looks like people aren't too worried by this signal. But that's a good point that you make there.]"

The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. NRDC wants the SEC, the main U.S. markets regulator, to consider appropriate enforcement action or require P&amp;G to update its statements to investors.P&amp;G said in September that for every tree used, at least two are re-grown, and that it uses satellite monitoring and audits to check on its forest sourcing.The environmental group also said that P&amp;G's claims are concerning because some investors take into consideration how the company ranks compared to its peers on its environment-related actions.NRDC also said that P&amp;G is overly reliant on third-party certifications for the sustainability of its wood pulp supply chain.NRDC recently encouraged shareholders to vote against CEO Jon Moeller and two directors, Angela Braly and Patricia Woertz, at P&amp;G's annual meeting. The directors and CEO were all voted in last month with more than 90% support. (Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli in New York)]"

This performance momentum has been underpinned by a history of outperformance, with the recent strong Q3 report the 10th straight quarter of better-than-expected top and bottom line results. Sales improved year over year driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments.Improved productivity amid cost headwinds has also aided the results. It witnessed SG&amp;A expense leverage, owing to savings from overhead and marketing expenses, and cost leverage gains due to higher sales and real estate.However, commodity cost inflation, increase in freight costs, product and packaging investments and other impacts hurt margins. Also, it issued a drab fiscal 2023 view due to inflation, higher freight and currency woes.(You can read the full research report on Procter &amp; Gamble here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Coca-Cola shares have gained +14.9% over the past year, modestly outperforming Pepsi at +12% and doing significantly better than the S&amp;P 500 index at -16.4%. Its top and bottom lines surpassed estimates for the seventh straight quarter in Q3. The company's results benefited from the continued momentum from the first half of 2022. Sales gained from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and an increase in concentrate sales.Coca-Cola benefited from underlying share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels. It raised the organic revenues and comparable earnings per share growth guidance for 2022. It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments.However, pressures from higher supply chain costs, including transportation and input costs remain.

The company continues to gain on higher premiums, given its compelling product portfolio, leadership position and strength in both Vehicle and Property businesses.Focus on becoming a one-stop insurance destination, catering to customers opting for a combination of home and auto insurance, augurs well for the company's growth. Policies in force and retention ratio should remain healthy. Competitive pricing to retain current customers and address customer needs with new offerings should continue to drive policy life expectancy.However, exposure to catastrophe losses induces underwriting volatility. Escalating expenses due to higher losses and settlement expenses remain an overhang on the company's margin.

Shares have added about 9.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Vornado due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Vornado’s FFO and Revenues Surpass Estimates in Q3Vornado’s third-quarter 2022 FFO plus assumed conversions as adjusted per share of 81 cents topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 74 cents.Results displayed better-than-anticipated top-line growth. Healthy leasing activity was witnessed across all portfolios.Total revenues came in at $457.4 million in the reported quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $439.1 million.On a year-over-year basis, FFO per share and revenues improved by 14.1% and 11.8%, respectively.Behind the HeadlinesIn the reported quarter, total same-store NOI (at share) improved 11.7% year over year. While the metric at theMART increased significantly, the same for the 555 California Street portfolio grew 1.3%.

The tenant improvements and leasing commissions were $16.21 per square foot per annum, or 18.2% of the initial rent.In the New York retail portfolio, 62,000 square feet were leased (57,000 square feet at share) at an initial rent of $242.89 per square foot and a weighted average lease term of 10.5 years. The tenant improvements and leasing commissions were $17.96 per square foot per annum, or 7.4% of the initial rent.Additionally, at theMART 67,000 square feet of space (all at share) was leased for an initial rent of $52.20 per square foot and a weighted average lease term of 7.3 years. The tenant improvements and leasing commissions were $11.64 per square foot per annum, or 22.3% of the initial rent.For VNO’s 555 California Street portfolio, 154,000 square feet of space (108,000 square feet at share) was leased for an initial rent of $98.20 per square foot and a weighted average lease term of 5.6 years. The tenant improvements and leasing commissions were $4.73 per square foot per annum, or 4.8% of the initial rent.Vornado ended the quarter with occupancy in the New York portfolio at 90.3%, down 10 basis points (bps) year over year. Occupancy in theMART declined 230 bps from the prior year period to 87.3%, while occupancy in 555 California Street fell 340 bps to 94.7%.On Aug 17, 2022, Vornado entered into an agreement to sell 40 Fulton Street for $102 million. The sale of this 251,000 square feet Manhattan office and retail building is likely to be completed in fourth-quarter 2022. The company expects to recognize a net gain of $33 million from the disposition.Story continuesBalance SheetVornado exited third-quarter 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $845.4 million, down from $988.4 million as of Jun 30, 2022.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresCurrently, Vornado has a subpar Growth Score of D, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerVornado belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry.

387,2192b794-9dcf-3ab5-aab4-648454f5066b,AAL,2022-12-01,Why Booking Directly With Airlines Can Be More Expensive,NerdWallet,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-booking-directly-airlines-more-162745627.html,1669825665,STORY,['AAL'],"[Early in the pandemic, many travelers experienced headaches while trying to rebook air travel purchased through third parties such as Orbitz and Kayak. Overloaded customer service centers and constantly changing airline policies resulted in a big mess at these agencies, prompting many travelers to book directly through the airline to avoid future issues.Yet as the dust settles on the pandemic and travel begins to return to normal, air passengers are experiencing a different reality: Booking directly through airlines involves navigating a maze of fees, add-on offers and confusing seat selection choices. The resulting price at checkout is often higher — much higher — than the advertised price.The issue has become so problematic that even President Biden has joined the fray. “You should know the full cost of your ticket, right when you’re comparison shopping,” he said in a press conference announcing a new Department of Transportation initiative to force airlines to disclose these fees. “So you can pick the ticket that is actually the best deal for you.”Efforts to rein in airline fees are nothing new. The Obama administration tried and failed to enact similar regulations. And until meaningful changes are made, airline customers will be the ones footing the bill, especially if they use the airlines’ own websites and apps to make their purchases.The fee eraSince the rise of budget airlines such as Spirit and Frontier, U.S. airlines have dramatically shifted how they make money. Rather than earning profit margin on airfare itself, which is highly competitive, airlines are increasingly focused on “ancillary revenue” from add-on fees, credit card rewards programs and seat upgrades.Between 2019 and 2021, ancillary fees as a percentage of total revenue for major U.S. airlines jumped six percentage points, from 16.1% to 22.2%, according to a report by IdeaWorksCompany, an airline industry reporting firm. That follows a steady drumbeat of increased fee revenue going back to at least 2007.Story continuesThe upshot for customers: Saving money on air travel depends less on the base cost of the ticket itself and more on the add-ons avoided while checking out. Some of these add-ons, such as fees for carry-on bags, are relatively simple to avoid, while others, such as the difference between basic economy and regular economy (or “main cabin”), can be far more complex decisions.Mismatched prioritiesAirlines want customers to book through their own websites and apps for a simple reason: They tend to spend more money on ancillary fees. In a Security and Exchange Commission filing, American Airlines made this preference clear, citing its dependence on third parties such as online travel agencies as a potential risk factor.“We are also dependent upon the ability and willingness of these distribution channels to expand their ability to distribute and collect revenues for ancillary products (e.g., fees for selective seating),” the filing read.Basically, American Airlines admits that it makes a lot of money from ancillary fees, and is worried that third-party sellers won’t push these fees as aggressively as it does. And this mismatch is exactly what provides an opportunity for savvy customers.Third-party services have an incentive to clarify rather than obscure these choices for customers, explained Melanie Fish, a spokesperson for Expedia, a third-party travel booking platform.“When shopping for flights in the app, travelers can select a fare and see what’s included by the airline in the ticket price, such as seat selection, cancellations or changes, as well as the cost for checked baggage, if applicable,” Fish said by email.The choice between basic economy and main cabin fares offers an example of how airlines’ interests are mismatched with those of their customers. Airlines want to promote lower basic economy fares in search results and then persuade shoppers to upgrade to more expensive main cabin fares during checkout. This not only increases the cost of the ticket, but makes comparison shopping difficult. Online travel agencies can clarify these differences and save customers money.“Travelers can scroll through the various available fare choices such as basic economy, economy, etc., and view all the options, costs or add-ons side-by-side, making it easy to select the best fare for their needs,” Fish explained.Of course, online travel agencies have their own incentives to add on extra charges, like rental cars or trip protection. So customers should still be wary of add-on costs, even when booking through these platforms. But while airlines continue to push ancillary fees and travel booking platforms have more incentive to show you the costs of flights upfront in their search results, travelers can save money by booking through third parties.This article was written by NerdWallet and was originally published by The Associated Press.

389,6e1fab77-d29d-30d0-8dd0-541ccc064f53,PFG,2022-12-01,Our 7 Top Stock Picks for December 2022,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-top-stock-picks-december-181342480.html,1669572822,STORY,"['OXY', 'ALGN', '^GSPC', 'PDCE', 'CCRN', 'GOGO', 'PFG', 'MATX']","[I’m tasked with providing readers with some of the final top stock picks of the year.It’s been brutal for some S&amp;P 500 stocks in 2022. Align Technology (NASDAQ:ALGN) has lost nearly 70% of its value, while others such as Warren Buffet’s big play, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), is up nearly 130% heading into December. Thus, plenty of stocks are doing just fine. Notably, the S&amp;P 500 has been moving higher, up approximately 6% in the past month. Thus, investors are trying to figure out whether the rally can last into 2023. The S&amp;P Composite 1500 is up more than the S&amp;P 500 in the past month, and down a tiny fraction less, on a year-to-date basis.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsI’ll use the S&amp;P 1500 as my selection group for the top stocks for December 2022. Stocks qualify for this index with a minimum market capitalization of $1 billion, high earnings yields (low price-earnings ratios) and high returns on invested capital. And as always, I’ll diversify my top stock picks across seven different sectors.Happy Holidays. GOGOGogo$15.85GRBKGreen Brick Partners$24.42PDCEPDC Energy$75.41PFGPrincipal Financial Group$92.47CCRNCross Country Healthcare$35.32MATXMatson$64.31LPXLousiana-Pacific$62.82Gogo (GOGO)rural broadband: a cell phone tower over a long stretch of hills and forestSource: Steve Heap / ShutterstockStarting off our list of top stock picks worth considering in this current market, we have Gogo (NASDAQ:GOGO).If you’re unfamiliar with Gogo, this company provides broadband connectivity services for the business aviation market. The company’s Avance L5 and LG systems are installed in 3,079 aircraft, with the company’s ATG systems in 6,777 aircraft, and its narrowband satellite connectivity installed in 4,484 aircraft. While Gogo’s business is financially having an excellent year, its stock has been on a rollercoaster. GOGO stock is up more than 17% year-to-date. However, in April this stock traded close to $25, and near a low of $11 in October. Story continuesThankfully, the company reported record third quarter results in early November. As a result, its shares have gained more than 12% over the past month. On the top line, Gogo’s revenues rose 11% in the third quarter, to $105.3 million, while its operating income increased by 18% to $36.3 million. That’s a healthy 34% operating margin. In 2022, Gogo expects free cash flow of $55 million at the midpoint of its guidance. By 2025, its free cash flow should grow to $200 million. GOGO’s enterprise value is $2.65 billion, 16.9x EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). That’s half its five-year average multiple.Green Brick Partners (GRBK)A photo of a man with a clipboard in front of a home under construction.Source: Shutterstock.comIn March, I wrote about seven holdings of billionaire hedge fund owner David Einhorn. One of those names was Green Brick Partners (NYSE:GRBK). This was certainly among the top stock picks at the time, having gained 48% in Q4 2021 alone. The hedge fund partnered with long-time homebuilding veteran Jim Brickman in 2009. Green Brick went public five years later. I said something proactive at the time of the article’s publication (Mar. 2): “As long as the housing business remains strong, GRBK is a lock to keep moving higher in 2022 and beyond.” At the time, new home sales were just starting to turn negative. In December 2021, there were 839,000 new homes sold. This number dropped to 831,000 at the end of January, and 790,000 at the end of February. Home sales continued dropping in March and April before turning higher in May. After that, it’s been up and down ever since.As for Green Brick stock, it’s down 16%, identical to the S&amp;P 500. The company’s financials were still healthy as of Sept. 30. Revenues were up 19.2% year-over-year to $407.9 million, with a record homebuilding gross margin of 32.4%. This impressive gross margin was 550 basis points higher than Q3 2021, and likely higher than most publicly-traded homebuilders.“Our strong balance sheet with a 28.0% debt-to-total capital ratio and record gross margins gives Green Brick more flexibility than most peers to effectively manage pace versus price decisions going forward. We view the current challenges as a potential opportunity to increase market share,” said CEO Jim Brickman in its Q3 2022 press release.Long-term, I like this company’s chances. PDC Energy (PDCE)a bunch of oil barrels are stacked highSource: ShutterstockThis isn’t the first time I’ve picked PDC Energy (NASDAQ:PDCE) in 2022. Most recently, I suggested that the Colorado and West Texas oil and gas producer could be a buyout target. Interestingly, if you look at the long-term chart for PDCE stock, it’s hit or been near $80 on three occasions since 2000. The first was May 2008, followed by December 2016, and then April 2022. In both cases where the floor gave out, shares traded near single digits.So, if you were to buy, you’d want a quick trigger, or a plan to average down to the bottom. But, in the end, you will make money holding this stock.  The 14 analysts that cover its stock give it an average rating of overweight with a $97.50 target price, 30% higher than where it’s currently trading. PDC reported Q3 2022 results that included revenues of $1.51 billion, $440 million in adjusted free cash flow, total production of 250,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d), and $300 million in debt repayment. In Q4 2022, it expects to produce 235,000 Boe/d. Its capital investments for the entire year are expected to be $1.08 billion. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months ended Sept. 30 were $1.66 billion [key ratios]. Based on a market cap of $6.9 billion, the company’s free cash flow yield is 24.0%. I consider anything above 8% to put a company in value territory.  Principal Financial Group (PFG)A pink piggy bank wearing a grad cap sits on a wooden table in front of a chalkboard.Source: ShutterstockOf the 70 financial stocks in the S&amp;P 500, Principal Financial Group (NASDAQ:PFG) has the fourth-best performance in 2022, up more than 25% year-to-date. It’s gained more than 14% in the past month alone.If you’re unfamiliar with the company, it does three things well:It offers variable annuities and life insurance products to the business and business-owner market.It is one of the largest providers of retirement solutions in the U.S.It is a provider of global asset management services to sophisticated investors worldwide. In 2021, the company began a transformation to better serve its customers. It did so, not because its business was failing, but rather to stay ahead of the competition.“While we’re transforming important aspects of our business, our core strengths remain unchanged,” Principal CEO Dan Houston stated in its 2021 annual report. “Our global, diversified business model sets us apart and weathers a variety of economic conditions. Our stronger focus has sharpened the interplay and interdependencies of our businesses, generating additional value.”Investors are buying its plan. In Q3 2022, Principal’s trailing 12-month pre-tax operating earnings were $2.19 billion, 3.3% higher than in the same period a year earlier. In addition, its book value per share at the end of September, excluding AOCI (accumulated other comprehensive income) was $50.55, 2.6% higher than at the end of 2021.Can it keep moving higher in December? While it’s going to be tough given the current economic uncertainty, and it’s trading near an all-time high, PFG stock provides a reasonably good dividend yield of 2.8% to keep you happy if it doesn’t move in the year’s final month. Cross Country Healthcare (CCRN)dividendsSource: ShutterstockCross Country Healthcare’s (NASDAQ:CCRN) primary revenue generator is nurse staffing for hospitals and other healthcare facilties.This segment of the Florida-based workforce solutions and advisory firm accounted for 96% of its $636.1 million in Q3 2022 revenue. Physician staffing accounts for the remainder. Notably, nurse staffing accounts for 98% of its contribution margin.The company’s largest single source of revenue comes from its managed service programs (MSPs). These programs accounted for 55% of its overall revenue in the third quarter. Since 2019, the annualized contingent labor spend by the MSPs it manages has increased four-fold to $2 billion. In the second quarter, the company launched Intellify, its proprietary cloud-based Vendor Management System (VMS). Intellify will be used for new and existing MSP clients. Technology solutions such as Intellify will help its clients manage their healthcare spend. As of October, Cross Country had 10 MSPs live on Intellify with five more deployments planned by the end of the year. Intellify is expected to save clients millions annually. It will be deployed to all its existing clients within 18 months.The seven analysts who cover this stock give it an overweight rating with a $39.33 target price. CCRN stock is up nearly 27% year-to-date, and is one of the top stock picks on my list for good reason.Matson (MATX)A large ULCV container ship underway, sails on open water fully loaded with containers and cargo - the ZIM San FranciscoSource: ImagineStock / Shutterstock.comIf you’ve got product to ship to or from Asia, Matson (NYSE:MATX) is a company you can rely on to get the job done. Based in Hawaii, it’s been delivering the goods since 1882. In addition to a fleet of owned and chartered vessels, the company has provided logistics services for customers since 1987. Being among the top stock picks on this list, many may be concerned with this company’s recent performance. Indeed, MATX stock hasn’t fared well in 2022. It’s down more than 28% year-to-date. However, it’s up 119.2% over the past five years, more than double the S&amp;P 500.In the latest quarter, Matson grew revenue 4% to $1.11 billion, with EBITDA of $377.4 million, 9.7% less than Q3 2021. However, except for Alaska, its year-over-year volume of containers was lower during the quarter. The obvious reason for this slowdown can be traced back to China’s ongoing Covid-19 lockdowns and tight restrictions, which reduced its transpacific traffic significantly. During the quarter, Matson signed a $1 billion contract to acquire three LNG-ready Aloha Class containerships. The ships will add 500 containerships per voyage to its CLX (China-Long Beach Express) service. Notably, this move will help accelerate the company’s growth, when China gets back to operating at full capacity.I like Matson because this company has a sound balance sheet. Its long-term debt is $461.3 million, or just 19% of its market cap, while its free cash flow in the trailing 12 months is $1.3 billion [key ratios], more than half its current market cap.   Unless companies start flying their product from Asia, Matson is in good shape for years to come. Louisiana-Pacific (LPX)Piles of 2x4s in a warehouseSource: shutterstockYou might say that this pick is suicidal, given I’ve already selected one housing-related stock to the mix with Green Brick Partners. Instead, I want to add a second, given Louisiana-Pacific (NYSE:LPX) is one of the top stock picks I’ve been watching for some time. This company is a manufacturer of engineered wood products and other high-performance building solutions for new home construction and remodeling/renovation jobs worldwide. Like most housing-related stocks, LPX has gotten hit hard in 2022. It’s down more than 18% year-to-date, more than 200 basis points worse than the S&amp;P 500.While its overall sales were down in the third quarter by 16%, its Siding Solutions business had higher sales ($394 million to $388 million) than its legacy OSB business. The company’s siding business saw sales increase by 26% due to a 16% increase in price and 9% increase in volume. The company’s adjusted EBITDA jumped 24% in the quarter to $90 million. However, this profitability surge wasn’t enough to overcome the 70% decline for its OSB business. Overall, Louisiana-Pacific’s adjusted EBITDA was $200 million, down from $480 million a year earlier.While the company’s cash flow declined $180 million in the first nine months of 2022 to $1.1 billion, it still generates substantial free cash flow with very little long-term debt. This provides a relative buffer for those concerned about this current housing slowdown.By every valuation metric, LPX is cheaper than it has been in years. This company clearly deserves a spot on this list of top stock picks, in my view.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Humans have been conducting trade since the old ages, and with trade comes the risk of losing out in case of a bad deal. Some of the earliest examples of insulation against such deals come from the time of Hammurabi, the sixth king of the Old Babylonian Empire. Hammurabi's famous codex mandated that shippers only pay the principal of their loan to a creditor if their consignment was lost due to a natural disaster.Since then, the insurance industry has evolved and now uses complex mathematical and statistical models to determine what an individual must pay and what policies to offer. One insurance segment is life insurance, which protects families from financial difficulties in case a key member passes away. This industry is one of the largest in the world, according to research from Research Reports World. The firm estimates that the global life insurance sector was worth a whopping $2.8 trillion in 2021, and from then until 2027, it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.99% to sit an estimated $3.75 trillion.Today's piece will focus on the largest American life insurance providers, and some of the top firms in it are MetLife, Inc.

The stock market has cheered on his comments, providing nice relief for investors.Powell acknowledged the idea of smaller interest rate hikes potentially starting in December and reiterated that the Fed remains laser-focused on bringing inflation down.Further, Powell said that the Fed is likely to need somewhat higher rates in 2023 than the initial projections in September provided.While inflation obviously remains too high for the Fed’s liking, Powell’s relatively less-hawkish nature was a welcome sight by investors, boosting the major indices well into the green intraday.With the Fed fully committed to bringing inflation down, stocks in the financial sector, such as insurers, may see their profit margins expand in higher interest-rate environments.To back their policies, insurers primarily carry safe long-term bonds, allowing them to generate more money from their debt as interest rates rise.Three insurers – Aflac AFL, Unum Group UNM, and Reinsurance Group of America RGA – could all be considerations for investors during a higher interest-rate regime.Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs we can see, all three stocks reside well in the green year-to-date, becoming bright spots in an otherwise dim market. Let’s take a closer look at each one.AflacAflac is an American insurance company and a massive supplier of supplemental insurance within the U.S.For those that seek income, Aflac has that covered; the company’s annual dividend currently yields 2.2%, just a tick below its Zacks Finance sector average of 2.3%.Further, the company has shown a commitment to growing its dividend, upping its payout six times over the last five years, translating to a 10.8% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesCurrently, AFL shares trade at a 13.5X forward earnings multiple, above the 11.2X five-year median but below its Zacks sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAFL carries a Value Style Score of a B.Unum Group Unum Group provides disability insurance, long-term care insurance, life insurance, and employee-paid group benefits and related services.The company has witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions over the last several months, helping land the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSimilar to AFL, Unum Group pays its investors handsomely; the company’s annual dividend currently yields 3.2% paired with a 6.3% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.UNM pays out 23% of its earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchReinsurance Group of America Reinsurance Group of America is a leading global provider of traditional life and health reinsurance and financial solutions with operations in the United States, Canada, Europe, and others.RGA carries a loaded growth profile, with earnings forecasted to soar more than a quad-digit 1200% in its current fiscal year (FY22) and a further 3.4% in FY23.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue upticks of 3.8% in FY22 and 2.9% in FY23, indicating that margins are expanding quite notably.Further, shares are relatively cheap; the company’s shares currently trade at a 9.5X forward P/E ratio, well beneath the 12.1X five-year median and Zacks Finance sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRGA has found success within its quarterly results as of late, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by at least 76% in its last three quarters.Sales results paint a similarly positive story; RGA has exceeded sales expectations in eight consecutive quarters. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineA somewhat less-hawkish stance from the Fed gave stocks a significant boost in today’s session.Of course, it’s essential to know that the Fed is still fully committed to bringing inflation down, but the talk of potentially slower-paced rate hikes was a welcome sight by investors.During higher interest rate environments, companies such as – Aflac AFL, Unum Group UNM, and Reinsurance Group of America RGA – can see their profit margins expand.Additionally, the Zacks Finance sector is currently ranked #1 out of all 16 Zacks sectors, telling us that stocks within have been witnessing favorable earnings estimate revisions.After all, since a sector is nothing more than a group of stocks in a similar business, utilizing the Zacks Sector Rank is the perfect way to see which areas currently look more promising than others.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip the industry analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Biggest Copper Companies in the World.Copper is the third most used metal in the world with Chile as its biggest producer and China as its biggest importer. Copper price saw its peak in April at about $10,000 per tonne and has since lost a third of its price. The main culprits in declining copper prices are the fear of global recession along with China’s zero COVID policy, leading to weaker demand from the country. Additionally, the macroeconomic pressures forced a mass sell-off on London Metal Exchange.Copper Demand and SupplyThe annual copper demand is expected to increase by 53% by 2040, mainly due to the electrification of vehicles. Global EV sales are expected to account for 40% of the total car sales by 2030. However, the world is looking at copper shortages in the near future.The copper inventories are near historical lows. On top of that, copper giants are expected to face production shortages in the future. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) recently halted its $2 billion copper and gold project in Peru. Furthermore, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) management says that the latest copper prices are not enough to put forward new investments. According to S&amp;P Global’s worst-case projection, the copper shortfall could reach around 20% of consumption by 2035. In 2021, the copper deficit was only 2% of the consumption, and it lead copper prices to increase by 25%. According to Goldman Sachs, the copper prices on the benchmark London Metal Exchange are expected to reach $15,000 by 2025.Among the top copper-producing companies are BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP), Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), and Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE).Copyright: tomas1111 / 123RF Stock Photo Our MethodologyWe took a look at the copper industry and the biggest companies involved in producing the red metal.

This year, a total of $280,000 has been awarded to 40 organizations across 23 states, and Washington, D.C., helping to fuel and diversify sports opportunities for nearly 6,000 girls across 40 traditional and non-traditional sports.Sports 4 Life was launched in 2014 based on the knowledge that while sports participation offers tremendous life-long benefits – from improved physical health and self-esteem, to better grades in school and enhanced leadership skills – girls of color are disproportionately excluded. WSF's Title IX research report, ""50 Years of Title IX: We're Not Done Yet"" published earlier this year, clearly shows that girls and women of color participate in sport at lower levels, face greater barriers to participation, and are historically excluded in sport leadership. This program seeks to close this gap by strengthening and expanding opportunities for sports participation.""We are proud of the Sports 4 Life initiative and its enduring impact on BIPOC girls across this country as it helps give them the resources they need to reach their full potential in sport and life,"" said Danette Leighton, WSF CEO Danette Leighton. ""We are grateful for our partnership with espnW and Gatorade, and our shared work to positively impact the lives of girls in communities who lack sport access.""This year's Sports 4 Life recipients cover a gamut of traditional and non-traditional sports opportunities for girls, including boxing, fencing, lacrosse, mountain biking, pickleball, rugby, soccer and more. Thirty-three of the 40 grant recipient programs are new to Sports 4 Life funding - further expanding the reach of this powerful initiative.Story continuesSports 4 Life supports programs that help girls in four foundational areas – leadership, confidence, self-esteem, and perseverance – fostering girls' physical and emotional health and academic success. Last year, WSF rolled out a new discussion guide focused on developing girls' confidence, which supplemented the program's guide on leadership.""Sports 4 Life plays an integral role in ensuring that girls of color have equal access to the transformative benefits of sports,"" said Kevin Martinez, vice president of ESPN Corporate Citizenship. ""We are proud to have worked with the Women's Sports Foundation for more than eight years in a continued commitment to get more girls, who may not otherwise have access, playing.""According to WSF's Sports 4 Life seven-year impact report (2014-2020), only 17% of the girls reached by Sports 4 Life programming were previously participating in sports with regularity, and nearly all girls were interested in continuing sports after participating in Sports 4 Life funded programming.""Continuing to help break down barriers in sport so more girls have access to play is a shared mission between Gatorade and the Women's Sports Foundation. Through our Fuel Tomorrow initiative and long-standing espnW partnership, we're looking forward to making a positive impact in the community with Sports 4 Life,"" said Jen Schmit, Gatorade senior director of community marketing.The Sports 4 Life initiative strengthens and expands sport participation opportunities for girls of color through its grant making, leadership training and capacity-building efforts.

398,f1df3b96-eb0d-3e01-b5d6-59b58efdac82,PEP,2022-12-01,"With 72% ownership, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/72-ownership-pepsico-inc-nasdaq-140058294.html,1669816858,STORY,['PEP'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 72% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of PepsiCo. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PepsiCo?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that PepsiCo does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see PepsiCo's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in PepsiCo. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.2%. With 7.7% and 4.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of PepsiCoWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of PepsiCo, Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$390m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 27% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

(PEP) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-inc-pep-attracting-investor-140002038.html,1669816802,STORY,['PEP'],"[PepsiCo (PEP) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this food and beverage company have returned +1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which PepsiCo falls in, has gained 3.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share, indicating a change of +7.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.76 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.25 indicates a change of +7.2% from what PepsiCo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PepsiCo.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PEP _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For PepsiCo, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $26.74 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $85.13 billion and $87.79 billion estimates indicate +7.1% and +3.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPepsiCo reported revenues of $21.97 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.8%. EPS of $1.97 for the same period compares with $1.79 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.88 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.24%. The EPS surprise was +6.49%.Over the last four quarters, PepsiCo surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PepsiCo is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced new and updated data across its oncology pipeline will be presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology Immuno-Oncology (ESMO IO) Congress 2022 from December 7 to 9 in Geneva, Switzerland. Presentation highlights include first clinical results and new exploratory analyses from trials investigating LAG-3 inhibitor fianlimab and/or PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo® (cemiplimab) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma and cervical cancer.""Our ESMO IO presentations reflect our continued progress toward developing a differentiated oncology pipeline with the potential to treat a variety of cancers with unique combinations,"" said Israel Lowy, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational and Clinical Sciences, Oncology at Regeneron. ""Libtayo has already proven to be an effective immunotherapy across multiple tumor types and is poised to serve as a foundational therapy for our investigational combination approaches. Fianlimab combined with Libtayo has generated early-but-promising clinical activity in advanced melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, demonstrating the potential of Regeneron's oncology pipeline to potentially advance the standard-of-care in various cancers.""Among the research published by ESMO IO today were initial results for an investigational combination of fianlimab and Libtayo in patients with unresectable stage IIIB-C or IV NSCLC. The results are from two expansion cohorts of a Phase 1 trial – one with anti-PD-1/PD-L1-naïve patients (naïve cohort) and the other with anti-PD-1/PD-L1-experienced patients (experienced cohort). Patients received fianlimab 1600 milligrams and Libtayo 350 milligrams intravenously every 3 weeks for 12 months, with a median follow up of 9 months and 5 months for the naïve and experienced cohorts, respectively.Story continuesEfficacy results demonstrated an investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) of 27% (4 of 15 patients; all partial responses [PR]) in the naïve cohort and 7% in the experienced cohort (1 of 15 patients with a PR). Additionally, exploratory analyses of the naïve cohort found the ORR was 50% (3 patients) among those who had not received any prior systemic therapy and 100% (3 patients) among those with tumors that had ≥50% PD-L1 expression. Median duration of response was not reached in the naïve cohort and was 5 months in the experienced cohort (95% confidence interval: not evaluable to not evaluable).In terms of safety for the naïve and experienced cohorts, rates of ≥grade 3 adverse events (AE) were respectively 33% (5 patients) and 40% (6 patients), while rates of serious AEs were respectively 20% (3 patients) and 13% (2 patients). One patient in the naïve cohort and no patients in the experienced cohort discontinued treatment due to an AE; there were no treatment-related deaths reported in either cohort. Updated efficacy and safety data will be presented during a poster session (abstract #127P).Other notable presentations at ESMO IO include:An exploratory analysis of two expansion cohorts from a Phase 1 trial investigating fianlimab in combination with Libtayo in patients with advanced melanoma, which offer new insights on the use of this treatment combination in patients with poor prognostic features at baseline.A post-hoc exploratory analysis of Regeneron's Phase 3 EMPOWER trials in advanced NSCLC and advanced cervical cancer, focusing on efficacy outcomes in Libtayo-treated patients with liver metastases compared to those treated with chemotherapy alone.An oral presentation on EMPOWER-Lung 3 Part 1, a Phase 3 trial which assessed the efficacy and safety of Libtayo plus ipilimumab and platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, compared to Libtayo plus chemotherapy, and chemotherapy alone, in patients with advanced NSCLC and &lt;50% PD-L1 expression.Regeneron data at ESMO IOMedicineAbstract titleAbstractPresentation date/time(all CET)Lung cancerLibtayo, fianlimabPhase 1 study of fianlimab: A human lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) monoclonal antibody, in combination with cemiplimab in advanced NSCLC#127PDecember 812:30-13:15 pmLibtayoCemiplimab (cemi) + platinum doublet chemotherapy (chemo) + ipilimumab (ipi) for first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): EMPOWER-Lung 3 part 1#122MODecember 89:35-9:40 amLibtayoAn observational study to assess the effectiveness and safety of cemiplimab in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in routine clinical practice within Europe (CEMI-LUNG)#119TiPDecember 812:30-13:15 pmSkin cancerLibtayo, fianlimabPhase 1 study of fianlimab, a human lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) monoclonal antibody, in combination with cemiplimab in advanced melanoma (mel): subgroup analysis#150PDecember 812:30-13:15 pmOvarian cancerLibtayo, ubamatamabFirst-in-human (FIH) Phase 1/2 study of ubamatamab, a MUC16xCD3 bispecific antibody, administered alone or in combination with cemiplimab in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer (OC)#197TiPDecember 812:30-13:15 pmAdvanced solid tumors LibtayoLiver metastases (mets) and treatment effect of cemiplimab-based therapy: An analysis from three Phase 3 trials (EMPOWER-Lung 1, EMPOWER-Lung 3 part 2, and EMPOWER-Cervical 1)#168PDecember 812:30-13:15 pm The potential uses of Libtayo, fianlimab, ubamatamab and REGN6569 described above are investigational, and their safety and efficacy in these uses have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Union Pacific’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific What's The Opportunity In Union Pacific?According to my valuation model, Union Pacific seems to be fairly priced at around 9.90% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Union Pacific today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $193.60, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Union Pacific’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of Union Pacific look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Union Pacific's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? UNP’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock?

UNP, Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. CP, CSX Corp. CSX and Norfolk Southern Corp. NSC.Industry: RailroadLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2022908/4-railroad-stocks-to-capitalize-on-strong-freight-demandThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry is being aided by a steady improvement in freight demand, thanks to the buoyant U.S. economy, which is driving growth for the railroads. Despite this tailwind, the industry is being plagued by escalating fuel prices and supply-chain disruptions.Companies like Union Pacific Corp., Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd., CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. are expected to thrive on upbeat freight demand.About the IndustryThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry consists of railroad operators transporting freight (such as agricultural products, industrial products, coal, intermodal, automotive, consumer products, metals and minerals), primarily across North America. These companies focus on providing logistics and supply-chain expertise services.While freight constitutes a significant chunk of revenues, some of these companies also derive a small portion of their top line from other rail-related services, including third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, routine land sales and container sales, among others. A few companies offer service to multiple production and distribution facilities. Besides owning locomotives, some of these companies have equipment of leased locomotives, railcars etc.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Railroad IndustryHealthy Freight Demand: Freight demand continues to be strong in 2022 as pandemic fears fade, despite softening from the 2021 levels due to a shift in consumer spending from goods to services. The Cass Freight Index rose 2.9% on a year-over-year basis in October. With steady freight demand, railroads are benefiting from higher volumes and pricing gains. The upbeat freight environment is expected to continue in the near term.Story continuesDividend Hikes Signal Financial Strength: With the resumption of economic activities, many players, including some railroad companies are reactivating their shareholder-friendly measures like paying out dividends, which underline their solid financial footing and confidence in the business. Earlier in 2022, both UNP &amp; CSX upped its dividend 10% and 7.5% to $1.30 per share and 10 cents per share, respectively.Supply-Chain Disruptions a Woe: Persistent supply-chain disruptions, including labor and equipment shortages, are hurting railroad volumes in some segments, especially the carload and intermodal unit. Per The Association of American Railroads' latest rail traffic data, the total U.S. carload and intermodal units declined 0.5% year over year in October 2022. Supply-chain disruptions are likely to persist for a while now, thus denting carload and intermodal volumes.High Fuel Costs Hurt Bottom Line: Operating expenses are on the rise, mainly due to increased fuel costs. Fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player. High oil price (up 5.7% in the first nine months of 2022) is augmenting fuel costs. Even though oil price declined from its multi-year highs due to recession fears, it remains elevated.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Railroad industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #93. This rank places it in the top 37% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, implies encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry's position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimate has been revised 1.1% upward since June-end.Given the bullish near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few noteworthy stocks that you may want to hold in your portfolio. But it's worth looking at the industry's shareholder returns and its current valuation first.Industry's Price PerformanceOver the past year, the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry has declined 6.1% compared with the S&amp;P 500 composite's fall of 15.1% and the broader sector's decrease of 12%.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), a commonly used multiple for valuing railroad stocks, the industry is currently trading at 7.41X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 5.61X. It is also above the sector's P/B ratio of 4.27X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 10.86X, as low as 5.69X and at the median of 8.08X.4 Railroad Stocks to Keep Tabs OnEach of the stocks mentioned below currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Union Pacific: Based in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific provides rail transportation services across the United States.With economic activities gaining pace, freight revenues, accounting for the bulk of UNP's top line, are improving. In the first nine months of 2022, freight revenues improved 16% year over year. Segmentwise, freight revenues in the first nine months of 2022 increased 16%, 14% and 19% in the bulk, industrial and premium units, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNP's 2022 earnings is pegged at 15.8% growth from the 2021 reported number.Canadian Pacific: Headquartered in Calgary, Canada, Canadian Pacific operates a transcontinental railway network in Canada and the United States.With the gradual recovery in freight-market conditions, freight revenues, contributing considerably to the top line, increased 4% in 2021. In third-quarter 2022, freight revenues increased 19% despite headwinds like supply-chain woes remaining.The increase was owing to higher freight revenues at key sub-groups like intermodal where freight revenues surged 44%. Revenues at the Fertilizers and sulphur sub-segment were up 11% year over year.In the September quarter, total freight revenues per revenue ton-miles (RTMs) rose 11% year over year. Total freight revenues per carload rose 7% from the year-ago quarter's reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CP's 2022 revenues is pegged at 1.8% growth from the 2021 actuals.CSX: Based in Jacksonville, FL, CSX offers rail-based freight transportation services like traditional rail service, and transport of intermodal containers and trailers besides rail-to-truck transfers.CSX's top line is benefiting from higher export coal volumes, solid domestic intermodal shipments, volume growth in other segments and pricing gains. Evidently, coal revenues increased 36% in the first nine months of 2022, driven by strength in export coal. Intermodal revenues increased 19% in the first nine months of 2022, led by strong demand, mainly on the domestic front. Demand is likely to remain strong going forward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CSX's 2022 revenues stands at 22.4% growth from the year-ago reported figure.Norfolk Southern: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, Norfolk Southern is a major freight railroad company, primarily engaged in transporting raw material, intermediate products and finished goods.A strong demand scenario prompted management to increase its current-year revenue growth outlook. Total revenues are now expected to increase above 13% in 2022 from the 2021 levels (earlier outlook: growth in excess of 12%). The intermodal and merchandise segments are expected to be the main drivers.Near-term opportunities are present in the coal segment too. Driven by revenue growth, reported the operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is expected to be roughly 62% in 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NSC's 2022 earnings stands at 13.6% growth from the year-ago reading.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Our broad menu of over 400 neurology tests is powered by 15 distinct methodologies, providing transformative answers. Our 650+ medical experts provide consultation on next steps for physicians' patients, and we invest in state-of-the-art testing and technology, helping to drive accurate diagnoses for even the most complex cases.Neurological and psychiatric outcomes in survivors of COVID-191 in 3 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with a neurological or psychiatric disorder within 6 months of infection, per a retrospective cohort study using electronic health records (EHRs) of 236,379 COVID-19 survivors.1 Undiagnosed conditions due to deferred care are adding further to this crisis. Quest initiatives provide outreach and support for healthcare providers in uncovering undiagnosed conditions with targeted lab testing and education.Pharmacogenomics testingPharmacogenomics assesses how a patient's genes impact their potential response to specific medications and gives healthcare providers additional insights to optimize treatment considerations for better outcomes. We offer one of the most comprehensive test panels available today, the Quest Diagnostics Pharmacogenomics Panel, which provides information on more than 40 genes. Such testing is particularly helpful for patients taking several medications who may otherwise require multiple panels. Physicians receive test results in a comprehensive and easy-to-understand report, which can be used as a reference for patients throughout their lifetimes.Pioneering early Alzheimer's disease assessmentActively striving to end Alzheimer's disease (AD), Quest worked to create a new, accessible, and affordable blood-based biomarker test to assess AD risk. The assay allows healthcare providers to establish a baseline and monitor their patients over time using a simple blood sample. Late in 2021, published research confirmed that such assays are as effective as traditional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scans in identifying early signs of AD.2-4 Blood-based biomarker testing may also help identify patients who are candidates for early antibody treatment,5,6 which may help slow disease progression and improve quality of life.Story continuesRead More1.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Cloud Computing Stocks Heading into 2023.Cloud computing is a rapidly growing industry that is transforming the way businesses and consumers access and use digital services. By leveraging cloud computing, businesses can achieve greater scalability, flexibility, and efficiency compared to traditional IT solutions. Cloud-based services allow businesses to access applications and data from anywhere, at any time, and on any device.An Analysis of the Cloud Computing IndustryThe cloud computing industry is projected to grow at a rapid pace. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global cloud computing market was valued at roughly $369 billion in 2021. The market is expected to reach a valuation of $484 billion by the end of 2022. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15.7% from 2022 to 2030 and be worth $1.55 trillion by the end of the forecasted period. This growth is attributed to the integration of disruptive technologies such as AI and machine learning into cloud services and the shift to working remotely or in a hybrid manner. In addition, the increasing demand for cloud services, as well as the availability of a wide range of cloud solutions that can be tailored to meet specific business needs that are driving the growth of the global cloud computing market.Growth stocks have gotten hammered in 2022 due to high interest rates that have hurt their valuations.

SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is a global leader in enterprise software solutions and has been a major player in the software-as-a-service (SaaS) and cloud computing markets for years. The company has a strong presence in the enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) software markets and its solutions are used by businesses of all sizes around the world. The company has consistently reported strong financial results, with revenue and earnings growth in recent years driven by strong demand for its solutions and services. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) has also invested heavily in developing its cloud-based solutions and services. This has helped to drive growth and attract new customers. The company is also investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies, which it believes will be key to its future success.SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) holds a strong cash position and has free cash flows of EUR 3.87 billion. The company is well-positioned to grow its market share in the cloud computing industry and is among the best cloud computing stocks to buy now. On November 21, Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow upgraded SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) to Overweight from Equal Weight and reiterated his $136 price target on the stock.At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 17 hedge funds were long SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) and held stakes worth $1.16 billion in the company. This is compared to 16 positions in the preceding quarter with stakes worth $1.21 billion. As of September 30, Fisher Asset Management is the top investor in SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) and has a position worth $549.6 million in the company.Here is what Polen Capital had to say about SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is Europe’s largest software company and the global leader in enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. ERP is a software category that is particularly critical to business functions, and, therefore, has high retention rates even in times of economic stress. For the past several years, SAP has been going through several transitions, including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters, we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed, and the result should be a faster-growing, more consistent, higher margin, and more advantaged business. As investment costs from these transition programs wane, and as the benefits of higher growth continue, we expect that earnings will grow at a double-digit rate from next year (2023) onwards. In light of this, we believe the valuation is very attractive for longterm investors.”In addition to SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), big-tech companies such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are well-positioned to capitalize on the secular growth trends in the global cloud computing market.14.

The company, with its recent product launches, is trying to address the megatrends such as hybrid cloud, cloud security, 400-gig, 5G and WIFI 6, which is likely to drive the stock in the long run.Cisco has guided revenue growth for the first quarter of 2023 to be between 2-4% compared with the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $13.33 billion, suggesting growth of 3.33% from the year-ago period.However, overall negative sentiments about the cyclical tech industry due to rising inflation, probable recession due to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes and volatile Forex conditions have led to the fall in Cisco’s share price. The stock has tumbled 23.8% in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Computer - Networking industry’s decline of 23.6%.Further, as it ventures into new markets, Cisco is experiencing stiff competition from the likes of Wipro Limited WIT in cloud securities solutions.Wipro expanded its collaboration with VMware to help customers move data to the cloud at a reduced cost and operate in a multi-cloud infrastructure. With the recent collaboration, Wipro’s  FullStride cloud services will be able to provide its security services to customers for no additional cost and protect data while operating in a multi-cloud architecture. This is expected to help Wipro garner more customers amid rising competition.However, to deal with rising competition in cloud solutions and networking space, Cisco, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expanded its business partnership with General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), a business unit of General Dynamics GD.

The two companies have collaborated to deliver Cisco Private 5G services to various government enterprises for IoT and edge use cases.Cisco is expected to benefit in the coming quarters from the easing of supply chain constraints, which is likely to benefit the company in meeting its backlogs and aid top-line growth. As the company is also adding alternative suppliers, redesigning hundreds of products to use alternative components with similar capabilities and targeted price increases is likely to aid the company in fending off cost inflation and supply chain constraints.
