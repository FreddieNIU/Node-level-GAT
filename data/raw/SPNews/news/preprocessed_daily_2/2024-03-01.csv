If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating social security, you may go to 5 Social Security Spousal Benefits and Loopholes You Need to Know Now.', 'Starting this year, the 71 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will benefit from a 3.2% raise due to the COLA. COLA, an acronym for Cost of Living Adjustment, serves as an adjustment to Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments. This adjustment is meticulously crafted to counteract the repercussions of inflation, a phenomenon defined by the escalating prices within the economy. Considering the COLA for 2023 was a rewarding 8.7%, retirees aren’t quite pleased with this year’s adjustment.', ""This is because while it is true that the COLA is meant to help seniors cope with rising prices, many seniors are in turn saying that it's falling short of the hikes. According to the Senior Citizens League, the cost of items that older adults are spending most of their money on is consistently outpacing the COLA. The biggest culprit is that of healthcare."", 'With that being said, the average Social Security Check for 2024 after the 3.2% COLA is $1,907 in 2024. However, retirees should be advised that this bump is only an “adjustment”, and not a bonus.', '""If anything, these changes are a reminder that retirees\' incomes aren\'t truly fixed. Social Security benefits can change from year to year, and retirees can and should adjust their spending as their situation and the broader economic and financial environment evolve.""', '-Rob Williams, managing director for financial planning, retirement income, and wealth management at the The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) Center for Financial Research.', 'BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) seems to agree, stating that those who seem unhappy about the smaller COLA this year should be reminded that the Social Security Administration provides COLA to keep up with inflation. A notably reduced COLA signifies a substantial decline in inflation over the preceding year, as gauged by the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). However, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) states that it must also be noted that lower COLA for 2024 is still higher than the historical average.', ""Some retirees might think the upcoming raise is a bit late, considering years of high prices and gas costs. However, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) asserts that it's important to remember that this raise is here to stay. If the Federal Reserve's actions help lower inflation in the next months, retirees will still get to keep their increased benefits."", 'For those who have begun receiving social security, the COLA must have started reflecting on their checks since the beginning of the year. As such, the right time to file for these benefits depends on personal circumstances and family circumstances. Even more intricate is the navigation of these benefits, particularly when it comes to spousal ones. Social Security spousal benefits offer a range of opportunities for married individuals to optimize their retirement income. Beyond the straightforward benefits, there are some lesser-known benefits and loopholes, as we like to call them, that can be leveraged to maximize the financial advantages available to spouses. In this exploration, we delve into the realm of Social Security spousal benefits, shedding light on the conventional benefits and uncovering lesser-known aspects that couples can leverage to maximize spousal Social Security benefits. ', 'An elderly couple in a garden with a laptop, representing how the company empowers its customers to make the best retirement and tax-deferred investment decisions.', 'To compile the list of 14 social security spousal benefits and loopholes you need to know now, we began by exploring information from the Social Security Administration, as well as other sources such as Investopedia, Nasdaq, BankRate, and Forbes, to name a few. Next, we adopted a consensus approach to allot scores to each benefit and loophole we could find. Scores were summed and benefits were ranked in an ascending order from the lowest to the highest scores.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 2 ', ""As a prospective retiree, you may not be entitled to receive higher social security benefits due to possible gaps in your employment history, or even because you have a part-time job. Regardless of the reason, a spouse can claim social security benefits. According to the Social Security Administration, an individual can qualify for a spousal benefit if they are either 62 years of age or older, are any age and have in their care a child younger than age 16, or who has a disability and is entitled to receive benefits on your spouse's record. This spousal benefit could be one-half the amount their spouse is entitled to receive at their full retirement age. If the individual decides to wait until the full retirement age to receive these benefits, they will receive their full spouse's benefit amount, which is up to one-half the amount their spouse can receive. However, benefits do not grow beyond this."", '“Spousal benefits are capped at half your spouse’s benefit at full retirement age. If [the worker] waits beyond that to claim, the spousal benefit cannot grow further”.', '-Claire Toth, managing principal and senior wealth strategist at New Jersey-based Peapack-Gladstone Bank.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 3 ', ""For those individuals who are either stay-at-home parents or simply don't work for pay, Social Security still allows non-working spouses to receive benefits based on the earning records of their working spouse. These retirement benefits for a non-working spouse typically equal 50% of the working spouse’s benefits. The exact percentage, however, depends on when the nonworking spouse begins to receive benefits. These benefits are decreased if taken before reaching the full retirement age (FRA)."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 3 ', 'An ex-spouse may be eligible for spousal benefits based on the earning record of their former spouse even if that former spouse has remarried. This is a major social security spousal benefit and loophole you need to know now. To be eligible for the Social Security divorced spouse benefits, the spouse claiming the benefits must be at least 62 years old and not married, be divorced from a person who receives Social Security retirement or disability benefits, have been married to their ex-spouse for at least 10 years before the finalization of the divorce date, and have not been entitled an equal or higher retirement or disability benefits.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 4 ', ""In the case an individual is claiming spousal benefits when their spouse passes away, the Social Security spousal benefits are converted into survivor benefits. Survivors' benefits generally grant eligibility for up to 100% of the deceased spouse's benefit, incorporating any delayed retirement credits they earned before passing away. Widows or widowers can initiate the receipt of survivor benefits at age 60 (or at age 50 if dealing with a disability). However, similar to spousal benefits, claiming them before reaching full retirement age means they will receive reduced benefits."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 5 ', ""Generally, remarriage tends to terminate the right of an individual to receive Social Security benefits under their ex-spouse’s earning records. However, there are two exceptions to this rule that retirees should be aware of. The first exception, which can be deemed as the Social Security spousal benefits loophole, works where an individual who remarries at 60 or later may still be entitled to Social Security survivors' benefits if the second marriage ends before the death of the first spouse. This social security spousal benefit and loophole you need to know now will help you be aware of retaining benefits even in the case of remarriage."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 6 ', 'Another exception to the Social Security termination after remarriage is that ex-spouses with a disability who remarry at age 50 or older will also be able to retain their Social Security survivor’s benefits. The provision understands that disabled individuals have unique circumstances and offers continued access to them.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 7 ', 'If you are a worker filing for retirement benefits, your spouse may be eligible for a benefit based on your earnings. However, they must be at least 62 years of age, or older, to claim these benefits. There is one social security advantage, however, that nullifies this age requirement. This is that the spouse has a qualifying child in his/her care. A qualifying child is a child who is under the age of 16 or who receives Social Security disability benefits.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 8 ', ""The next pointer on our list of social security spousal benefits and loopholes you need to know about is that an individual can switch from their survivor benefits. According to the SSA, the earliest that a widow or widower can start receiving reduced benefits is as early as the age of 60. If the benefits start at an earlier age, they are reduced by a fraction of a percent for each month before full retirement age. The hack that you need to know, however, is that if the person receiving widow/widower benefits will be qualifying for a retirement benefit that's more than their survivor benefits, they can even switch to their retirement benefit. Switching can be made as early as age 62 or as late as age 70, notes the SSA. Since the rules are complicated and vary depending on the situation at hand, it's probably best to discuss it with a Social Security Representative."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 9 ', 'As discussed, survivors are allowed to switch to their retirement benefits if they are larger. As such, they are advised to optimize their Social Security benefits by deferring the collection of the larger benefit to the last possible moment. This approach ensures that the higher benefit, which forms the foundation for future cost-of-living adjustments, will be sustained throughout their lifetime.', 'Click to continue reading and see the 5 Social Security Spousal Benefits and Loopholes You Need to Know Now.

Contrarily, they do exist even in your golden period, underscoring the importance of proactive planning to navigate their impact effectively. According to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), there are two “unknowns” looming in retirement: the taxable portion of your income, and their tax rate. Even though these unknowns exist, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) asserts that it is still possible to plan for a “potentially better tax outcome”.', '""One approach is to use accounts with a variety of tax treatments so you can better control your taxable income in retirement”.', '-Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning, retirement income, and wealth management at the The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) Center for Financial Research.', 'The four main account types—tax-deferred, Roth, taxable, and health savings accounts (HSAs)—offer unique tax advantages. Employing strategies such as capturing employer matches, utilizing HSAs for medical expenses, maximizing tax-advantaged savings, investing tax-efficiently, and considering Roth conversions can offer a diversified and flexible approach to managing taxes in retirement.', '""Anticipating future tax rates is always a bit of a guessing game, but with several account types at your disposal, there\'s potential to build in flexibility and a surprising level of control over future tax bills.""', '- Rob Williams', ""Employing this approach can indeed provide a measure of control over your retirement taxes. Yet, a significant number of retirees are also leveraging an alternative strategy: moving states. That’s right, a large number of homebuyers have been actively moving states in the past many years, many of whom are retirees. For the fourth consecutive year, California leads U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL)'s Growth Index as the state with the highest number of outbound moves, according to a study conducted by U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL). California is notorious for its high cost of living, and it is no surprise that homebuyers are looking to move out and into states that offer nicer weather, and lower cost of living. The U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) Report claims that their growth index “is an effective gauge of how well states and cities are attracting and maintaining residents”, even though it does not directly correlate to economic or population increases."", 'So where are potential retirees moving anyway? Apparently, Texas, Florida, and the Carolinas are the most popular states that individuals are moving to. Texas and Florida are not only revered for their warm climate, but also because of their attractive cost of living. Moreover, both of these states don’t tax social security. Since retirees have fixed incomes to depend on, they are increasingly favoring states that have a lower tax burden, a lower-than-average cost of living, and a warm climate to ensure they can lead a comfortable life.', 'This article delves into the tax landscape for retirees, specifically focusing on states that offer the advantage of not taxing retirement pension payouts.

Well, one fund that you should consider investigating is Schwab Core Equity (SWANX). SWANX possesses a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.', 'Objective', 'We note that SWANX is a Large Cap Blend option, an area loaded with different options. More often than not, Large Cap Blend mutual funds invest in companies with a market cap of over $10 billion. Buying stakes in bigger companies offer these funds more stability, and are well-suited for investors with a "" buy and hold "" mindset. Additionally, blended funds mix large, more established firms into their portfolios, giving investors exposure to value and growth opportunities.', 'History of Fund/Manager', ""SWANX finds itself in the Schwab Funds family, based out of San Francisco, CA. Schwab Core Equity made its debut in June of 1996, and since then, SWANX has accumulated about $1.20 billion in assets, per the most up-to-date date available. A team of investment professionals is the fund's current manager."", 'Performance', 'Obviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 11.86%, and it sits in the bottom third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 9.77%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.', ""It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower."", ""When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of SWANX over the past three years is 16.28% compared to the category average of 17.33%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 17.82% compared to the category average of 18.42%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade."", 'Risk Factors', ""Investors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 0.96, which means it is hypothetically less volatile than the market at large. Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration, since it represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which in this case, is the S&P 500. The fund has produced a negative alpha over the past 5 years of -1.72, which shows that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns."", 'Holdings', 'Examining the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise. This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology, as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach. For this particular fund, the focus is mostly on equities that are traded in the United States.', ""Right now, 89.24% of this mutual fund's holdings are stocks, with an average market capitalization of $435.78 billion. The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors:"", 'Technology', 'Retail Trade', 'Finance', 'Turnover is about 14%, so those in charge of the fund make fewer trades than comparable funds.', 'Expenses', 'Costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, SWANX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.73% compared to the category average of 0.76%. So, SWANX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective.', 'While the minimum initial investment for the product is $0, investors should also note that there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.', 'Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.', 'Bottom Line', 'Overall, Schwab Core Equity ( SWANX ) has a neutral Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively weak performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a somewhat average choice for investors right now.', ""Your research on the Large Cap Blend segment doesn't have to stop here.

On FTE basis, NIM was 2.46%, down 37 basis points.Non-interest income was $140.3 million, up 11.8% year over year. The rise was primarily driven by an increase in trust and securities processing, service charges on deposit accounts and investment securities gain.Non-interest expenses were $290 million, up 21.9% year over year. The rise was caused by higher regulatory fees, mainly from FDIC special assessment. Also, a rise in processing fees and an uptick in deferred compensation expenses were some of the other major reasons behind the jump. These were partially offset by a decline in bonus and commission expenses, equipment costs, and legal and consulting expenses. The operating non-interest expense was $235.9 million.The efficiency ratio increased to 77.65% from the prior-year quarter’s 63.72%. An increase in efficiency ratio indicates a decrease in profitability.As of Dec 31, 2023, average loans and leases were $23.1 billion, up 1.6% sequentially. Also, average deposits increased 4.3% to $32.7 billion.', 'The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.02% in the reported quarter, which decreased from 0.04% in the year-ago quarter.Also, total non-accrual and restructured loans were $13.2 million, down 31.4% year over year.The provision for credit losses was nil for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $9 million reported in the prior-year quarter.

While dividend payments have never been the first priority of the Oracle of Omaha while looking for new investments, he does give them a lot of importance and almost always mentions his portfolio companies with growing dividends in his annual letters. In his latest annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett talked about Coca-Cola\xa0Co (NYSE:KO) and American Express\xa0Company (NYSE:AXP), in which Berkshire owns $24 billion and $28 billion worth of stakes, respectively.', '""During 2023, we did not buy or sell a share of either AMEX or Coke – extending our own Rip Van Winkle slumber that has now lasted well over two decades. Both companies again rewarded our inaction last year by increasing their earnings and dividends. Indeed, our share of AMEX earnings in 2023 considerably exceeded the $1.3 billion cost of our long-ago purchase. Both AMEX and Coke will almost certainly increase their dividends in 2024 – about 16% in the case of AMEX – and we will most certainly leave our holdings untouched throughout the year. Could I create a better worldwide business than these two enjoy? As Bertie will tell you: “No way.”', 'Though Berkshire did not purchase shares of either company in 2023, your indirect ownership of both Coke and AMEX increased a bit last year because of share repurchases we made at Berkshire. Such repurchases work to increase your participation in every asset that Berkshire owns. To this obvious but often overlooked truth, I add my usual caveat: All stock repurchases should be price-dependent. What is sensible at a discount to business-value becomes stupid if done at a premium.', 'The lesson from Coke and AMEX? When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable.""', 'Buffett loves it when he does not have to touch his stakes and let the investments do all the work. He believes his investments are rewarded when the companies he has invested in increase dividends and focus on shareholder returns.', 'Methodology', ""But Coca Cola and American Express aren’t the only two dividend-paying stocks in Buffett's portfolio. In this article we scanned Berkshire's Q4 portfolio and picked 15 stocks that pay dividends. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here)."", ""Warren Buffett's Stake:\xa0$840,449,860"", ""T-Mobile Us Inc(NAQSDAQ:TMUS) ranks 15th in our list of the best dividend stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett.

In January T-Mobile Us Inc (NAQSDAQ:TMUS) posted fourth quarter results, according which T-Mobile Us Inc's (NAQSDAQ:TMUS) GAAP EPS in the quarter came in at $1.67, missing estimates by $0.23.

T-Mobile is the best-in-class player in the wireless space, delivering the strongest growth with the lowest cost structure and the best consumer proposition. T-Mobile’s strength is rooted in its advantaged competitive position. Its superior spectrum holdings enable it to provide better wireless service at meaningfully lower cost. T-Mobile’s annual capital expenditures run about $10 billion, on the order of half the amount its peers must spend. Due to its lower cost structure, T-Mobile can undercut its competitors on price while still generating compelling profitability and returns.', 'This combination — superior service at lower prices — has enabled T-Mobile to outgrow its competition. In the three years since completing its merger with Sprint, T-Mobile has grown its post-paid subscriber base by about 22%. Over the same period, AT&T’s has grown by about 14%, while Verizon’s by less than 5%.', 'Given the high fixed-cost nature of the wireless business, these steady increases in revenue growth have led to outsize increases in profits and free cash flow. Free cash flow in 2023 is expected to come in around $13.5 billion, up from less than $8 billion last year. In 2024 free cash flow is expected to grow by over 20% to approximately $17 billion — providing a 10% yield based on today’s stock price.', 'We have long admired T-Mobile, but until recently the stock did not pay a dividend. The company announced its inaugural dividend in September, and we bought the stock shortly thereafter. The initial yield is about 2% and it is expected to grow about 10% per year.”', ""Warren Buffett's Stake:\xa0$1,193,182,000"", ""Professional services and management consulting company Aon Plc (NYSE:AON) is one of the low-yield dividend stocks in Warren Buffett's portfolio.

The Redmond, Washington-based firm’s shares have soared 68% in the last year, making it the most valuable company in the world, as it seeks to become a leader in AI adoption.', 'Musk is suing for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and claims of unfair business practices, among other grievances. He is bringing the suit in the capacity of a donor to the nonprofit parent organization as recently as 2019 and is seeking to force OpenAI to stop benefitting Microsoft and Altman personally.', 'In the lawsuit, he asks for an order to compel OpenAI to make all of its research and technology open to the public and for Altman to be required to give up any money he has earned as a result of the practices alleged to be unlawful. Musk is also seeking unspecified damages, which the lawsuit says he would contribute to charity if any compensation is won.', 'Musk invested tens of millions of dollars in OpenAI, as well as his time and other resources, “on the condition that OpenAI would remain a nonprofit irrevocably dedicated to creating safe, open-source AGI for public benefit,” only to then have OpenAI abandon its mission, according to the suit.', 'Musk’s claim that OpenAI’s close relationship with Microsoft goes against the company’s original commitment to public, open-source AI, will be “an extraordinarily hard claim legally to make,” according to securities attorney and Northwestern University adjunct law professor Andrew Stoltmann. These are often called illusory promises and they generally aren’t enforceable under the law, Stoltmann said, noting that Musk has a history of using lawsuits as a way to send a message.', 'Since introducing ChatGPT and GPT-4, the large language model that powers the chatbot, OpenAI has set off a wave of AI adoption in businesses around the world. Microsoft has been one of the most aggressive in incorporating the technology into its wide array of cloud and enterprise services. Musk contends that OpenAI’s GPT-4 can be viewed as an AGI system. Altman expects AGI to be reached in the next four to five years, according to a December Time Magazine profile of him.', 'The world’s richest person, Musk helped establish OpenAI in 2015 but stepped away from the company some two years later over philosophical differences about the development of the technology.', 'The lawsuit argues that Musk first grew alarmed about powerful AI falling into corporate control when Google moved to buy DeepMind, the British research lab. Musk recruited Luke Nosek, who earlier had co-founded PayPal with Musk, in a bid to buy DeepMind in late 2013. They ultimately failed and Google acquired DeepMind a year later.', 'Read More: xAI Potential Investors Focus on ‘Muskonomy,’ OpenAI Success', 'In the filing, Musk took aim at the restructuring of OpenAI’s leadership last year, a tumultuous period during which Altman was ousted as CEO and then quickly reinstated with support from Microsoft. Musk argued in the suit that Altman, OpenAI President Greg Brockman and Microsoft worked together to oust the majority of the startup’s board, who had been responsible for enforcing its original mission of developing technology for the benefit of humanity.', '“Altman hand-picked a new board that lacks similar technical expertise or any substantial background in AI governance, which the previous board had by design,” the lawsuit said. “The new board consisted of members with more experience in profit-centric enterprises or politics than in AI ethics and governance. They were also reportedly ‘big fans of Altman.’”', 'The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether the company misled its investors during that process last year, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on the probe. Other regulatory agencies, including the European Union and multiple US authorities, are also probing the relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft. The concerns broadly speak to whether OpenAI has been transparent enough about its for-profit dealings and whether its for-profit partnerships are too powerful.', 'The suit also asks for more scrutiny on Altman’s actions personally, and “the board’s ability to control Mr. Altman’s use of OpenAI to advance his own economic interests, which so far appear to have gone unchecked.” The suit cites Altman’s signing of a letter of intent in 2019, “to buy $51 million worth of chips from a start-up in which Mr. Altman was heavily invested.”', '“Mr. Musk is a party to OpenAI’s founding agreement and that gives him the right to sue if he believes Mr. Altman and others are straying from the promises they made in that agreement,” said Larry Hamermesh, a retired University of Pennsylvania law professor who is an expert in Delaware corporate law.', 'Musk has been building a trail of legal challenges. Last November he sued the nonprofit group Media Matters for America, accusing it of “maliciously” driving away advertisers from X, and in July sued another nonprofit, The Center for Countering Digital Hate. A judge on Thursday looked set to dismiss that case.', 'In December, X lost its effort to block a California law that seeks to control toxic posts on social media by requiring companies to disclose their content-moderation polices.', 'Musk has also threatened to sue over artificial intelligence before. Last April he posted on Twitter, now X, that he might take legal action against Microsoft for what he said was its use of the social media platform’s data to train its AI technology. “They trained illegally using Twitter data. Lawsuit time,” he wrote. And he threatened to go after Meta Platforms Inc.’s Threads, after it launched a social media service that rivals X.', 'SpaceX, another company Musk heads, sued the US military over government contracts awarded to Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. Musk later dropped the suit. SpaceX is now suing to get the National Labor Relations Board declared unconstitutional after the US labor agency accused the company of retaliating against eight employees who circulated an open letter critical of Musk.', '--With assistance from Agatha Cantrill, Mark Bergen, Bob Van Voris, Jef Feeley and Chris Dolmetsch.', '(Updates with comment from lawyer.

The gains were driven by its better-than-expected results in recent quarters and the acceleration in the company's business thanks to artificial intelligence (AI)."", ""But what if you're one of those investors who don't have Microsoft stock in their portfolios yet? Are all the gains already priced in for this tech stock giant?"", ""Microsoft's revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2024 (which ended on Dec. 31) increased 15% year over year to $118.5 billion. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings over that time jumped 30% to $5.92 per share."", ""The company's performance so far in the current fiscal year indicates that it is on track to grow at a much faster pace than fiscal 2023, when its annual revenue increased 7% to $212 billion and non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings increased by a similar magnitude to $9.81 per share. Microsoft anticipates its fiscal Q3 revenue will land between $60 billion and $61 billion. That points toward a 14% year-over-year increase at the midpoint, suggesting that the company's stronger pace of growth is here to stay."", ""Analysts expect the company to finish the fiscal year at the end of June with a 15% jump in annual revenue to $244 billion. Microsoft's earnings, meanwhile, are expected to increase 19% to $11.66 per share. It is not that difficult to see why the company is now clocking faster growth."", ""The adoption of AI is having a positive impact on key Microsoft products. The company's Azure cloud business, for instance, is gaining market share thanks to a variety of AI training and inference tools that Microsoft is providing on the platform. On its January earnings conference call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella remarked that the Azure AI platform now has more than 53,000 customers. More than a third of those customers are new ones, having joined the Microsoft Azure AI ecosystem over the past year."", ""More specifically, Microsoft's cloud business received a boost of six percentage points thanks to AI services. It is also worth noting that its Azure cloud services revenue increased 30% year over year, outpacing Amazon Web Services' 20% growth and Alphabet's Google Cloud's 26% year-over-year jump in the previous quarter."", ""The global cloud computing market is expected to generate $2.4 trillion in revenue by 2030, as compared to $569 billion in 2022. So Microsoft's improving share of this market bodes well for the company from a long-term perspective. However, this is not the only area where AI could drive solid growth for Microsoft. It is integrating generative AI tools into its productivity apps as well."", ""Users and businesses can purchase subscriptions for using Microsoft's Copilot generative AI app to create images, summarize documents, and use AI in popular applications such as Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint. With the demand for cloud-based office productivity software predicted to increase at an annual rate of 25% through 2030, generating an annual revenue of $128 billion at the end of the forecast period, Microsoft is making the right move by integrating AI into its productivity tools."", 'Microsoft is the second-largest player in the office productivity market, with a share of 30%. The company points out that customers using the AI Copilot in Microsoft 365 ""were 29% faster in the series of tasks, like searching, writing, and summarizing."" As a result, the likelihood of Microsoft being able to sell more Copilot subscriptions should not be ruled out, and this could help it capitalize on the multibillion-dollar end-market opportunity in this space.', ""Thanks to these catalysts, it is not surprising to see why Microsoft's earnings per share (EPS) estimates have been heading higher in recent months."", ""As the chart indicates, Microsoft's earnings could increase to $15.65 per share in fiscal 2026. The stock is currently trading at 35 times forward earnings, which is not that expensive when compared to the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple of 31 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). Given that AI is accelerating Microsoft's growth, the company could continue commanding a premium earnings multiple in the future as well."", 'Assuming Microsoft trades at 35 times earnings after three years and generates $15.65 per share in earnings at that time, its stock price could jump to $552. That points toward a 35% gain from current levels. However, if Microsoft can clock higher earnings growth and the market rewards it with a higher valuation because of its AI prospects, this ""Magnificent Seven"" stock could deliver more upside.', ""That's why investors who haven't bought Microsoft stock yet could still consider doing so, as it seems built for more upside."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Undoubtedly, mega-cap beverage companies are some of the best recession-resilient stocks to sip on if you fear some sort of downturn. And while their economic moats (high barriers to entry) remain relatively wide, some smaller players on the scene, such as MNST, STZ, and COCO, have unique tricks up their sleeves to win over the consumer.', 'Therefore, let’s use TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to weigh in on three beverage stocks that are favored by analysts.', 'It may be hard to believe, but Monster Energy stock has been one of the best market performers in recent decades, topping the likes of some pretty notable Magnificent Seven companies. Over the last 10 years, shares have risen 356%. And though the pace of gains has slowed somewhat, with shares rising just shy of 16% in the past year, I’d argue the stock still makes sense to own for its robust brand and still-lengthy growth runway.', 'With a modest $61.5 billion market cap and caffeinated innovation flowing through its veins, I see a pathway to higher highs. As such, I’m staying bullish on the stock as it looks to break out past its multi-quarter ceiling of resistance at $60 per share. Last year, Monster grew its drink revenue by 13%. It’s not explosive growth, but it’s decent for a drink company, nonetheless, especially when you factor in inflation.', 'The most enticing part of Monster’s growth is that it may be more sustainable than mega-cap tech firms sporting similar growth rates. The company demonstrated its pricing power, hiking prices amid inflation to keep up with higher costs.', 'Thus far, consumers don’t seem to be making a big deal of higher prices, as they would for some absurdly overpriced snack foods. People need their energy and want the drinks to taste good, which is a challenging feat, considering how some alternative options seem to taste downright unpleasant!', 'With a Zero-Sugar line (as well as other new products), the recent acquisition of Bang Energy, and plenty of international growth runway, I believe Monster has what it takes to continue delivering monster performance for investors. Just don’t expect it to keep crushing the Magnificent Seven from here.', 'Monster stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 13 Buys and five Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average MNST stock price target\xa0of $64.10 implies 8.5% upside potential.', 'From caffeinated beverages to alcoholic ones, we have Constellation Brands, a firm that’s really gone flat in recent years. The stock is just 4% higher than its peak in early 2021. And though the firm is technically a “sin stock,” I’d argue that it’s one of the better value options to play the beverage scene right now, given its rock-solid brand portfolio and strength following its latest quarterly earnings.', 'Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) went as far as to name STZ as its top beverage stock pick. Clearly, the latest numbers gave them plenty of confidence. For now, I’m sticking with the analyst community and am staying bullish.', 'Five-star-rated Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohesenian views Constellation’s growth profile as not yet being priced in quite yet. After a solid round of earnings and the means to triumph over its beer rivals, I’d say the odds are on his side. Constellation certainly stock looks primed for performance.', 'At just 18.1 times next year’s expected price-to-earnings (P/E), STZ looks like a relative bargain. Its Beer Business, in particular, is expected to see net sales growth of 7-9%.', 'Given that the firm owns some pretty premium brands in its portfolio, I’m perplexed as to why shares trade at such a notable discount to the alcoholic beverages industry average of 20.9 times forward P/E. Perhaps Mr. Mohesenian is correct in that the market may be discounting the firm’s growth prospects from here.', 'Constellation stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 13 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average STZ stock price target\xa0of $295.50 implies 18.9% upside potential.', 'Shifting gears from beer to coconut water, we have Vita Coco, a mid-cap stock ($1.48 billion market cap) I think you have to own if you’re a big fan of its products and the rise of healthy, plant-based beverages that don’t skimp on the tastiness factor. As an all-natural product, coconut water stands out as one of the best positioned to ride the secular trend of increased health consciousness regarding food and drink.', 'However, there’s only one issue: coconut water is predominantly a commoditized product that can’t really be differentiated by any sort of secret recipe. In any case, I view Vita Coco’s well-run supply chain as an advantage that could help it rally even more. That said, I’d keep tabs on industry competitors, especially those that are serious about cracking into the market. For now, I’m staying bullish as the firm continues navigating through a tougher environment for consumers.', 'Coconut water is way pricier than water, and that may make Vita Coco more sensitive to fluctuations in the economy. With inflation and macro headwinds weighing on all consumers, though, I find it remarkable that Vita Coco’s numbers haven’t been too negatively impacted.', 'I attribute the company’s resilience to its colossal growth runway, exceptional operational stewardship, and success with expanding into flavored forms of coconut water, something that could help Vita Coco differentiate itself from the competition, perhaps giving the firm the means to stand out in the otherwise commoditized coconut water market.', 'At 41.4 times trailing P/E (around 28 times forward), shares are priced with growth in mind. The real question is whether COCO can continue to find success as it expands into new geographies. If it can, the current price of admission seems fair or even a tad on the cheap side.', 'Vita Coco stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with six Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average COCO stock price target\xa0of $29.20 implies 11.9% upside potential.', 'Apart from the rise in health consciousness (saying no to sugar), it seems like younger generations are a bit more open to trying something new, especially if you’ve got influencer marketing involved. Think Logan Paul and his Prime drinks, which have clearly hit a tune among young consumers. This alone may cause some to question if modern times pose a threat to some of the most old-fashioned moats out there.', 'While I don’t think Warren Buffett needs to worry about Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) anytime soon, I do believe that investors seeking a bit of sizzle should look beyond the classic beverage kingpin for greater growth. It also doesn’t help that Coke shares have been flat lately, down 3% over the past two years.', 'Of the fast-growing trio, analysts expect the most upside from STZ, with about 19% in gains expected for the year ahead.', 'Disclosure']"

With a strong working capital of $4.43 billion, up from $3.76 billion the previous year, and net cash provided by operating activities at approximately $1.72 billion, Monster Beverage Corp's financial foundation appears solid as it navigates the competitive beverage landscape."", ""Brand Portfolio and Market Presence: Monster Beverage Corp's strength lies in its diverse and well-recognized brand portfolio, which includes Monster Energy, Reign, NOS, and its recent foray into the alcohol segment with craft beers and hard seltzers. The company's strategic partnership with TCCC, which holds a 19.5% stake, enhances its distribution capabilities and market reach. This alliance has been instrumental in driving growth, with TCCC-affiliated entities accounting for a significant portion of net sales. The Monster Energy Drinks segment, in particular, has shown impressive performance, contributing $6.56 billion to net sales, a 12.4% increase from the previous year."", 'Innovative Marketing and Distribution: Monster Beverage Corp\'s marketing prowess is a key strength, with a 15.8% increase in sales and marketing program expenditures. The company\'s ""push-pull"" marketing strategy, which includes sponsorships, endorsements, and in-store promotions, effectively drives consumer demand. Its distribution strategy, leveraging both direct sales and partnerships with bottlers/distributors, ensures widespread availability of its products across various retail channels, including e-commerce platforms.', ""Financial Performance: The company's financial health is robust, with a significant increase in working capital and a doubling of net cash provided by operating activities. This financial stability provides Monster Beverage Corp with the resources to invest in brand development, international expansion, and innovation, which are crucial for sustaining growth in the competitive beverage industry."", 'Gross Profit Margin Pressures: Despite its strong sales, Monster Beverage Corp faces challenges in maintaining high gross profit margins, particularly in its Alcohol Brands segment, which has lower margins compared to the Monster Energy Drinks segment. This indicates a potential need to optimize costs and improve efficiency in the production and distribution of its alcohol products to enhance profitability.', ""Reliance on Strategic Partners: The company's reliance on TCCC and other key bottlers/distributors for a significant portion of its net sales could be a vulnerability. Changes in these relationships or a decision by a major partner to reduce purchases could materially affect Monster Beverage Corp's financial condition and operations."", ""Supply Chain Risks: Monster Beverage Corp's supply chain is subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials, which could impact production costs and product availability. While the company has entered into purchase agreements to secure supplies, external factors such as crop yields and geopolitical events could still pose risks."", ""International Expansion: Monster Beverage Corp has identified international growth as a key opportunity, with net sales outside the U.S. showing significant increases. The company's ability to replicate its successful marketing and distribution strategies in new markets could lead to further revenue growth and market share gains."", ""Product Innovation: The company's historical success has been driven by its ability to innovate and introduce unique beverages that resonate with consumers. Continued investment in research and development could yield new products that cater to evolving consumer preferences and health trends, potentially opening up new market segments."", ""Alcohol Segment Diversification: The acquisition of Bang Energy and the development of the Alcohol Brands segment present opportunities to diversify Monster Beverage Corp's product offerings and revenue sources. By capitalizing on the growing popularity of craft beers and hard seltzers, the company can tap into new consumer demographics and occasions."", ""Regulatory Changes: The beverage industry, particularly the energy and alcohol drink markets, faces potential regulatory changes that could restrict sales, require additional labeling, or impose taxes. Such changes could adversely affect Monster Beverage Corp's sales and necessitate adjustments to its product formulations and marketing strategies."", ""Economic Volatility: Global economic uncertainty can impact consumer discretionary spending, which in turn affects the demand for Monster Beverage Corp's products. The company must navigate these economic fluctuations while maintaining its brand value and market position."", ""Health and Wellness Trends: Increasing consumer and regulatory focus on health issues related to obesity, inactive lifestyles, and alcohol consumption poses a threat to Monster Beverage Corp's product lines. The company's commitment to offering a broad range of diet, light, and low-calorie beverages is essential to address these concerns and maintain consumer trust."", 'In conclusion, Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ:MNST) exhibits a strong market presence and', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

That firm notes that this year may seem some moderation. So what are the strongest plays for investors in this space? Let's bring in Gary Taylor, TD Cowen senior equity research analyst to discuss more. Good to talk to you today. Let's start by talking about this growth story. How much more runway do you think there is?"", ""GARY TAYLOR: Hey, good morning. Thanks for having me. It's a good question. I think we are going to see hospital revenue growth moderate. And it's so important to us to track not just for the market cap and the sector that's the actual hospital or provider stocks, but you have exponentially more market cap, which is the health insurance companies. And these costs, this hospital revenue growth, this provider revenue growth is the medical expenses that the payers have to pay for. So it's really important to both those sectors."", ""Overall, I think there's one more really good month. I think February will be good. It's going to be driven by leap year. And then as we get into the rest of the year starting in March, the comps get so much more difficult that we expect we are going to see this revenue growth moderating for providers, and therefore the medical expenses moderating for the health insurance companies."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: You've pointed out in your note that you think this trade is in the late cycle right now. With that said, walk me through some of your top picks on the back of this growth."", ""GARY TAYLOR: Sure. Depends on time frame. Obviously it depends on risk appetite. But in the very near term, we came into the year saying we want to own the providers over the health insurers for the first half of the year and anticipating that by the time we pivoted to the back half, we'd be in a position to want to recommend payers over providers."", ""So we're currently still in the first half of the year, obviously. We're still in that provider trade. Our favorite names are HCA, largest hospital company in the US; Acadia, which is one of the largest freestanding behavioral providers; and then also Surgery Partners, which is an ambulatory surgery center company."", ""The only insurer that we've kind of bumped up into that top category this early in the year is Humana. And that's because Humana's had terrible news. They've cut their earnings guidance in half, the stock's gone down 40%, and we're opportunistically wanting to take advantage of that stock being lower."", ""AKIKO FUJITA: So for those who are watching this not necessarily following the trade so far, what's a good entry point when you think about some of those names that you just highlighted?"", ""GARY TAYLOR: Yeah. Well, for the provider trade, I think it's a little late. So if you're a retail investor and you're looking at HCA, for example, HCA November was 225 going into its Investor Day. People thought the outlook was terrible. The stock's now at 310. This isn't a great entry point, in my view."", ""If you have a multi-year view, long-term investor, best company in the health care provider space, absolutely own the stock. Don't care much about entry point. But honestly, we'd like probably like to see that back at the 280, 290 range to be more opportunistic outside of just owning it for the next month or two."", ""On Humana, we think below $400 is pretty interesting. The stock's at $350. There's one more piece of negative news that could come out in April. The bear case is it would kind of take the stock to the 320 range. But the reality is we think Humana in 18 months is worth somewhere between 450 and 500. So if your dollar cost averaging entry point anywhere here in the next month or two at 350 or lower, we think that's pretty attractive."", 'AKIKO FUJITA: UnitedHealth, one of those names that you mentioned as one of the top picks. We got the announcement yesterday that the DOJ has launched an antitrust investigation into the company. How should investors be looking at that headline right now? And how big of a risk is it?', ""GARY TAYLOR: Yeah. Well, United's not one of our top picks right now. We are recommending the stock, but it's not one of our top picks. Honestly, what we're concerned right now really is more of the near-term fundamentals of the company. We think it's likely they missed the first quarter medical loss ratio. We do think there's at least mid-single digit earnings risk for United for 2024."", ""We don't think they've guided particularly conservatively. We'd be looking again to add to that a little bit lower heading into the back half of the year. But with respect to DOJ, I'm less concerned about it. Honestly, we see some political motivation here. We know there's some ties to the Senate staffers, senators, you know, that don't like health insurance in general, that particularly think United is problematic and some ties to the DOJ."", ""So honestly, it looks a little bit politically motivated. And just from a fundamental perspective, we don't believe there's a lot of markets where United would be violating traditional antitrust horizontal standards. So to make any real case is going to rely upon some of the more novel vertical theories of harm that the FTC and the DOJ have promulgated. And honestly, they've been pretty unsuccessful with those in the courts of late."", 'AKIKO FUJITA: Gary Taylor, TD Cowen senior equity research analyst, good to talk to you. Today.

While radio may not come to mind when you think about monster growth potential, there is a reason why Sirius XM has earned a position in Warren Buffett's esteemed portfolio."", ""Let's dig into Sirius XM's business and get an understanding of how the radio giant makes its money. More importantly, after assessing the business model, investors should take a hard look at the company's financial and operating profiles to determine whether following Buffett's lead makes sense."", 'Most radio stations survive on revenue from advertisers. As with commercials on television, brands study analytics around which stations in different markets are the most popular. By getting a better understanding of this demographic data, advertisers can then target specific campaigns to groups of listeners throughout the day.', ""Sirius XM is a little different from traditional terrestrial radio stations, though. The company essentially owns the satellite-radio industry in North America. Given its dominant reach, you'd be correct in assuming that advertisers are eager to get in front of Sirius's base. However, would you be surprised to learn that only about 20% of the company's revenue comes from advertising?"", ""Over three-quarters of Sirius XM's revenue actually comes from subscriptions. That's right! Unlike terrestrial radio stations, listeners do not have the ability to simply tune in to Sirius. Rather, the company requires that you buy a subscription in order to access its exclusive content library, which is filled with music, talk shows, sports stations, and more."", ""Buffett's investment style is actually quite simple. The billionaire investor typically seeks companies that generate steady growth and sustained profits, and that build best-in-breed brands.

Subscriber growth has been inconsistent over the last several years, and is currently in decline. The company has also struggled to recapture pre-pandemic levels."", ""In a way, this makes some sense. Despite Sirius XM's leading position in satellite radio, one detriment to its business is that there are alternative forms of streaming competition.

Essentially the first fragmentation of media, cable brought people with common interests together, says Eric Deggans, NPR television critic.', '“People who were previously marginalized by the focus on mass culture suddenly got a voice and a connection with other people like them,” Deggans says. “So young music fans worldwide bonded over MTV, Black people and folks who love Black culture bonded over BET, middle-aged women bonded over Lifetime and fans of home remodeling convened around HGTV and old-school TLC.”', ""Nickelodeon and Disney became de facto baby sitters.

Only a year earlier, 42% said streaming was their default choice.', 'Much of what people stream are programs originally on broadcast and cable.

The move not only boosts user engagement but also allows industry participants to raise the prices of their services at an appropriate time without the fear of losing subscribers.', 'Uncertain Macro-Economic Scenario Hurts Production and Ad Demand: Advertising is a significant revenue source for the Broadcast Radio and Television industry.

This has been a significant impediment to industry participants’ growth.', 'Low-Priced Skinny Bundles Affect Revenues: Increased cord-cutting has forced industry participants to offer “skinny bundles.” These services, available through the Internet, often contain fewer channels than a traditional subscription and, therefore, are cheaper. The move is in line with changing consumer viewing dynamics, as growth in Internet penetration and advancements in mobile, video and wireless technologies have boosted small-screen viewing.

Dividend growth stocks, which are companies that regularly increase their cash payouts to shareholders annually, have significantly outperformed the majority of other asset classes over this 124-year span.', 'The primary reason for this is the power of compounding. By owning a dividend growth stock and reinvesting the dividends each quarter, your investment can experience exponential growth without any additional effort from you.', ""The healthcare sector is a hub for numerous leading dividend growth stocks. Many of these companies provide essential goods and services that are less affected by economic cycles. In addition, most healthcare firms have substantial profit margins, leading to healthy levels of free cash flow every quarter. While most of these companies don't offer extremely high yields, they typically increase the size of their dividend payouts annually."", ""So, which dividend growth stocks in the healthcare sector stand out? Biotechnology giants AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) and Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) have both generously rewarded their long-term shareholders with a rapid dividend growth rate, a substantial yield, and consistent capital appreciation. Let's examine which of these top dividend growth stocks is the better investment at the moment."", 'AbbVie is a dominant force in the field of immunology. Since its separation from Abbott Laboratories over a decade ago, the company has been a leading vehicle for capital appreciation, largely due to the robust commercial performance of its anti-inflammatory drug, Humira.', ""Despite Humira's commercial momentum slowing down due to the emergence of biosimilars, AbbVie expects newer immunology drugs like Skyrizi and Rinvoq to eventually offset losses from this key patent expiry. Additionally, AbbVie boasts a growing pipeline and product portfolio in the areas of cancer, neuroscience, and medical aesthetics."", ""In terms of dividend growth, AbbVie has increased its annual cash distributions to shareholders by an average of 7.69% over the past five years. Currently, the pharmaceutical company's shares offer an annualized yield of 3.46%, more than twice the average yield of equities listed on the S&P 500."", ""However, it's worth noting that AbbVie's debt-to-equity ratio, a measure of the company's financial leverage, currently stands at 582%. Its trailing 12-month payout ratio of 217% also raises concerns, particularly given the sharp drop in its top-line growth."", ""Amgen is a trailblazer in the biotech industry. The company boasts an innovative array of drugs and drug candidates that cover areas from cardiology care to immunology and cancer. While Amgen is currently undergoing a portfolio transition due to its wide range of aging former star products, newer medications like the cholesterol-lowering drug Repatha have stepped in to fill the gap in recent quarters. The company's recent acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, a specialist in rare diseases, is expected to further enhance its growth trajectory in the coming years."", 'In terms of dividends, Amgen offers a robust annualized yield of 3.23% and a scorching five-year dividend growth rate of 9.1%. It also maintains a comfortable trailing 12-month payout ratio of around 68%, indicating that its dividend is well supported by earnings.', 'However, Amgen does face a leverage issue, as evidenced by its substantial 1,049% debt-to-equity ratio. The silver lining is that analysts predict the biotech will achieve top-line growth exceeding 20% over the next two years. Consequently, Amgen should possess the financial strength needed to rapidly reduce leverage, although it may not be in a position to readily undertake additional bolt-on acquisitions in the near future.', ""In this comparison, Amgen appears to be the more attractive dividend growth stock. While both stocks could potentially be valuable long-term investments, Amgen's dividend scans as safer due to its relatively average payout ratio for a biopharmaceutical company. The company has also been increasing the size of its dividend checks at a faster rate over the past five years."", 'Although AbbVie is likely to continue increasing its dividend in the coming years for reasons not covered in this article, Amgen comes across as the safer of the two based on the all-important payout ratio metric.

The recent spot bitcoin ETF approvals provide exposure to bitcoin with custody taken care of as part of the package. However, many investors already hold or are interested in owning the assets directly and understanding where to store and secure those assets is new and often a technical challenge.', 'Miguel Kudry from L1 Advisors provides an overview of crypto custody solutions for advisors.', 'Todd Bendell from Amphibian Capital answers common questions about custody in this asset class in the Ask an Expert section.', 'Happy reading.', '– S.M.', 'You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.', 'The landscape of crypto custody is ever-evolving, where the control and access of digital assets is determined by the custody setup chosen by the investor, or the custody method of the investment vehicle. As a financial advisor, it is crucial to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to crypto custody. Instead, the most suitable solution depends on your client’s specific needs, goals and risk appetite.', 'In the world of crypto, whoever holds the private keys to a digital asset controls it. This control can be maintained by the investor themselves (self-custody or non-custodial solutions) or by a third party (custodial solutions) on behalf of the investor. Custody methods also determine the level of discretion advisors have over these assets.', 'Custodial solutions have come a long way. Over the years, advisors and their clients have gained more access to more compliant options to gain exposure. Some of the earliest solutions included publicly-traded vehicles with less than efficient pricing mechanisms, as well as private funds and hedge funds, some of which stored their assets on unregulated exchanges and custodians. Over time, qualified custodians have become the norm for these vehicles.', 'In 2020, the market saw the introduction of Separately Managed Account (SMA) solutions. SMAs provide a compliant way for advisors to gain direct exposure and discretion over their digital asset portfolios. Cryptocurrencies managed on SMA platforms are held in custody by qualified custodians which often act as liquidity providers for trades and other transactions of those platforms.', 'Fast forward to 2024, and on Jan. 10, the approval of 11 spot bitcoin ETF applications by the SEC opened the door to a new and efficient indirect ownership option. Although ETFs are not the purest form of ""holding"" digital assets, they are certainly seeing demand and addressing a need of a segment of the market, as seen in the average $300 million in daily new inflows for the first five days of trading and over $1 billion in net new inflows. This makes the spot bitcoin ETFs one of the most popular ETF launches in history.', 'Advisors can pick and choose', 'Boomer Saraga, founder and CEO of Khelp Financial, employs a diversified strategy in managing crypto custody. His approach includes integrating ETFs into various investment vehicles like 401Ks, brokerage accounts and holdings for large corporations and institutions. Saraga articulates his strategy, noting, “For high net worth individuals that are foreign to crypto and digital solutions but want differentiated exposure, Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) offer an ideal solution.” He further adds that “digital natives,” adept in blockchain and DApps, are more likely to find self-custody solutions a better fit for their investment style.', 'The top chart is an oversimplified view of the crypto custody landscape, let alone the various investment vehicles or wrappers available to advisors and investors. This chart does not indicate performance, effectiveness or efficiency of the actual exposure or investment vehicles. It is a simple way to showcase two important inherent features of digital assets: access and control. Let’s define them.', 'Level of access: it refers to how closely an investor can interact with or from a digital asset in its purest form (on-chain). The more off-chain layers or wrappers around an asset, the less level of access. For example, the spot bitcoin ETF is a traditional (offchain) financial product backed 1:1 by bitcoins stored in a qualified custodian. Being cash-redeemable only, investors can’t redeem their shares for actual bitcoin, but they must liquidate them for cash. On the other end of the spectrum, self-custody is the purest, most direct access to the on-chain asset, with instant settlement and with the ability to do things with that asset directly – be it transferring, swapping, staking, lending, or borrowing against it – without the need for proxies or additional settlement layers.', 'Level of control: it is a measure of how much power an investor has to make decisions about their assets without external limitations or the need for permissions from third parties. For example, the newly approved spot bitcoin ETF does not give investors the ability to control the underlying bitcoins in custody that their shares represent (or the need to worry about private key management, for that matter), nor does it allow them to redeem, or withdraw bitcoin. On the other end of the spectrum, self-custodied assets can be used, moved, or traded at any time by whoever holds the private key, with the increased responsibility that entails.', 'Implications of custody and discretion (or the lack thereof)', 'The wealth and asset management industries have largely been built around asset discretion. This is why digital asset advisory solutions have focused on developing custodial, discretionary products that mirror the traditional advisory and investment management landscape. This has led to a growing segment of self-custodied, self-directed clients who’ve delved into digital assets on their own, seeking a wider range of tokenized products, yield, and other on-chain products, ultimately growing a portfolio outside of the advisory relationship.', 'The growth in the total addressable market of self-custodied clients will lead to the emergence of non-discretionary asset advisory as a relevant category. This trend, popular among younger, self-directed investors, reflects the findings of Fidelity’s new study, showing that younger investors want their financial advisor to be their financial and personal coach. This shift in client expectations represents an opportunity for advisors who recommend and coach their clients rather than dictate and control their investment and financial decisions.', 'Other considerations and what this means for your practice', 'Tax considerations play a significant role in the selection of a custody solution. For example, the cash-redemption nature of the spot bitcoin ETF will trigger a taxable event on every sale of shares. In contrast, an investor who owns the underlying digital asset can move their assets anywhere without triggering a taxable event.', 'Advisors may choose a combination of vehicles and custody solutions to provide exposure to digital assets, considering different investment horizons, tax strategy, risk appetite and liquidity requirements. A mix of digital assets in tax-advantaged accounts or retirement accounts in the form of an ETF, alongside direct ownership through a custodial or self-custodied solution, can accommodate different financial goals and needs.', 'From a fees perspective, Ironclad Financial founder Nick Rygiel sees increased competition starting a race across the industry to lower fees, “either through negotiation or acquiring their own custody solution, much like Fidelity has their own,” said Rygiel, whose firm caters to technology-savvy clients.', 'As a financial advisor, understanding the nuances of crypto custody will be essential to provide the best possible service to existing clients, and to hone in on your target market’s needs and expectations.', '- Miguel Kudry, CEO, L1 Advisors', 'Q. How does one maintain custody off-exchange and trade on exchange?', 'A: There are numerous solutions to be able to trade on exchanges without keeping all your collateral or tokens on exchange. An example of the first to market was Copper Clearloop with MPC technology and delegating assets to exchange to trade. Fireblocks and other providers are following suit. More recently, there have been tri-party agreements between banks (a regulated financial institution) and exchanges, notably between Binance and a Swiss bank. The assets are held off exchange in escrow with the bank and ""virtual margin"" is created to allow hedge funds and individuals to trade on exchange without keeping collateral on exchange.', 'Q. Is buying a BTC spot ETF safer than self-custody of your own BTC (or other tokens)?', 'A. I would not argue one is safer than the other, but they are different models of getting exposure. With crypto natives, almost all would prefer to hold the keys and have the tokens in their possession and control at all times. When holding your own tokens you can leverage them, lend against and generally have more freedom. A risk with this is managing/losing keys or passwords which could lead to loss of assets. The BTC spot ETF approval has opened up the gates for a whole new class of investor. The U.S. retail market, RIA money managers, 401Ks and pension funds can all now easily get exposure to BTC via an instrument they are familiar with. There is no additional technical prowess required and is the simplest way to get exposure to the asset class. This is likely good for volumes over the long term.', '— Todd Bendell, Co-Founder Amphibian Capital', 'The recently approved spot bitcoin ETFs reached $10B trading volume on day 3.', 'Last week saw crypto outflows as the bankruptcy trustees in charge of FTX liquidated $1B of assets held in GBTC.', 'Morningstar asks advisors to consider if they are ready to handle the fees and price volatility of crypto if the spot bitcoin ETFs get included in client portfolios.']"

The recent spot bitcoin ETF approvals provide exposure to bitcoin with custody taken care of as part of the package. However, many investors already hold or are interested in owning the assets directly and understanding where to store and secure those assets is new and often a technical challenge.', 'Miguel Kudry from L1 Advisors provides an overview of crypto custody solutions for advisors.', 'Todd Bendell from Amphibian Capital answers common questions about custody in this asset class in the Ask an Expert section.', 'Happy reading.', '– S.M.', 'You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.', 'The landscape of crypto custody is ever-evolving, where the control and access of digital assets is determined by the custody setup chosen by the investor, or the custody method of the investment vehicle. As a financial advisor, it is crucial to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to crypto custody. Instead, the most suitable solution depends on your client’s specific needs, goals and risk appetite.', 'In the world of crypto, whoever holds the private keys to a digital asset controls it. This control can be maintained by the investor themselves (self-custody or non-custodial solutions) or by a third party (custodial solutions) on behalf of the investor. Custody methods also determine the level of discretion advisors have over these assets.', 'Custodial solutions have come a long way. Over the years, advisors and their clients have gained more access to more compliant options to gain exposure. Some of the earliest solutions included publicly-traded vehicles with less than efficient pricing mechanisms, as well as private funds and hedge funds, some of which stored their assets on unregulated exchanges and custodians. Over time, qualified custodians have become the norm for these vehicles.', 'In 2020, the market saw the introduction of Separately Managed Account (SMA) solutions. SMAs provide a compliant way for advisors to gain direct exposure and discretion over their digital asset portfolios. Cryptocurrencies managed on SMA platforms are held in custody by qualified custodians which often act as liquidity providers for trades and other transactions of those platforms.', 'Fast forward to 2024, and on Jan. 10, the approval of 11 spot bitcoin ETF applications by the SEC opened the door to a new and efficient indirect ownership option. Although ETFs are not the purest form of ""holding"" digital assets, they are certainly seeing demand and addressing a need of a segment of the market, as seen in the average $300 million in daily new inflows for the first five days of trading and over $1 billion in net new inflows. This makes the spot bitcoin ETFs one of the most popular ETF launches in history.', 'Advisors can pick and choose', 'Boomer Saraga, founder and CEO of Khelp Financial, employs a diversified strategy in managing crypto custody. His approach includes integrating ETFs into various investment vehicles like 401Ks, brokerage accounts and holdings for large corporations and institutions. Saraga articulates his strategy, noting, “For high net worth individuals that are foreign to crypto and digital solutions but want differentiated exposure, Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) offer an ideal solution.” He further adds that “digital natives,” adept in blockchain and DApps, are more likely to find self-custody solutions a better fit for their investment style.', 'The top chart is an oversimplified view of the crypto custody landscape, let alone the various investment vehicles or wrappers available to advisors and investors. This chart does not indicate performance, effectiveness or efficiency of the actual exposure or investment vehicles. It is a simple way to showcase two important inherent features of digital assets: access and control. Let’s define them.', 'Level of access: it refers to how closely an investor can interact with or from a digital asset in its purest form (on-chain). The more off-chain layers or wrappers around an asset, the less level of access. For example, the spot bitcoin ETF is a traditional (offchain) financial product backed 1:1 by bitcoins stored in a qualified custodian. Being cash-redeemable only, investors can’t redeem their shares for actual bitcoin, but they must liquidate them for cash. On the other end of the spectrum, self-custody is the purest, most direct access to the on-chain asset, with instant settlement and with the ability to do things with that asset directly – be it transferring, swapping, staking, lending, or borrowing against it – without the need for proxies or additional settlement layers.', 'Level of control: it is a measure of how much power an investor has to make decisions about their assets without external limitations or the need for permissions from third parties. For example, the newly approved spot bitcoin ETF does not give investors the ability to control the underlying bitcoins in custody that their shares represent (or the need to worry about private key management, for that matter), nor does it allow them to redeem, or withdraw bitcoin. On the other end of the spectrum, self-custodied assets can be used, moved, or traded at any time by whoever holds the private key, with the increased responsibility that entails.', 'Implications of custody and discretion (or the lack thereof)', 'The wealth and asset management industries have largely been built around asset discretion. This is why digital asset advisory solutions have focused on developing custodial, discretionary products that mirror the traditional advisory and investment management landscape. This has led to a growing segment of self-custodied, self-directed clients who’ve delved into digital assets on their own, seeking a wider range of tokenized products, yield, and other on-chain products, ultimately growing a portfolio outside of the advisory relationship.', 'The growth in the total addressable market of self-custodied clients will lead to the emergence of non-discretionary asset advisory as a relevant category. This trend, popular among younger, self-directed investors, reflects the findings of Fidelity’s new study, showing that younger investors want their financial advisor to be their financial and personal coach. This shift in client expectations represents an opportunity for advisors who recommend and coach their clients rather than dictate and control their investment and financial decisions.', 'Other considerations and what this means for your practice', 'Tax considerations play a significant role in the selection of a custody solution. For example, the cash-redemption nature of the spot bitcoin ETF will trigger a taxable event on every sale of shares. In contrast, an investor who owns the underlying digital asset can move their assets anywhere without triggering a taxable event.', 'Advisors may choose a combination of vehicles and custody solutions to provide exposure to digital assets, considering different investment horizons, tax strategy, risk appetite and liquidity requirements. A mix of digital assets in tax-advantaged accounts or retirement accounts in the form of an ETF, alongside direct ownership through a custodial or self-custodied solution, can accommodate different financial goals and needs.', 'From a fees perspective, Ironclad Financial founder Nick Rygiel sees increased competition starting a race across the industry to lower fees, “either through negotiation or acquiring their own custody solution, much like Fidelity has their own,” said Rygiel, whose firm caters to technology-savvy clients.', 'As a financial advisor, understanding the nuances of crypto custody will be essential to provide the best possible service to existing clients, and to hone in on your target market’s needs and expectations.', '- Miguel Kudry, CEO, L1 Advisors', 'Q. How does one maintain custody off-exchange and trade on exchange?', 'A: There are numerous solutions to be able to trade on exchanges without keeping all your collateral or tokens on exchange. An example of the first to market was Copper Clearloop with MPC technology and delegating assets to exchange to trade. Fireblocks and other providers are following suit. More recently, there have been tri-party agreements between banks (a regulated financial institution) and exchanges, notably between Binance and a Swiss bank. The assets are held off exchange in escrow with the bank and ""virtual margin"" is created to allow hedge funds and individuals to trade on exchange without keeping collateral on exchange.', 'Q. Is buying a BTC spot ETF safer than self-custody of your own BTC (or other tokens)?', 'A. I would not argue one is safer than the other, but they are different models of getting exposure. With crypto natives, almost all would prefer to hold the keys and have the tokens in their possession and control at all times. When holding your own tokens you can leverage them, lend against and generally have more freedom. A risk with this is managing/losing keys or passwords which could lead to loss of assets. The BTC spot ETF approval has opened up the gates for a whole new class of investor. The U.S. retail market, RIA money managers, 401Ks and pension funds can all now easily get exposure to BTC via an instrument they are familiar with. There is no additional technical prowess required and is the simplest way to get exposure to the asset class. This is likely good for volumes over the long term.', '— Todd Bendell, Co-Founder Amphibian Capital', 'The recently approved spot bitcoin ETFs reached $10B trading volume on day 3.', 'Last week saw crypto outflows as the bankruptcy trustees in charge of FTX liquidated $1B of assets held in GBTC.', 'Morningstar asks advisors to consider if they are ready to handle the fees and price volatility of crypto if the spot bitcoin ETFs get included in client portfolios.']"

Booking sites like Expedia (EXPE) have issued cautious commentary, explaining the ""post-COVID acceleration"" is slowing down.', 'In the latest edition of Travel Guide 2024: Industry Insights, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi breaks down bullish, company-specific attributes for hotel stock investors to keep in mind.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", ""BRAD SMITH: Do you even RevPAR? How can we play the hospitality trade? Joining us now as part of Yahoo Finance's Travel Guide 2024, Industry Insights, we've got our very own executive editor Brian Sozzi."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: All right, when it comes to making money in the biggest hotel names in 2023, it was a relatively easy endeavor. Ride most all of the stocks because revenue per available room was rocking as hotel operators pushed through higher prices with traveling roaring back. However, in recent weeks, we have gotten new wrinkles to investing in hotel stocks mostly due to cautious commentary from booking sites, Expedia and Booking Holdings. Take a listen to what Expedia CEO, who is outgoing, told us about current demand trends.', ""PETER KERN: The markets are slowing a bit, the travel market. It's still growing, but the post-COVID thing is slowing down a bit. So the acceleration is lower. Really Asia and Latin America have been driving this past year more than anything and that's all slowing down. You know, it's really just a decel of the whole globe back to sort of more normal post-COVID levels."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: All right, so what does this all mean to investors in the hotel space? It means investors have to move beyond the outsized focus on revenue per available room and look for bullish company-specific attributes. And we, of course, have your guide for that one. I think the other way of looking at this is you actually have to do some work this year, guys, to find a good hotel stock. Luckily for you, I'm going to tee this up and it's all free."", 'So three bullish indicators. First up, hotels that are buying back a ton of stock and paying dividends. Usually, I think in this environment where things are slowing down, these are the shareholder-friendly actions you would like to see.', 'I look at Hilton. I look at Marriott. Hilton last year, $2 and a half billion given back in terms of capital to shareholders, eyeing $3 billion this year.', ""Marriott, real whopping number here, guys. $4 billion in capital returned to shareholders last year. That's dividend and stock buybacks. Looking at about $4.1 to $4.3 billion this year. So lots of good things there from both of those companies."", 'Bullish indicator number two, hotels that are aggressively building pipelines. Not pipelines to underground stations, it is pipelines to opening more rooms. Hilton added more than 130,000 rooms to its pipeline in 2023, looking to add even more rooms this year.', ""You have Marriott added 164,000 rooms to its development pipeline in 2023. Right now that company's pipeline stands at a record 573,000 rooms. That's just a massive number, guys."", ""And the last bullish indicator number three, hotel leadership teams staying hungry for more. I love execs that are just going for it all. They're not hungry with prior success."", ""That's just my thing and I love seeing this. And I see it really in three names, Marriott like I've mentioned here. I look at that company's executive team pushing into Las Vegas finally with a new MGM loyalty deal that will probably boost the loyalty program for Marriott, which is already industry leading."", ""Choice Hotels, I love that this company has gone hostile for Wyndham and Wyndham is saying, no, no, we don't want you. Well, they may not have a choice because that deal might actually get done. And then lastly Hilton, they recently signed an interesting deal with small luxury hotels of the world to push deeper into the luxury market, a new arena for them, luxurious vacation. So again, some three indicators here you want to be looking for if you want to pick some hotel stocks.""]"

If you want to skip our introduction to the global space industry and all the latest news, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Valuable Space Companies in the World. ', ""Just as high technology industries such as genetic engineering and artificial intelligence have rapidly grown at levels that would have been thought unimaginable at the turn of this century, space exploration is another sector that has rapidly captured the public imagination. While space has always been a popular endeavor, after the Space Shuttle's retirement, the U.S. space industry slowed down at least as far as launch vehicle development is concerned. After the Shuttle, while rockets such as the United Launch Alliance's (ULA) Atlas lineup continued to launch top secret national security payloads, the heart of space exploration — crewed missions to low Earth orbit (LEO) and beyond — took place only from Russia."", ""However, ever since SpaceX successfully flew the Crew Dragon to the International Space Station (ISS) with NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, the Kennedy Space Center in Florida has been bustling with activity. At the same time, other crewed spacecraft commissioned by the space agency have also been developing their spacecraft. While SpaceX's Crew Dragon remains the only U.S. spacecraft certified by NASA for orbital spaceflight, the other spacecraft currently being developed for NASA contracts is The Boeing Company's (NYSE:BA) Starliner. Additionally, Sierra Space is developing its Dream Chaser space plane, initially for NASA cargo contracts."", ""This intermix of private space companies vying for NASA awards is also the 21st century version of the space agency. For the U.S. space industry, NASA's operating model prior to Shuttle's retirement saw the agency engage itself with its private space company contractors during every step of a vehicle's design. Once the design was finished and the end product went through multiple tests certifying it for flight, NASA took ownership of the vehicle and operated it on its now."", ""Now, the most valuable space companies in the world are those that are capable of operating their own rockets and serving the needs of a myriad of government and private sector contractors in addition to the world's leading space agency. In fact, the extent to which this principle has taken hold over the space industry is evident by the fact that you really didn't have to read this piece to know which company is the most valuable space company in the world. SpaceX is a household name by now, and it's the biggest space company in the world as far as market capitalization is concerned."", ""While we'll get to SpaceX's market capitalization later, the firm's dominance in the launch vehicle industry is clear by the fact that February 2024 marked a unique achievement for the company and the global space industry. This is because in mid February, before SpaceX launched a mission for the U.S. Space Force, the firm became the only one in human history to have had four rockets vertical at four launch pads. While SpaceX's rocket launch for the space force was ready for lift off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, it was ready to launch NASA payloads on an Intuitive Machines, Inc. (NASDAQ:LUNR) lunar lander, had placed the Falcon 9 vertical for a Starlink launch from California and stacked the Starship second stage spacecraft on the Super Heavy booster in Boca Chica, Texas."", ""This latest tryst came when the space company stock NASDAQ:LUNR soared by double digit percentages on the stock market. Why did Intuitive Machines's shares soar? Well, its Nova C Odysseus lunar lander marked America's second attempt to land a lander on the Moon since the Apollo era. The first attempt had come earlier this year, when Pittsburgh based Astrobotic's Peregrine lunar lander kicked off the NASA Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, but Intuitive Machines's lunar lander seemed to have caught investors' eyes since it promises to make a lunar landing attempt in just a week after its launch."", ""The Intuitive Machines Odysseus lunar lander will use a methane powered rocket engine for its journey to the Moon, and the firm successfully managed early post launch complications by feeding new commands to the lander's guidance and navigation systems from Earth."", ""The Odysseus launch coupled with the SpaceX Starship and NASA Artemis programs marks a new era for space companies stocks. It also means that companies like SpaceX have started to become like NASA in their operations. Prior to the Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon, NASA's crewed launches were managed by the agency's controllers. Now, SpaceX is responsible for the astronauts' journey to the station, and this is not through accident. When it comes to private space companies vs NASA, the space agency also finds it easier to scale up human spaceflight programs by offshoring some of the risks involved in sending humans at speeds of thousands of kilometers per hour in the Earth's atmosphere and into space. While NASA's Space Shuttle program completed 133 successful flights over three decades, its two notable accidents that led to the demise of all crew on board are still the biggest criticism that its detractors have."", ""Finally, before we take the wraps off of the most valuable and biggest space companies in the world, it's important to note that while firms such as SpaceX and Boeing are among the most widely discussed space stocks, the sector as a whole is quite diversified. Broadly speaking, space stocks can be divided into two categories. The first is of firms that make space vehicles like SpaceX's Falcon 9, Boeing's Starliner and SLS for NASA, and Intuitive Machines' Odysseus. The second belongs to satellite companies such as Planet Labs PBC (NYSE:PL) and Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT) whose bread and butter is based on operating imaging, telecommunications, and other satellites. Of course, before anyone points out, SpaceX is also a satellite company since its Starlink satellite internet constellation is now made of nearly six thousand small telecommunications satellites."", ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at the most valuable space companies in the world. In this list, some notable space stocks that are publicly available for trading are The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (OTC:MHVYF), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)."", ""A close-up of an antenna, its intricate designs a testament to the company's expertise in space infrastructure."", 'Our Methodology', 'To make our list of the most valuable space companies in the world, we first ranked all publicly traded companies that are either pureplay rocket or satellite companies or have sizeable space business divisions that are relied on by government agencies.

Total revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.37 billion.The revenue decline, as expected, was due to a steep drop in revenues from its COVID-19 products, Comirnaty and Paxlovid, on lower demand.With the end of the pandemic, sales of Pfizer’s COVID-19 products declined steeply. Sales of Prevnar family and Ibrance also declined in the quarter.

U.S. revenues declined 46% to $4.59 billion.Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses rose 1% (operationally) in the quarter to $4.47 billion primarily due to the timing of marketing and promotional activities.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase Mosaic's shares before the 6th of March in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 21st of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.21 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.84 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Mosaic stock has a trailing yield of around 2.7% on the current share price of US$31.16. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Mosaic ', 'Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Mosaic paid out just 23% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It distributed 35% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.', ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That's why it's comforting to see Mosaic's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 24% per annum for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Mosaic's dividend payments per share have declined at 1.7% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring."", ""Is Mosaic an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Mosaic has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. Unfortunately it's cut the dividend at least once in the past 10 years, but the conservative payout ratio makes the current dividend look sustainable. Mosaic looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely."", ""With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces.

', ""If there's one thing that can be said with certainty as well as settle into 2024, it's that the electric vehicle industry is a changed sector. Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine took place in 2022, the clean energy sector that's led by electric vehicle firms such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), was an investor darling. Money, helped by record low interest rates, was piling into the sector as investors rushed to get an early spot inside the world's attempt to shift away from sooty fossil fuels into the new era of clean and renewable energy."", ""However, since the invasion started, global macroeconomic conditions have meant that high growth and high risk sectors such as electric vehicle stocks are now facing an environment they haven't contended with before. Higher rates mean that investors demand more bang for the buck for their money, and EV stocks such as Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) are left at a disadvantage since they are in the early stages of their business expansion and therefore find it difficult to rake in bottom line profits. In fact, Lucid's shares are down by 62% over the past year as the luxury electric vehicle manufacturer finds itself facing the same set of manufacturing and production problems that Tesla had to face as it valiantly attempted to scale up production."", ""While we'll get into some of the problems that electric vehicle stocks are facing in a bit, their turmoil aren't helped by the fact that consumers are growing wary of cars of a new kind that are still quite young when we consider the established nature of the internal combustion automobile industry.

Well, the tighter financial conditions since the Russian invasion mean that consumers find it more difficult to finance pricey EV purchases, right at the time when car manufacturers have invested billions of dollars of capital in an industry that many believe does not have an upward limit to its demand.

However, industry insiders believe that despite Musk rapidly calling for a vote to decide matters after he was denied the pay package, Tesla is yet to set the date for a shareholder vote since its board might not be adequately independent of Musk.

That gain beats the S&P 500's return by a wide margin."", 'Is it time to buy this top automotive stock and hold it for the long term?', ""GM's revenue in the fourth quarter was essentially flat compared to the year-ago period. However, net income rose 5.4%. And for the full year, the company's sales of $172 billion climbed 9.6% versus 2022. Management also provided upbeat guidance that pleased Wall Street analysts. Executives forecast net income to increase by 4% in 2024."", ""It's worth pointing out that GM sold 943,000 units in Q4, which was down from 967,000 in prior-year period.

It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the book value per share.', 'In value investing, it is a common practice to pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally strong. There are a number of investment styles for finding great stocks at attractive values.', 'While considering valuation metrics, though price-to-earnings and price-to-sales are the first choices, the P/B ratio is also emerging as a convenient tool for identifying low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.', ""Here's the formula for P/B ratio:"", 'P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.', 'The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Company, Unum Group, Compañía Cervecerías Unidas S.

Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company's balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities."", ""It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders' equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company's balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value."", 'By comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.', 'A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.', 'For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.', ""But there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock's price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock."", 'Moreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.', 'In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number.

He calls Choice a ""win-win"" situation.', 'If Choice\'s acquisition of Wyndham Hotels & Resorts (WH) is approved, Bellisario sees significant synergy given that ""bigger is better"" in the hotel franchising industry. Even if the deal fails, he values Choice\'s ""stand-alone"" plan due to its strong balance sheet and earnings recovery.', 'Bellisario notes brands like Marriott (MAR) and Hilton (HLT) benefit from business travel loyalty.

We'll talk about picking some more hotel stocks. And, Sozzi, stay with us here because you just mentioned the three bullish indicators that you are watching when it comes to the best plays. Well, that rebound in corporate travel, it's also a key theme that analysts are watching. It could have a big impact on the travel industry's winners and losers."", ""Let's dive into it as part of our Yahoo Finance's Travel Guide 2024 industry insights. We are diving into which is the better potential play for your portfolio when it comes to hotels, when it comes to Airbnb. Here, as part of that, we want to bring in Michael Bellisario. He's Baird, a senior research analyst, along with Brian Sozzi still with us here."", ""Michael, let's talk about those names that are best positioned. So Soz just laid it out. Buybacks and dividends expansion plans, also aggressive management style, it sounds like. To him, at least, separates the winners and the losers. One of those names, Choice Hotels, I believe, is your top pick. What do you like about Choice Hotels, and what do you see in terms of that upside?"", ""- Thanks. Good morning. Yeah, with Choice, as you mentioned, they've gone hostile trying to acquire Wyndham. Our view on the stock is it's sort of a win-win. If the deal goes through-- and it's really up to the FTC at this point-- both companies have exhausted all avenues of from choice for their attempt, their hostile attempt, and Wyndham from their defense."", ""If the deal goes through, there's lots of synergies. Bigger is better in the hotel franchising business, and I think the public market is discounting lots of risks. And ultimately, I think, one to two years out post deal, people are going to be saying bigger is better. Look at all these synergies. They're going to be able to deliver, and they're going to be able to buy back even more stock."", ""And if the deal doesn't go through, we like the Choice standalone plan-- the recovery and earnings-- and their balance sheet's in phenomenal shape, and they're going to be able to buy back a ton of stock at a discount. So we view it as a win-win. It's very much an idiosyncratic story and call that we're making, but that's the setup we see for CHH today."", ""- Michael, some folks I've talked to on the Choice Hotels-Wyndham battle suggest that this-- Choice wants to make this deal to compete on loyalty with the Marriott and Hilton. Get more rewards members. Why not just go into a Marriott or Hilton, which are just larger companies? Are those the better plays?"", ""- Well, bigger is better. That includes loyalty. I think when you think about the hotel brand business, it's all about one plus one is greater than two. When you have more dots on the map, owners are happier because more demand comes through the direct channels. Developers have a greater incentive to convert or build hotels, and guests have more options to stay in, and there's a nice flywheel there."", ""It's a different customer base for Wyndham and Choice in the lower-end chain scales than for Hilton and Marriott. The Hilton and Marriott customer, a lot of times the business traveler is earning his or her points and then redeeming them at aspirational resort properties. There aren't that many of those within Choice and Wyndham's portfolio, and a lot of the rewards for Choice and Wyndham are something to the extent of, stay nine nights, get the 10th free. A little bit more of an immediate reward."", ""But yes, bigger is better, and that includes the loyalty system. And I think when you look at Marriott and Starwood when that deal closed in 2016 and now Marriott just hitting 200 million loyalty members, they can leverage that platform. You see it with what Hilton and Marriott are doing with their credit card agreements. They're taking the people and their most loyal guests, and they're creating ancillary fee streams and profit streams that are very, very valuable and very sticky."", ""- Michael, take us to the other side of the trade here too. When you think of Expedia, of course, parent company of Vrbo, and then you've got Airbnb. What levers can they pull in this environment where we were laying out some of the pipelines that Marriott and Hilton have that they're going to be continuing to bring to market, whereas the other two are really focused on just making sure that people are listing their properties."", ""- Yeah. There's a much greater focus on the supply side there. So when you think about booking Expedia and Airbnb, very much focused on the leisure traveler. Leisure travel continues to normalize. I know that's an overused word, but people are still traveling. People are still spending money."", ""Yes, the growth rate is slowing-- I know you played the clip from Peter-- but it's still positive, and it's still good, and travel broadly is gaining greater share of people's wallet. They're not buying houses and they're not buying washers and dryers anymore. They're spending on other things, whereas the hotel brands, particularly Hilton, Hyatt, and Marriott, they benefit from business travel still recovering and large citywide groups and conventions still recovering too."", ""So there's much more of a business tilt to the demand side of the pie for the hotel brands, which is why the stock prices are still performing the way that they are."", '- All right, Michael Bellisario, Baird senior research analyst.

How can we play the hospitality trade? Joining us now as part of Yahoo Finance's Travel Guide 2024, Industry Insights, we've got our very own executive editor Brian Sozzi."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: All right, when it comes to making money in the biggest hotel names in 2023, it was a relatively easy endeavor. Ride most all of the stocks because revenue per available room was rocking as hotel operators pushed through higher prices with traveling roaring back. However, in recent weeks, we have gotten new wrinkles to investing in hotel stocks mostly due to cautious commentary from booking sites, Expedia and Booking Holdings. Take a listen to what Expedia CEO, who is outgoing, told us about current demand trends.', ""PETER KERN: The markets are slowing a bit, the travel market. It's still growing, but the post-COVID thing is slowing down a bit. So the acceleration is lower. Really Asia and Latin America have been driving this past year more than anything and that's all slowing down. You know, it's really just a decel of the whole globe back to sort of more normal post-COVID levels."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: All right, so what does this all mean to investors in the hotel space? It means investors have to move beyond the outsized focus on revenue per available room and look for bullish company-specific attributes. And we, of course, have your guide for that one. I think the other way of looking at this is you actually have to do some work this year, guys, to find a good hotel stock. Luckily for you, I'm going to tee this up and it's all free."", 'So three bullish indicators. First up, hotels that are buying back a ton of stock and paying dividends. Usually, I think in this environment where things are slowing down, these are the shareholder-friendly actions you would like to see.', 'I look at Hilton. I look at Marriott. Hilton last year, $2 and a half billion given back in terms of capital to shareholders, eyeing $3 billion this year.', ""Marriott, real whopping number here, guys. $4 billion in capital returned to shareholders last year. That's dividend and stock buybacks. Looking at about $4.1 to $4.3 billion this year. So lots of good things there from both of those companies."", 'Bullish indicator number two, hotels that are aggressively building pipelines. Not pipelines to underground stations, it is pipelines to opening more rooms. Hilton added more than 130,000 rooms to its pipeline in 2023, looking to add even more rooms this year.', ""You have Marriott added 164,000 rooms to its development pipeline in 2023. Right now that company's pipeline stands at a record 573,000 rooms. That's just a massive number, guys."", ""And the last bullish indicator number three, hotel leadership teams staying hungry for more. I love execs that are just going for it all. They're not hungry with prior success."", ""That's just my thing and I love seeing this. And I see it really in three names, Marriott like I've mentioned here. I look at that company's executive team pushing into Las Vegas finally with a new MGM loyalty deal that will probably boost the loyalty program for Marriott, which is already industry leading."", ""Choice Hotels, I love that this company has gone hostile for Wyndham and Wyndham is saying, no, no, we don't want you. Well, they may not have a choice because that deal might actually get done. And then lastly Hilton, they recently signed an interesting deal with small luxury hotels of the world to push deeper into the luxury market, a new arena for them, luxurious vacation. So again, some three indicators here you want to be looking for if you want to pick some hotel stocks.""]"

Decision-making is highly centralized in the country, which hinders the transparency of the approval process of foreign direct investment.', 'Spain is among the top 15 countries with economic growth or debt problems in 2024. Its GDP growth rate slowed down in 2023 because of falling consumption, shortages of raw materials, tightening financial conditions, rising financial burdens on companies and households, and the impact of inflation. The global financial crisis, structural weaknesses in its economy, and high fiscal deficits have landed the country on the list of those with high debt-to-GDP ratios.\xa0', ""Compared to other developed nations, Canada's productivity levels remain relatively low, limiting its GDP growth. The country also has one of the highest household debt-to-GDP ratios among the G7 nations, with three-quarters of this debt tied to mortgages. This coupled with the rapid rise in housing prices in the country is putting a strain on its economy. In addition, Canada has an aging population, which could further decrease its productivity in the future. It also has an overall high debt-to-GDP ratio which is a result of its high corporate debt burdens and high combined federal and provincial debts.\xa0"", ""A significant rise in government spending has fueled higher debt levels in Brazil. In addition, its economy faces challenges such as corruption, slack demand, high inflation, and interest rates, all of which have impacted economic growth and fiscal stability. Brazil's growth model has relied on factor accumulation rather than productivity-led growth. Its productivity levels in manufacturing and services remain below those of several Latin American countries, limiting sustainable economic growth and potentially contributing to the high debt-to-GDP ratio."", 'Portugal is 10th on our list of the 15 countries with economic growth or debt problems in 2024. Although debt levels in the country are declining, its debt-to-GDP ratio remains above 100.

Its national debt currently exceeds $34 trillion because of deficit spending, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the issuance of government bonds to finance deficits. Some of the reasons for the slowdown of GDP include lower tax receipts during economic downturns, increased safety net spending, and higher budget deficits in the recent past. The country's government has consistently spent more money than it earns from taxes since 2001. In addition, rising interest rates can increase the cost of servicing the debt, impacting government finances and potentially slowing down economic growth.\xa0"", ""France is among the top 10 countries with economic growth or debt problems in 2024. The country's lagging competitiveness and slow growth have impacted France's ability to effectively manage its debt-to-GDP ratio.

Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Exelon, it has a TSR of 22% for the last 5 years.

This suggests an expectation of same dividend payments over the next 12 months.', ""Over the past three years, M&T Bank Corp's annual dividend growth rate was 5.70%.

The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-12-31, M&T Bank Corp's dividend payout ratio is 0.33."", ""M&T Bank Corp's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers.

The company has reported positive net income for each of year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability."", ""To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. M&T Bank Corp's growth rank of 6 out of 10 suggests that the company has a fair growth outlook."", ""Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and M&T Bank Corp's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. M&T Bank Corp's revenue has increased by approximately 6.70% per year on average, a rate that underperforms than approximately 51.1% of global competitors."", ""The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, M&T Bank Corp's earnings increased by approximately 17.10% per year on average, a rate that underperforms than approximately 36.64% of global competitors."", ""Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 4.60%, which underperforms than approximately 63.92% of global competitors."", ""In conclusion, M&T Bank Corp's consistent dividend payments and growth over the years, combined with a moderate payout ratio and profitability, position it as a potentially attractive option for income-focused investors. While the growth metrics present a mixed picture, the company's established market presence and historical performance could offer reassurance. Investors considering M&T Bank Corp for its dividend prospects should weigh these factors in the context of their individual investment strategies and market conditions. Will M&T Bank Corp continue its dividend aristocrat streak, and how will its growth metrics influence future payouts?

In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$260.2m', 'US$312.0m', 'US$341.1m', 'US$515.5m', 'US$513.0m', 'US$514.9m', 'US$519.8m', 'US$526.8m', 'US$535.4m', 'US$545.2m', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x6', 'Analyst x6', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 0.37%', 'Est @ 0.95%', 'Est @ 1.35%', 'Est @ 1.63%', 'Est @ 1.83%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.7% ', 'US$239', 'US$264', 'US$266', 'US$369', 'US$338', 'US$312', 'US$290', 'US$270', 'US$253', 'US$237', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.8b', ""We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.7%."", 'Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$545m× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (8.7%– 2.3%) = US$8.7b', 'Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$8.7b÷ ( 1 + 8.7%)10= US$3.8b', 'The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$6.6b.

You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Helmerich & Payne as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.395. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.', ""Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD).

We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$262m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.1% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large.

Thank you for joining us on our Q3 FY '24 call. I'm pleased to report that we delivered exceptional performance across the board despite an uncertain macro environment. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guidance driven by the momentum of our expanded all-flash product portfolio. This strength, coupled with continued operational discipline, yielded company all-time highs, for consolidated gross margin, operating margin and EPS for the second consecutive quarter. Entering FY '24, we laid out a plan to drive better performance in our storage business, and build a more focused approach to our public cloud business while managing the elements within our control in an uncertain macro economy to further improve our profitability. These actions have delivered strong results to date support our raised outlook for the year and enhance our position for the long term. Only NetApp delivers a comprehensive architecture based on a single operating system that supports any application or data type, spans on-premises and multiple cloud environments and is available in traditional CapEx or as-a-service procurement models. Our unified data solutions address some of the biggest priorities IT organizations face today. Modernizing legacy infrastructure, improving resiliency against ransomware attacks and building scalable, high-performance data pipelines for AI workloads. The consistent operations, common management tools, integrated data services and unique and proven capabilities for hybrid cloud of our unified storage architecture, provides customers the ability to simplify its scale and lower storage costs. Our Silo-free approach to unify data storage is clearly resonating with customers, driving healthy demand for our products and services and positioning us well to deliver long-term growth. Turning to the results of the quarter. We delivered robust year-over-year performance in our hybrid cloud segment with revenue growth of 6% and product revenue growth of 10%, driven by momentum from our newly introduced all-flash products and the go-to-market changes we made at the start of the year. Strong customer demand for our industry-leading all-flash solutions drove all-flash growth of 21% year-over-year to an all-time high annualized revenue run rate of $3.4 billion. In Q3, our all-flash business expanded to approximately 60% of hybrid cloud segment revenue. As Mike will detail, we expect a sustainable step-up in our baseline product gross margin going forward with the continued revenue shift to all-flash. The AFF C Series all-flash arrays, again exceeded our expectations, delivering new to NetApp customers and numerous wins over the competition. As customers modernize legacy 10K hard disk drives and hybrid flash environments, we are displacing competitors' installed bases with our all-flash solutions driving share gains. Our newly introduced ASA families of SAN-optimized high-performance and capacity-oriented all-flash arrays also outperformed our expectations. We are excited about the enormous potential in the nearly $20 billion SAN market. Our modern all-flash SAN arrays backed by industry-leading data availability and efficiency guarantees are well positioned to redefine the competitive landscape. In Q3, we had numerous competitive takeouts across a broad set of workloads and vertical markets as customers leveraged our C series and the ASC products to modernize their legacy infrastructures and deploy new applications like artificial intelligence. We continue to see strong interest in our advanced portfolio of ransomware protection solutions. We help customers take proactive steps to protect, detect and recover their data. Competitive solutions focus only on data recovery, but NetApp keeps data protected and secured from the start with products designed to block cybersecurity risk and mitigate the high cost of downtime. ONTAP is the first enterprise-class storage solution, validated by the NSA for the Commercial Solutions for Classified program, demonstrating the strength of our state-of-the-art data protection and cybersecurity solutions. We saw good momentum in AI with dozens of customer wins in the quarter, including several large NVIDIA super pod and base pod deployments. We help organizations in use cases that range from unifying their data in modern data lakes to deploying large model training environments and to operationalize those models into production environments. To best take advantage of generative AI capabilities, customers are looking to augment foundational models with their own data. Our high-performance, scalable unified data storage systems create intelligent data pipelines that allow customers to capture, aggregate and prepare their data for AI. NetApp delivers the data management capabilities for security, performance and simplicity that enterprises require for their Gen AI workflows. We continue to advance our position with the development of Gen AI-driven cloud and on-premises solutions in partnership with industry leaders. Demand for consumption options is also growing as some customers look to increase budget flexibility in an ongoing uncertain macro and higher interest rate environment. However, this is not a universal mandate. Our unified data storage solutions are available as CapEx, as-a-service and cloud native offerings providing customers with our widest range of buying options, enabling them to meet their budget requirements. Keystone, our Storage-as-a-Service offering delivered another strong quarter with revenue growing triple digits from Q3 a year ago. Keystone is a great solution for customers who want a cloud-like operating model on premises. For customers who are ready to move to the cloud, we uniquely partner with the leading hyperscalers to deliver cloud-native storage services. Public cloud segment revenue was $151 million, up 1% year-over-year. First party and hyperscaler marketplace storage services remain our priority and are growing rapidly with the ARR of these services up more than 35% year-over-year. These offerings are highly differentiated and tightly aligned to customer buying preference. We continue to deepen our hyperscaler partnerships and deliver growth in customer count, capacity, revenue and ARR with this part of the portfolio. As I outlined last quarter, we are taking action to sharpen our approach to our public cloud business. As a part of this plan, we exited two small services in the quarter. We also began the work of refocusing Cloud Insights and in and Instaclustr to complement and extend our hybrid cloud storage offerings and integrating some stand-alone services into the core functionality of cloud volumes to widen our competitive moat. In Q4, we anticipate approximately $20 million in ARR headwinds from non-renewed subscriptions. This will create minimal revenue impact and should be largely offset by growth in first-party and marketplace services. We will continue refining our focus in fiscal year '25, building a strong base from which to grow. Our hyperscaler partnerships and natively integrated storage services position us to address the new and emerging Gen AI opportunity in the cloud. A leading open source developer of Gen AI tools, data sets and models is leveraging AWS's FSX for NetApp ONTAP as a part of its offerings. The customer was looking for a high performance and resilient file storage solution to train extensive AIML workloads. FSXN gave them a scalable solution with performance storage for intensive AI model training. As a fully managed service, FSXN removes operational burdens, allowing their DevOps teams to focus on business value activities. In summary, we entered the final quarter of fiscal year '24 in a much stronger position than we were at the start of the year despite the ongoing macro uncertainty, our modern approach to unified data storage, which spans data types, price points and hybrid multi-cloud environments is resonating in the market. We are successfully executing against our top priorities, growing in all-flash and cloud storage services. We are well positioned with an expanded TAM, including block storage, and new market opportunities like AI to drive continued growth and share gains. We are moving to a higher product margin profile, supported by growth in all-flash products. And we will continue to maintain the operating discipline that has yielded record profitability. I'm very pleased with our momentum and very confident in our ability to deliver positive outcomes for customers and stockholders. Finally, I want to make you aware of our June 11, Investor Day, where we will provide an update on our long-term strategy and business model. Now I'll turn the call over to Mike."", 'Michael J. Berry', ""Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, all numbers I will discuss today are non-GAAP, unless otherwise noted. Our focus and strong execution again delivered record-setting results, reaching all-time highs across key profitability measures, including consolidated gross margin, product gross margin, operating margin, net income and EPS. Before I discuss the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As George noted, we continue to see positive results from our new all-flash products and the go-to-market changes we implemented at the start of the fiscal year. The momentum from our industry-leading flash portfolio, coupled with our operational discipline, drove both top and bottom line growth in the quarter. Q3 consolidated gross margin of 73% and product gross margin of 63% were both at all-time highs for the second consecutive quarter. Gross margin leverage and operating discipline drove operating margin of 30% and EPS of $1.94, both also setting company records for the second consecutive quarter. Q3 operating cash flow came in at $484 million, and free cash flow was $448 million. We expect operating cash flow for the full year to be at least $1.3 billion, tracking relatively in line with net income. The strong execution of our priorities of winning in flash and growing first-party cloud services are clearly paying off. Given our strong execution of results that met or beat our guidance ranges, while driving record-setting profitability measures for the second consecutive quarter, we are once again raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. Looking ahead, we are even more confident in our position to drive long-term revenue growth and profitability.Now to the details of the quarter. Q3 billings increased 7% year-over-year to $1.7 billion and revenue increased 5% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, driven by momentum in our all-flash array product families. Hybrid cloud revenue increased 6% year-over-year to $1.5 billion and product revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $747 million. Support revenue grew 2% year-over-year to $631 million. We are pleased with the success of moving the responsibility for the majority of our renewals to the customer success team implemented as a part of our go-to-market focus. Public cloud revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $151 million. As expected, Growth was driven by our first party and marketplace cloud storage services offset by declines in subscription services. Now for our operating results. Q3 consolidated gross margin was 73%. Gross profit margin dollars increased 14% year-over-year to $1.2 billion driven by strong growth of product gross profit dollars. Q3 product gross margin of 63% was 250 basis points higher than the high end of our guide, primarily driven by better-than-expected mix shift to all-flash products and pricing discipline in what remains a cost-sensitive environment. Operating expenses of $682 million increased 5% year-over-year and declined slightly from Q2 as expected. As a result of operating leverage and disciplined management, Q3 operating profit dollars increased 30% year-over-year to $485 million and operating margin increased 580 basis points from a year ago to 30%, a record for the second consecutive quarter. EPS grew 42% year-over-year to a record high of $1.94. Our tax rate was 18%, lower than expected due to an adjustment of our full year tax rate. Normalizing for a tax rate of 21.5%, EPS would still have been a record high of $1.86. Q3 operating cash flow of $484 million was up 28% year-over-year, and free cash flow was up 40% year-over-year, driven by solid billings and profitability. DSL was 45% and inventory turns were 14, both consistent with expectations. Year-to-date operating cash flow of $1.1 billion increased 23% year-over-year. During the quarter, we returned $203 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $526 million in net cash. Year-to-date, we have generated $963 million in free cash flow and returned more than 100% to stockholders. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q3 was $4.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. Before moving to Q4 and fiscal '24 guidance, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our product gross margin expectations going forward. We have seen the price increases on NAND from suppliers, and these increases will impact all industry participants. The mix shift to our higher-margin all-flash products will partially offset the headwinds from these price increases going forward. As a result of our shift to all-flash, we expect product gross margin to expand to the upper 50% to 60% from our historical norm of approximately 55%. Please note, in any given quarter, commodity prices, product mix, and the pricing environment will cause product gross margin to fluctuate from this new baseline. That being said, I want to make sure to reiterate this point. Even with the increase in commodity costs, we fully expect our product gross margins to expand to the upper 50% to 60% level driven by the shift to our all-flash portfolio. Now let's turn to guidance. As George noted, we are pleased with the results of our focus and continued operational discipline. Given our better-than-expected results and our improved outlook for Q4, we are again raising our fiscal '24 revenue guidance to a range of $6.185 billion to $6.335 billion or $6.26 billion at the midpoint. We expect to see continued strength in all-flash products and hyperscaler first-party and marketplace services. Fiscal '24 consolidated gross margin is expected to be in the range of 71% to 72%. Product gross margin is expected to be approximately 60% driven by the continued favorable mix shift to all-flash products. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 27% and EPS to be in the range of $6.40 to $6.50, with the assumption of net interest income of approximately $40 million and share count of 212 million shares. Our full year tax rate is projected to be 20%. We expect operating cash flow for the full year to be at least $1.3 billion. In Q4, we expect revenue to range between $1.585 billion and $1.735 billion, which at the midpoint of $1.66 billion implies an increase of 5% year-over-year. We expect Q4 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 71% and product gross margin to be approximately 60%. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 27% to 28%. Implied in this guidance, we expect operating expenses to increase from Q3 due mainly to higher incentive compensation, the timing of marketing programs and targeted investment to drive key product road map items. Our tax rate is expected to be 20% and EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.73 to $1.83. Also, please note that our purchase commitments for NAND for fiscal '25 demand will impact our cash flow and balance sheet in Q4 which is included in our updated cash flow forecast and will result in inventory turns to be in the 8x to 10x range. In closing, I want to thank our customers, partners, employees and stockholders for their unwavering commitment and investment in NetApp. We continue to prove our ability to manage the elements within our control and our solid top line results demonstrate the value that customers realize from our products and services. Our innovative portfolio is well aligned to priority IT investments and we remain committed to delivering sustainable long-term value for our stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q&A. Kris?"", 'Kris Newton', ""Thanks, Mike. Operator, let's begin the Q&A."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions). Today's first question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley."", 'Meta A. Marshall', ""Great. Thank you and congrats on the quarter. I guess George, you went into a lot of detail just around what you're seeing on the AI side. I guess if you could just get a sense of when you're seeing the timing of maybe people making investments versus -- kind of the various stages of AI? And then maybe just as a follow-up question, just what you're seeing in terms of the competitive environment just in terms of kind of innovative thinking around AI solutions."", 'George Kurian', ""Thank you for your question. I think we're in the early phases of the Gen AI opportunity. As you know, we have been in the AI market for a long time and have seen a lot of examples of proven use cases in predictive AI. We are starting to see the early phases of generative AI. And what I mean by that is customers collecting and unifying their data and starting to augment the foundational models with their own data, so that it is more relevant to their business. We expect that to continue for several months or a year, and we think that the deployment of production models and the movement from training to inferencing, becomes more relevant as we head into next year. With regard to the work that we have seen, we've had a really strong quarter in the flash business. And several 8-figure deals in Q3, one of the world's largest oil and gas companies built their AI supercomputer and NetApp, one of the world's largest genomics company relying on our technology to speed up genomic analysis with NVIDIA and NetApp. One of the world's largest media companies is using us to drive some of the early phases of their generative AI work. And we also have examples in the public cloud where one of the world's largest open source model providers is using NetApp's cloud technology to enable their customers to access and train their models. So we've got real many different examples of success. I think if you draw out our strength is scale and performance, super part certification, the fact that we can build a hybrid cloud data pipeline and the data management capabilities that we've had for many years that allow you to do things like model versioning, security for your mission-critical data and be able to deploy and connect data pipelines from production back into training. So I feel really good about our strength in the AI market. It's early around Gen AI, and we are doing the work to expand our opportunity there."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""This is Eddie for Krish. Congrats on the great execution here. George, I think many people still underappreciate how file services is an AI beneficiary. For example, if you set up an AWS SageMaker account, developers can have plenty of file services options, including NetApp's FSX, so maybe talk about what differentiates FSX versus other file services, and what kind of customers you attract, what use cases is it used for? And if you can touch on how big ANF and FSX are within public cloud, that would be great. I do have another question, please."", 'George Kurian', ""First of all, I think that unstructured data is the vast majority of the value in generative AI. Generative AI really operates on documents and objects and videos and images and a variety of those data sets. And as you know, NetApp has a huge percentage of the enterprises unstructured data stored on our systems. We help them in a few different ways. One way that we help them is if their data science team that's building AI training and building some of their models, wants to start in the public cloud you can very quickly and easily take data from your enterprise environment securely into the public cloud and use it in the public cloud. Second, as you know, we have very high performance scale-out solutions like the one that we referred to on the call, where one of the world's largest open source model providers is using our high-performance scale-out SSX solutions on Amazon to do model training. And then the third is in the enterprise itself, if the enterprise wants to scale that production environment, we have certifications with NVIDIA, for example, that allows them to quickly build a super part with us, train it and then deploy the trained models into production. So we feel very, very confident about the expanding opportunity in front of us. We've had several good wins and we are investing to expand our opportunity in this space."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""That's very helpful, George. And one for Mike quickly. Can you refresh please our memory about how customer behavior has historically changed when NAND prices increase aggressively in short periods of time. like do they usually reduce purchases of all-flash arrays and go more to hybrids? Or is NAND a small percentage of the bill of materials today, because of a very low pricing, where a 50% increase in net prices, for example, will not meaningfully change the system price you guys charge customers. That's it for me. Thank you."", 'Michael J. Berry', ""Yes. Eddie, there was a lot of questions in there. What we'd say is a couple of things. Remember, customers budget based on dollars, and that's the way that they purchased. We haven't seen anything like in the last year in terms of really NAND prices declining as much as they did. More than anything, we think that, that has made SSD flash technology more affordable, all the benefits that you get around environmentals and economics as well as energy now make that a much better economic decision for them. So that's really the change that we've seen. Short term -- other short-term changes really don't change the market that much because, again, these are long-term decisions companies are making."", 'George Kurian', ""And just to add to that, SSDs are not 50%. They are less than 50% of our bill of materials or probably anybody else's bill of materials."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.', 'Joseph Lima Cardoso', ""This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. So first one for me. It seems like you continue to see strong momentum with the C Series and the other new flash products that you guys have introduced and they even appear to be outperforming your expectation in each quarter. So just curious if you could talk to how momentum for those products have tracked through 3Q and into 4Q to date. It doesn't sound like you're seeing any signs of that momentum slowing down, but can you just confirm that. And do you expect that we're still very much in the early innings of these product cycles with your customers? And then I have a follow-up."", 'George Kurian', ""Yes. Maybe I can address that in three ways. I think the C Series product cycle is to modernize both traditional hybrid flash systems as well as deploy new private cloud environments, and we are seeing strong advantages there. That's the first use case. And you can see we do not see any end to that. The 10-K drive transition is a multiyear transition. We're in the early stages of that. On the private cloud side, I think some of the changes in licensing that some of the software vendors have, have renewed interest in our technology as a vehicle to give them -- give customers a path to the future. The second opportunity is the ASA product family. NetApp has had a long history in the block storage space, we've had tens of thousands of customers using our technology to serve block workloads, and we are in the early innings of bringing out a package solution that's focused solely on the block market. And we've been pleased with both of those use cases. And then the third area, of course, which is set for rapid expansion and growth is AI. And I feel really, really good with the focus and execution. Every time we've set a set of targets internally, we've been them and we've raised them externally. And so we got strong momentum. We're going to stay focused and disciplined in our execution going forward."", 'Joseph Lima Cardoso', ""Got it. I appreciate the color there, George. And then just as my second one, appears the appetite from customers to consume storage more on a consumption basis is increasing based on our checks with the channel as well as comments from you and your peers. I know you touched on the driver being in some part due to this uneven macro that we're seeing. But are you seeing anything else as a driver there, like the maturity around the offerings or go-to-market motion. The reason I'm asking, it just feels like it wasn't too long ago when the opportunity here felt more theoretical and there was not as much appetite coming from the customers. So I would just be interested to hear, like has anything changed on that front?"", 'George Kurian', ""I think there's probably two or three things. I think the maturity of the offerings, I think customers comfort around how they would procure cloud-like models. I think the second is the increase in interest rates that on the margin caused certain customers to think about CapEx versus OpEx. And then the third, of course, is the customers that are in transition from one environment to another. For example, when you're in a data center transition and you've got a portion of the life of a data center environment that needs to be continued moving to an as-a-service model is a good transition point. We have offered as a service for many years. Clearly, the most flexible, the fastest and the easiest to build an elastic environment is around true public cloud. We also have solutions with colocation providers like Equinix that allows the customer to get a full cloud-like opportunity in a colocation environment connected to the public cloud and our Keystone service in the customers' data centers had another really strong quarter. We are up year-to-date almost more than triple digits, including this past quarter. So we see strong momentum in that category. And we do not see a mandate for it, but it's a nice new way for us to address a set of customer buying preferences."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions). Next question today comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.', 'Mehdi Hosseini', 'George, I just wanted to better understand the current competitive landscape for fiber storage market, especially given the AI application. And I have a follow-up.', 'George Kurian', ""It's always been competitive. There are different vendors that come and go in the market. I think if you look at the installed base of unstructured data, that becomes the vehicle to build data pipelines for AI and ML applications, NetApp has a very strong position. And we have the only solutions that allow customers to build hybrid cloud pipelines to build solutions that are super scalable and high performance. But also have the security protection and data management that AI will need as these models get scaled. So I feel really good about our position and look forward to continuing to expand our presence in that market."", 'Mehdi Hosseini', ""Maybe perhaps I could rephrase my question. Mike just raised is product gross margin to 60%, which is pretty much what you're guiding for the January quarter. You're also increasing use of QLC. So should we anticipate some flexibility with pricing that QLC gives you by remaining competitive with your competitors? Because I don't see gross margins already at work the new target is. So where do we go from here?"", 'George Kurian', ""Listen, I think that, first of all, the mix shift from hard drives to flash in our business continues. And it's an important kind of underlying factor that gives us confidence that we are raising the structural baseline product gross margin, as Mike said, from the mid-50s, which has been our historic norm to the upper 50s and up to 60%. The mix shift is the most important lever in that equation. The second, of course, is the value of our ONTAP software and the ongoing management of the commodity supply chain. I think all of those factor in. I think that we are uniquely positioned with our operating system to benefit from using QLC in a broad bench of applications. Currently, only another one other vendor has QLC-based all-flash arrays, and it gives us an opportunity to go target other vendors who don't have QLC support. So we feel really good about our solution. And I would tell you that AI and all of these enterprise applications are not just about price, right? They're about value, and we built a real good value for our customers over many years."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'This is Mike Cadiz for Asiya at Citi. So my one question is, given ongoing -- in the AI field, given ongoing security and data sovereignty concerns by many companies, is there anything notable in your customer conversations regarding AI model placements, whether on-prem or in the cloud or any other architecture preferences that they may have?', 'George Kurian', ""Listen, I think that data is the foundation on which AI is built. And if you look at what enterprises are doing today, they are augmenting foundational models with their own data to bring the relevance of AI to their business and their organizational needs. As a result, issues like malicious injection of bad data into a data landscape can cause huge impacts on AI, the ability to maintain data security, privacy, and lineage is are all conversations that are happening regardless of the regulatory environment, and they will only get stronger as the regulations get enforced like you are seeing, for example, in the European Union. This gives the needs to have data management across the life cycle of AI extreme importance, and we are exceptionally well positioned, having the capabilities to build secure private environments in the public cloud as well as in customers' data centers."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets.', 'Nehal Sushil Chokshi', ""Congrats on the strong results here. Mike, can you give us some early thoughts on fiscal year '25. And what are the key things we should be thinking about when modeling fiscal year '25 here?"", 'Michael J. Berry', ""Yes. Thank you for the question, Nehal. Sorry about that. So when going into fiscal '25, we've talked about it, hey, we feel really good about the momentum that we have in Q3 as well as the guidance that we built in Q4. We've talked about the momentum around C Series. George talked about all the industry trends that are also tailwinds for us. And when you look at all of the priorities that our customers are looking at, we feel like we're really well positioned. We've given you a good view of where we think our product gross margins will land. The support business continues to be an important driver of profitability as well. And we will continue to be prudent around our investment to make sure that we drive growth. We want to do that. We want to make sure that we are disciplined in our spending. But hey, there are some things that we also need to do and want to do to be able to continue to drive the top line. I think we've done a lot of great work around cloud to be in a much better position for next year. George talked about the 35%-plus growth in cloud storage in first-party marketplace and Eddie asked that question as well. In the quarter, cloud storage continues to grow as a percentage. It's now closer to 65% from a revenue perspective. So that's where the growth will be. And then, we will continue to do the right things around return of capital to shareholders. We always want to leave flexibility for investments but we also want to make sure that we're mindful of our share count. So without trying to guide '25, that's only the best readers digest version I can give you."", 'Nehal Sushil Chokshi', ""That's fantastic. If I may, how should we think about the support revenue? You're coming off 4 quarters of year-over-year product revenue declines now that you're back into year-over-year growth on the product revenue, how long do you expect the support revenue start to (inaudible) back up basically?"", 'Michael J. Berry', ""Yes, great question. And we look at this a lot, obviously. So in the last 2 quarters, we've seen deferred revenue actually decline year-over-year. A couple of things to haul. Keep in mind, that what you see on the balance sheet as a total deferred, it also includes cloud that has declined a little bit more than the support business in the last 2 quarters. 90% Plus support will come off the balance sheet, so you can take a hard look at that. But what we've also seen is a different trend where instead of tech refreshes, we've seen a lot of customers renew their support for up to a year, and that has also helped continue to drive support revenue. You don't see that as much in deferred. But the big driver will be growth in product revenue drives additional support revenue with the multiyear support. You'll see that in billings. You'll see that in deferred revenue. So we feel good about being able to get that growth and support. I think it was 2% this year, hopefully, at least that and going forward, if product -- when product revenue grows, support revenue should follow. It will be a little bit of a lagging indicator a couple of quarters, but it will definitely follow because of the business model."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.', 'Ananda Prosad Baruah', ""Yes, congrats, I mean congrats on a strong number of quarters here and really good ongoing execution. And I guess George, that's I guess what I'd like to ask, I guess the first question is -- and I'm sorry if you spoke to some of this, I was -- there's a few calls going on tonight. Sorry, I came on late. But to what degree the last couple of quarters or so, do you think that the strong product growth that you guys have put up. I'm going to try to actually parse to the degree it's parsable. Is the result of new product features, kind of new products, things that customers are doing beginning to do sort of differently with their data. It sounds like not really a material Gen AI benefit yet, which makes sense. But if you could parse -- if there's any way to parse through those things, that would be helpful. And then I guess the second part of the question is, I think I heard you make mention of you think there is like a tail to this going forward. And I mean is part of what you're saying is that you think the product demand sort of outlook begins to look a lot different as you go through calendar '24 and then maybe even beyond? I know that's a lot, but I'd appreciate that."", 'George Kurian', ""Yes. Listen, I think, first of all, the macro has stayed relatively consistent the whole time. It is uncertain. It's not getting worse, but it is not the fundamental reason for the improvement in results. The second is the two biggest reasons for improving our results. One is product and the second is focus on go-to-market execution. Let me hit on product, in terms of product, we brought the world's best operating system to 2 or 3 major new opportunities. We brought it to a price point in the all-flash market that we have not addressed before with the QLC flash offerings. We brought the world's best operating system to a block storage opportunity that's multibillion dollars, multiple tens of billion dollars that we had never built a purpose-built block storage product for. And we are continuing to see an expanding range of AI opportunities as customers are doing both training as well as building context called retrieval augmented generation drag. And so all of those have driven improvements in our results. I think the other part of the equation would be to recognize the benefits that we've had from focus in our go-to-market. We have prioritized 2 areas: the hyperscaler marketplace and first-party cloud storage services in public cloud. And we have focused on our all-flash portfolio as the two major priorities, and we have had strong results in both of them, I'm very pleased with the results."", 'Ananda Prosad Baruah', ""That's great context. I appreciate that. And just a quick follow-up for Mike here. Mike, you talked about attach in some context. And I guess I just wanted to ask you with the operating margins already in the high 20s, philosophically, is there any reason why with everything you have going on with mix and attach over time, you couldn't touch 30% operating margin?"", 'Michael J. Berry', 'So we did this quarter.', 'Ananda Prosad Baruah', ""Sorry, it's funny. I haven't -- yes, I apologize. I have to with all the numbers I had you didn't -- That's a miss on me. So well, let me just ask you then, let's start there. Like I mean, should we just expect mix up then going forward? I mean how are you thinking about like showing the margins in the P&L versus doing something else with the op income dollars as mix continues to work in your favor?"", 'Michael J. Berry', ""Yes. And no apologies necessary. I know you folks are busy today. So hey, we're super excited about the 30% margin. And a lot of that. There's all 12,000 employees that helped us on that number. We've guided to 27% to 28% in Q4. What I would say is that we very much want to continue to be able to grow the business. And even as a CFO, I know, hey, we need to invest in some areas. There are some product investments that we need to make. We want to make sure that the go-to-market continues to have sales capacity. We've said it at the last Analyst Day, we'll say it again, which is we want to invest, but our goal is always to grow OpEx at a lower rate than revenue to drive the margins up. Where those go really depends, I think, on a couple of things. One is how well we can continue to grow product revenue, that's obviously a big piece. And that then drives storage, which was Nehal's question around -- I'm sorry, around which is a big piece. So we don't have a target in mind. And quite frankly, the other thing I just want to make sure and underline, this is both gross -- product gross margins and operating margins. Hey, we love the margin percentages, but we love the dollars more. And so our goal is to be able to drive dollars.

George, you mentioned new customer wins resulting from the displacement of competitor 10K hard disk drive and hybrid deployments with C Series.

I think what we have seen quite clearly in the market is that the idea of having multiple different operating systems and storage landscapes in our customer is causing cost, complexity and security vulnerabilities and the idea of going to one consistent architecture across multiple landscapes is clearly seeing resonance in customers. And I think that as we have got obviously both unified as well as block focused offerings across high-performance AFF A Series as well as more value-oriented C-Series products, we see opportunity to not only win one part of our customers' footprint, but over time, win all of their footprint. The work that we've done in public cloud allows us to penetrate accounts that we don't have a relationship with using the public cloud sales motion. And as we have shared many times, the number of new to NetApp customers in the public cloud sales motion is very strong, and we are excited about that. We continue to see good progress on that front even this past quarter."", 'Jyhhaw Liu', 'I also had one follow-up. Just on the dip in your mix of U.S. public sector revenue. Was there anything to call out here just in terms of government IT spending?', 'George Kurian', ""It's just normal seasonality. I think public sector actually was a strong number for us across the globe and nothing other than normal seasonality for us."", 'Kris Newton', ""All right. Thanks, Urban. I'm going to pass it back to George now for some closing comments."", 'George Kurian', ""Thank you, Kris. Let me reiterate my strong confidence in our position to drive continued growth and profitability despite the uncertain macro. We've sharpened our focus, improved our execution and successfully introduced new products that expand our addressable market. Capacity flash, block storage and AI all represent enormous opportunities for us. We are performing well in these areas and expect continued growth.

This SWOT analysis delves into the financial intricacies of NetApp Inc, as revealed in the recent filing, to provide investors with a comprehensive understanding of the company's strategic position. The filing indicates that NetApp Inc has continued to capitalize on its Hybrid Cloud segment, which remains the primary revenue generator. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, the company has demonstrated resilience, with the Public Cloud segment offering new avenues for growth. Notably, NetApp Inc has managed to navigate supply chain constraints effectively, leading to a reduction in product component and freight costs. Additionally, the company's proactive restructuring efforts are aimed at optimizing resource allocation towards the most lucrative activities."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with NTAP.', ""Brand and Market Position: NetApp Inc's strength lies in its established brand and significant market position within the data management and storage industry. The company's Hybrid Cloud segment, which includes a comprehensive portfolio of storage management and infrastructure solutions, has consistently driven revenue growth. This segment's success is underpinned by NetApp's ability to help customers modernize their data centers and embrace cloud technologies, which is critical in today's digital landscape. The brand's reputation for quality and innovation has fostered a loyal customer base and has been a key differentiator in a competitive market."", ""Financial Health: NetApp Inc's financial health is a testament to its operational efficiency and strategic focus. The 10-Q filing reveals a solid balance sheet, with a notable increase in net revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period in the previous year. This growth is attributed to an uptick in product revenues, particularly from the sale of QLC-flash array systems. The company's ability to maintain a healthy cash flow, as evidenced by its cash and cash equivalents, and manage its liabilities effectively, positions it well for sustained financial stability and future investments."", ""Dependence on Specific Segments: While NetApp Inc's Hybrid Cloud segment is a significant strength, it also presents a potential weakness due to the company's reliance on this segment for the majority of its revenue. This dependence could expose NetApp to risks if the market for hybrid cloud solutions experiences a downturn or if competitors introduce disruptive technologies. Diversifying revenue streams could mitigate this risk and ensure long-term sustainability."", ""Macroeconomic Vulnerability: The global economic uncertainty and potential for a recession, as highlighted in the management's discussion in the 10-Q filing, pose a weakness for NetApp Inc. A weakened demand environment could lead to smaller deal sizes, longer selling cycles, and delays in deal closures. This vulnerability underscores the need for NetApp to adapt its sales strategies and possibly explore cost optimization measures to maintain its competitive edge during economic downturns."", ""Public Cloud Expansion: The Public Cloud segment presents a significant opportunity for NetApp Inc to diversify its revenue base and tap into the growing demand for cloud storage and CloudOps services. As organizations increasingly move towards cloud-based solutions, NetApp's portfolio of products delivered primarily as-a-service, including cloud storage and CloudOps services, positions the company to capture a larger market share and drive growth."", ""Strategic Partnerships: NetApp Inc's collaboration with leading public clouds, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, offers opportunities to expand its reach and enhance its service offerings. By leveraging these partnerships, NetApp can provide integrated solutions that meet the evolving needs of its customers, fostering innovation and potentially opening up new revenue streams."", 'Competitive Pressure: The data management and storage industry is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. NetApp Inc faces the threat of competitors introducing more innovative or cost-effective solutions that could erode its market position. Staying ahead of the competition requires continuous investment in research and development to innovate and improve product offerings.', ""Regulatory and Legal Challenges: NetApp Inc operates in a complex regulatory environment and is subject to various legal proceedings, as mentioned in the 10-Q filing. The outcome of these proceedings could have material adverse effects on the company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. It is crucial for NetApp to manage these risks proactively and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations."", 'In conclusion, NetApp Inc (NASDAQ:NTAP) exhibits a strong market position and financial health, driven by its successful Hybrid Cloud segment. However, the company must address its dependence on specific segments and vulnerability to macroeconomic fluctuations. Opportunities in the Public Cloud segment and strategic partnerships are promising areas for growth, while competitive pressures and regulatory challenges pose ongoing threats. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, NetApp Inc can capitalize on opportunities and mitigate threats to maintain its status as a leader in the data management and storage industry.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

This increase means the global beverage company provides investors with a refreshing dividend yield of more than 3%, given the stock's current price."", ""Here's a closer look at Coca-Cola's latest dividend increase, its trend of dividend growth, and why the company is likely to continue rewarding shareholders with dividend increases for years to come."", 'Coca-Cola announced its dividend increase in a Feb. 13 press release. The first quarterly dividend at the higher rate will be paid to shareholders on April 1 to shareholders of record as of March 15.', ""The new quarterly dividend amounts to $0.485, or $1.94 annually. This puts the company's dividend yield at 3.2% -- more than double the S&P 500's dividend yield of 1.4%."", 'As Coca-Cola Chief Financial Officer John Murphy stated during a conference call with analysts on Feb. 20, the extended streak of consecutive annual increases reinforces Coca-Cola\'s ""commitment"" to its dividend.', ""While it's helpful to know the details of Coca-Cola's most recent dividend increase, it's arguably more useful to look back at how the dividend has progressed over the last five to 10 years. This provides insight into both business momentum and management's commitment to dividend growth. Further, analyzing dividend growth through the challenging period of the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath -- a period in which both demand and supply were disrupted for many companies -- helps show a company's resilience (or lack thereof) to economic disruption."", ""Despite economic challenges, Coca-Cola's annual dividend growth persisted uninterrupted in recent years. Its compound average dividend growth rate over the trailing five-year and 10-year periods is about 4% and 5%, respectively. This suggests the company's latest 5.4% increase isn't too far from the norm but is at the high end of Coca-Cola's typical dividend increases."", ""Looking ahead, investors can expect more dividend increases from Coca-Cola -- and that's not just because management regularly tells investors it's committed to dividend growth. More importantly, investors can look at both the beverage company's earnings momentum and its payout ratio to determine whether or not more dividend increases are likely in the coming years. Fortunately for shareholders, both of these factors check out positively as reasons to anticipate further growth."", ""Looking to Coca-Cola's profitability trends, its 2023 earnings per share rose 13% year over year, setting the company up well for further dividend growth.\xa0Meanwhile, Coca-Cola's payout ratio (dividend payments as a percentage of earnings) for 2023 was under 75%, well below its payout ratio of about 80% in 2022. This leaves plenty of room for dividend growth in the coming years."", 'Both of these factors set Coca-Cola up well for sustained dividend growth. No wonder Murphy confidently told investors in the company\'s fourth-quarter shareholder letter that, ""Related to capital return, we have an unwavering priority to grow our dividend.""', ""Overall, the bull case for Coca-Cola remains simple: Shares likely won't provide spectacular long-term returns for shareholders, but the stock offers an exceptional risk-reward trade-off. Investors who buy the stock will get access to a durable business with a long history of success that's likely to continue for decades."", ""The stock's returns may not be particularly high in the future, but the risk for shareholders doesn't appear high, either. For these reasons, Coca-Cola's latest dividend increase is a stark reminder of why this durable business is a good long-term investment: The company seems well-positioned to reward shareholders with dividend growth over the next decade and beyond."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

The company continues to make the necessary investments to ensure it adapts to changing consumer preferences. That's a recipe for sustained success."", ""Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a stock that Buffett has mentioned he was hesitant to invest in initially, but he now regrets it.

Global material consumption is anticipated to more than double to approximately 89 billion tonnes, as reported by the UN International Resource Panel. The wealthiest nations consume 10 times more than the poorest, with consumption rates in Asia and Africa expected to grow rapidly until 2050.', ""Developing low-carbon and resource-efficient cities can help alleviate the negative effects of increased material consumption, including pollution and carbon emissions. Despite covering only 2% of the Earth's land, cities utilize over 75% of the planet's material resources. Urban expansion is forecasted to escalate global material consumption from 41.1 billion tonnes in 2010 to around 89 billion tonnes by 2050. The majority of urban growth, according to the UN, will occur in Global South cities, particularly in China, India, and Nigeria. Asia is projected to experience a significant rise in consumption due to its high concentration of megacities (cities with over 10 million inhabitants). However, the most substantial growth is anticipated in Africa over the next few decades. The continent's population is expected to double by 2050, with material consumption skyrocketing from 2 billion tonnes to 17.7 billion tonnes annually."", ""Most countries with the lowest urban populations are situated in Africa. Despite their low urban population percentages, several of these countries are undergoing rapid urbanization. For instance, Burundi has an urban population of 14.4%, which is relatively low, but it has the world's highest urbanization rate at 5.43%. Similarly, Uganda's urban population stands at 26.2%, while its urbanization rate is 5.41%. These countries are often classified among the least developed or underdeveloped nations globally."", ""With the growing population across the world, there’s a direct impact on the global food market in the world. As the world's population grows and urbanizes, the consumer food industry is facing some major supply chain hurdles, price hikes, and changing consumer preferences. This situation has led to increased costs, operational disruptions, and challenges in labor and procurement. However, it has also opened up new possibilities for companies to innovate and expand by introducing fresh products and top-notch services. The global consumer-packaged foods market is worth around $1.1 trillion currently in 2024, and is expected to hit $1.6 trillion by 2030."", ""Amidst this, and before we move on to our list of 15 Countries Where Much or Most of Population Lives in Cities, it’s significant to see what great businesses food companies are doing all across the world. Namely, we are going to discuss PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQGS:PEP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)."", ""PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQGS:PEP) is a big American company that sells food, snacks, and drinks. It's based in Harrison, New York, near Purchase. PepsiCo manages everything from making its products to getting them out there to customers. In the last quarter, they made $1.3 billion in profit, with earnings of 94 cents per share. Their sales were a bit lower than expected at $27.85 billion. This is the first time since 2020 that their sales dropped from the previous year, partly due to exchange rates and having an extra week in the prior year."", ""The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a fizzy drink made by the Coca-Cola Company.

These aircraft play a key role in securing control over enemy airspace. According to Flight Global, there were 53,265 military aircraft in the world in 2022, with a quarter (25%) of them being flown by the United States, followed by Russia (8%) and China (6%). A recent report by the Military Embedded Systems noted that about 39% of the world’s fighter jets are also operated by the United States, with China at a distant second at 24.4%. These statistics speak volumes of Washington’s aerial superiority over its rivals, which is likely to continue given the current trends.', 'Work is already underway in the United States to develop a sixth-generation fighter jet to replace the F-22 Raptor, built by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), by 2030.

The US has built 744 B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers to-date, of which about 76 are still flying today. Designed in 1952 by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), the aircraft can carry up to 32,000 kilograms of weapons, with a combat range of 14,200 kilometers without requiring aerial refueling. The B-52 has been a symbol of American strength for decades now, and was recently sent to Iraq and Syria to crush ISIS. As of 2012, the price of a B-52 Stratofortress bomber was estimated to be $84 million.', 'Around 45 B-1 Lancer bombers are also in the current fleet of the USAF. Introduced in the 1970s, these were manufactured by Rockwill International until their B-1 division was acquired by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), which has since been the primary contractor for this aircraft. The aircraft is powered by General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)’s F101-GE-102 afterburning turbofan engines.', 'The most recent bomber aircraft in use by the USAF are the B-2 Spirit, manufactured by Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) during the 1980s. About 21 units of the aircraft have been built to-date, with each unit costing around $280 million. These strategic bombers of Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) come with low-observable stealth technology which enable the bombers to penetrate even dense anti-aircraft defenses.', 'Since there are just a handful of countries that currently have bombers, we have factored in the advancement of fighter jets of different air forces to compile a list of 20. Countries that are equipped with bombers are ranked higher than those that have none. For the latter, we have considered the strength of fighter jets, with our main focus being on the number of fourth-generation and fifth-generation fighter jets operated by their air forces.

Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors.

These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated by these statements. For a more detailed description of these and other risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, and our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as our earnings press release issued today.

Nutanix will be participating in the Morgan Stanley TMT Conference in San Francisco on March 6. We hope to see some of you there. Finally, our third quarter fiscal 2024 quiet period will begin on Tuesday, April 16. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rajiv. Rajiv?"", 'Rajiv Ramaswami', ""Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a solid second quarter with results that came in ahead of our guidance. The macro backdrop in our second quarter remain uncertain, but stable relative to the prior quarter. We continue to see steady demand for our solutions driven by businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and infrastructure modernization initiatives and looking to optimize their total cost of ownership, or TCO. Taking a closer look at the second quarter, we were happy to have exceeded all of our guided metrics. We delivered record quarterly revenue of $565 million and grew our ARR 26% year-over-year to $1.74 billion. We also had another quarter of strong free cash flow generation. Finally, we achieved quarterly GAAP operating profitability for the first time in Q2, demonstrating the progress we continue to make on driving operating leverage in our subscription model. Overall, our second quarter financial performance reflected continued disciplined execution. Our largest wins in the quarter demonstrated the appeal of the Nutanix Cloud Platform to organizations that are looking to adopt hybrid multi-cloud operating models, optimize the performance of their workloads and improve their TCO, all while managing through some of the disruption from recent industry M&A. A good example is a 7-figure win with a global EMEA-based provider of automotive technology solutions. This new customer had an existing 3-tier footprint in need of a refresh, but was frustrated by the recent price increases of their incumbent vendor and was also looking to have the flexibility to potentially move some of their footprint to the public cloud in the future. They choose our Nutanix Cloud Platform, including our AHV hypervisor as well as Nutanix Cloud Management based on its superior TCO built in automation for Infrastructure as a Service and its ability to seamlessly transition workloads to public cloud via our NC2 solution. We see this win as a good example of the value customers see in our cloud platform for both modernization and providing a seamless pathway to the public cloud. A second good example is a win with a large North American-based hedge fund that was looking to mitigate the growing cost of its public cloud hosted virtual desktop infrastructure, or VDI, and for a more responsive solution to meet the performance demand of its traders. They chose to repatriate their VDI on to the Nutanix Cloud Platform on GPU-based servers, resulting in a meaningful improvement in performance and an estimated 60% plus TCO savings. We believe this win demonstrates the ability of the Nutanix Cloud Platform to seamlessly run and manage workloads wherever the optimal performance and TCO can be achieved, whether on-premise, at the edge or in the public cloud. A final example is one of our largest new customer wins in the quarter with a global airline based in the EMEA region that was looking to modernize their CTL infrastructure while enabling a hybrid multi-cloud environment. This customer chose the Nutanix Cloud Platform, including Nutanix Cloud Management, to run their business-critical applications, leveraging its simplicity and built in automation for Infrastructure as a Service. They also adopted Nutanix Database Service for managing and deploying their databases throughout their organization and Nutanix Unified Storage to service their unstructured data needs. We see this win as evidence of the value company see in adopting our full stack solution. Moving on, adopting and benefiting from generative AI is top of mind for many of our customers. As such, interest remains high in our GPT-in-a-Box offering, which enables our customers to accelerate the use of generative AI across their enterprises while keeping their data secure. Last quarter, we saw our first win for GPT-in-a-Box with a large federal agency. And this quarter, we saw multiple additional wins for our GenAI-ready infrastructure offering. While it's still early days and the numbers remain small, I'm excited about the longer-term potential for GPT-in-a-Box. Finally, on the partner front, I'm happy with the early progress we're seeing with our Cisco partnership. We continue to see good customer interest in our joint offering and saw additional wins for it in the second quarter. While it's still early in this partnership, I'm encouraged by what we've seen so far. In closing, we are encouraged that the compelling value proposition of our cloud platform and the strength of our business model enabled us to increase our top and bottom line outlook for fiscal 2024. We remain focused on delighting our customers while continuing to drive sustainable, profitable growth. And with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?"", 'Rukmini Sivaraman', ""Thank you, Rajiv. I will first review our Q2 fiscal '24 results, followed by guidance for Q3 fiscal '24 and finally provide an updated view of our full year fiscal year '24 guidance. Results in Q2 '24 came in higher than the high end of our range across all guided metrics. ACV billings in Q2 were $329 million, above the guided range of $295 million to $305 million, representing year-over-year growth of 23%. The outperformance was driven by better-than-expected renewals performance due to a combination of good discipline around renewals economics, improved on-time renewal performance as well as the early and co-term renewals. Revenue in Q2 was $565 million, higher than the guided range of $545 million to $555 million and a year-over-year growth rate of 16%. ARR at the end of Q2 was $1.737 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 26%. In Q2, we continue to see modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels. Average contract duration in Q2 was 2.8 years, slightly lower than Q1 and more or less in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 87.3%, higher than our guided range of 85% to 86%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 21.9%, higher than our guided range of 14% to 16%, largely due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses as a result of timing of hiring. Non-GAAP net income was $136 million or fully diluted EPS of $0.46 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 299 million shares. Q2 marked our first ever quarter of positive GAAP operating income of $37 million and a positive GAAP net income of $33 million with fully diluted GAAP EPS of $0.12 per share. Given expected variability in quarterly revenue and timing of expenses, we would not expect to be consistently profitable at the GAAP operating profit level over the near term. DSOs based on revenue and ending accounts receivable were 31 days in Q2. Free cash flow in Q2 was $163 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 29%, higher than our expectations due to higher billings and lower expenses in the quarter. We ended Q2 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.644 billion, up from $1.571 billion at the end of Q1. We continued repurchasing shares in Q2 under the share repurchase program previously authorized by our Board of Directors. Our sustainable generation of free cash flow enabled us to transition to net share settlement to pay for employees' tax liability on RSU vesting in Q2 and going forward from our previous method of sell to cover. This, along with our share repurchase program, will help us continue to manage dilution. Moving to Q3 '24. Our guidance for Q3 is as follows: ACV billings of $265 million to $275 million; revenue of $510 million to $520 million; non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 85%; non-GAAP operating margin of 7.5% to 8.5%; and fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 301 million shares. The updated guidance for full year fiscal year '24, which is higher than our previously provided fiscal year '24 guidance across all metrics is as follows: ACV billings of $1.09 billion to $1.11 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint of the range; revenue of $2.12 billion to $2.15 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint; non-GAAP gross margin of 85% to 86%; non-GAAP operating margin of 12.5% to 13.5%; free cash flow of $420 million to $440 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 20% at the midpoint. I will now provide some commentary regarding our updated fiscal year '24 guidance. First, we are seeing continued new and expansion opportunities for our solutions, despite the uncertain macro environment. However, as we mentioned previously, we have continued to see a modest elongation of average sales cycles relative to historical levels. Our fiscal year '24 new and expansion ACV performance outlook assumed some impact from these macro dynamics. We are also seeing a higher mix of larger deals in our pipeline, which is driving greater variability in the timing of our new and expansion business. Second, the guidance assumes that our renewals business will continue to perform well. Third, the full year guidance continues to assume that average contract duration would be flat to slightly lower compared to fiscal year '23 as renewals continue to grow as a percent of our total billings. Fourth, a reminder that the full year ACV billing is not the straight sum of the ACV billings of the 4 quarters due to contracts with duration less than 1 year. We expect full year ACV billings to be about 5% to 6% lower than the sum of the 4 quarters ACV billings. In closing, we are pleased that our Q2 results exceeded guidance and to raise our top line and bottom line guidance for the full fiscal year. We remain focused on driving growth to capture the significant opportunity ahead of us and are investing prudently for that growth consistent with our stated philosophy of sustainable, profitable growth. With that, operator, please open the line for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Jim Fish from Piper Sandler.', 'James Edward Fish', ""Awesome quarter here. Look, I'm going to ask the obvious that's on top of everybody's mind, and I'm sure you're totally prepared for. On the VMware opportunity, and Rukmini, you even just mentioned you're seeing a higher mix of larger deals in the pipeline. So my question to you is, what sort of pipeline or bookings built have you seen relative to this stage last year between either direct customers kind of coming to you or partners coming over to you as well in terms of sign-ups?"", 'Rajiv Ramaswami', ""Yes. Why don't I start, Jim, and Rukmini can give you color on the pipeline. So first of all, I think, as you said, I mean, there are significant concerns from VMware customers regarding the Broadcom acquisition. And we think that this is a significant multiyear opportunity for us to win new customers and to gain share. Now getting to your question a bit here, the timing and magnitude of these deals is a bit unpredictable. Our pipeline is quite substantial and growing. Now for a number of reasons, we expect contribution from the opportunity to build gradually, right? So -- and here are the reasons. The first one, Jim, is that many customers signed multi-year ELAs, enterprise agreement, with VMware prior to the deal closing 3 to 5 years. So it buys them some time to make decisions. The second converting from VMware 3-tier accounts or legacy storage accounts, which is a good chunk of VMware footprint, in many cases, requires a refresh of their storage and/or servers, right, 1 of the 2, which could also impact the timing of the potential software purchases that they would make with us, okay? And the last piece is like with all these accounts, we typically have a land and expand motion. So the first deal could be smaller, and then there's a lot of potential for expansion further than that. And then Rukmini, do you want to take this?"", 'Rukmini Sivaraman', ""Sure. Yes, I'll add one thing, Jim, to your question, is that I mentioned in my prepared remarks about this higher mix of larger deals that we're seeing in our pipeline. And that is driving the greater variability, we believe, in the timing of our new and expansion business as well as potentially contributing to the longer average sales cycles because larger deals do tend to take longer to close. And we believe that this higher mix of larger deals in the pipeline is driven by: one, our segmentation upmarket, as we've talked about before and the improved product readiness for those larger customers; and secondly, some of the dynamics that Rajiv talked about already regarding concerns from larger customers regarding the impacts from Broadcom's acquisition of VMware. And so we have continued and continue to factor all of the impact from some of these dynamics into our updated fiscal year '24 outlook."", 'James Edward Fish', ""Makes sense. And just a follow-up here. There's a bit of confusion out there from what I can tell in the conversations with investors between what VMware can do that Nutanix can't do? And so Rajiv, what differences actually exist, if any, or features exist? What the differences kind of exist, if any, between vSphere, for example, on Acropolis or the VMware platform versus Nutanix Platform or features functions you plan to add in order to make it an apples-to-apples compare? Or is it simply just a legacy market perception thing that you guys can't address really what most of VMware could do? And really, why wouldn't we start to see that Acropolis attach rate get closer to 100% on every deal that you signed from kind of here on forward?"", 'Rajiv Ramaswami', ""Yes. So Jim, I think, first of all, if you compare to the full stack that Broadcom was offering with BMI Cloud Foundation, that -- and our Nutanix Cloud Platform pretty much goes head-to-head against that, right? We've got all the capabilities. So that's a full stack that includes the Hypervisor, the software-defined storage, networking and management. So we compare very well, right, with that full stack and we're able to go -- do a very comparable offering. And indeed, as you can see, right, our AHV penetration -- our Hypervisor penetration in our installed base is about 70%, and we are seeing new customers who adopt our full stack start with our own hypervisor, okay? That part is correct. Now when it comes to the lower-tier offering, right, VMware does have a vSphere and now it's called, I believe, VMware Virtual Foundation, VVF, that includes vSphere or some operations management capabilities, et cetera. Now what you -- what I mentioned earlier in my -- in response to the question was that, there is some amount of VMware. In fact, a big chunk of VMware, it's only the hypervisor that's connected to legacy storage, right, 3-tier storage areas. Now the way we go after the market is not to just simply replace the hypervisor with our hypervisor, right? Because our hypervisor also is part of our complete solution, right, which includes our storage. So customers are actually making a shift from a legacy architecture that's a hypervisor plus external storage to a modern HCI architecture that includes our hypervisor, but also the rest of our stack. So there, it's not just a simple like-for-like, but it's a conversion and modernization of the infrastructure as well. So I feel pretty good about what we can do. We can handle all the workloads, we have a hybrid cloud solution, we have a modern apps platform that customers can run Kubernetes applications on We have partnerships with Red Hat for OpenShift. We have partnerships with our cloud partners like Azure and AWS. So from a capability of a portfolio perspective, we are very much there."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Jason Ader from William Blair.', 'Jason Noah Ader', ""I just wanted to ask on that kind of the follow-up thread in the last question, just on the 3-tier architectures out there and most of those running VMware today. Does it feel like this change with the Broadcom acquisition actually could accelerate the transition away from 3-tier architectures as customers maybe get a little bit disenfranchised and are looking for alternatives? And then it's like, well, we never really looked at HCI, that closely, but now maybe we should. Are those kind of conversations happening?"", 'Rajiv Ramaswami', ""Very much so, I would say, Jason. So in fact, you're right, right? There's a lot of VMware with what we call 3 tier. And one of the things that Broadcom itself has done, by the way, is that with the VMware Cloud Foundation, that includes HCI. And that their default offering to a lot of the bigger customers. So effectively now, it's not just us doing HCI but they're also putting it here, which puts a little bit of pressure on the 3-tier storage piece of it. And so we are clearly focused on that opportunity, right, in terms of -- and we've been doing that all day long, right, since we have started migrating legacy 3-tier over to HCI and potentially that this might help. Now the other thing we should have to keep in mind, just so that we don't lose track of it, there are even easier and certain opportunities now because there is a substantial base of vSphere plus vSAN HCI out there. And so that's almost a like-for-like, right? Those customers have already made the HCI decision, and they might be looking. If they're looking to migrate away from VMware, we pretty much have a like-for-like solution that we can migrate over to. And we are doing -- we're not sitting idle here, right? We are doing a bunch of things to capitalize on the opportunity. I'd say 3 things that we're doing. First is that we have been targeting some more advertising dollars to maximize the awareness of Nutanix as the simplest, easiest viable alternative for these customers. Number two, we've also put in place incentives for our partners who are helping customers get to our platform for new customers. As partners bring new customers to us, we give them more incentives. Number three, yes, we are also helping end customers with migration. When they have a VMware environment and they're looking to bring our environment on, there's a period of time where they might have dual operating costs and we try to help them out on that front. So we're also taking some very specific steps to go after the opportunity."", 'Jason Noah Ader', ""Great. And then one quick follow-up just on your comments on Cisco that you're happy with the early progress. When do you think, Rajiv, that could start to really be a material contributor to the business?"", 'Rajiv Ramaswami', ""Yes. We factored in a modest contribution this year, Jason, from Cisco. I do expect that the contribution is going to be more significant in FY '25. And we'll cover that when we get to -- when we already talk about that FY '25 guide. But clearly, it takes time to build this up. We focused on enabling the full solution, training that sellers. And we're happy with the progress we're making. We are getting new customers through the cloud now and they are motivated. So I think over time, it will build."", 'Operator', 'And our next question will come from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.', 'Wamsi Mohan', ""You've got very strong operating leverage in the quarter. Can you talk about if there were any onetime things in there? I think, Rukmini, you mentioned something around hiring. I didn't fully catch. But was there any onetime things in there? And why is that reverting lower next fiscal quarter? And I have a follow-up."", 'Rukmini Sivaraman', ""Yes. Wamsi, thanks for the question. So the reference I made in terms of our operating margin performance in Q2, which was -- came in strong at 22% and higher than our expectation was one revenue was higher than we expected. And expenses were a bit lower because of timing of hiring and just overall good expense management. And we do expect that expenses will go up in the second half. So if you look at half over half, operating expenses implied in the guide that does go up in the second half, Wamsi, and of course, Q3 compared to Q2. Seasonally, the revenue is lower in Q3 than it is in Q2. So those are some of the things that are factoring into the outlook. But overall, I'd say we have continued to be focused on investing and investing thoughtfully on this growth opportunity that's ahead of us. And so that's the approach we've taken. And overall, we've been pleased to take up our full year outlook on both top and bottom line."", 'Wamsi Mohan', 'Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then, Rajiv, I mean, you made some comments already. But can you perhaps maybe quantitatively talk about the wins that are coming your way because of this M&A and sort of how many points of growth potentially we should be thinking about or how many points of share that you think you could see shift over to Nutanix given this disruption? Or even maybe if you can talk about it in qualitative terms around rate and pace of pipeline build just quarter-over-quarter or over the last few quarters, that would be helpful?', 'Rajiv Ramaswami', ""Yes. Wamsi, first of all, I think it's going to be hard for me to give you some very specific quantitative numbers at this point. But what I'd say is, for sure, right, if you look at our last Investor Day, we talked about our TAM and the SAM as part of that, right? The $60 billion, $70 billion TAM and SAM. And what we really expect is -- I mean, we've always been going and continuing to grow market share and eat into that SAM and what this event creates is an opportunity to speed that up, right? So it's the same -- the TAM and SAM haven't really changed. It's still the same, but now we're able to get after more of it quicker. Now the challenge with quantifying it is that it's very hard to predict, right? I mean it's -- yes, we've got that, how much of this is going to come how quickly and -- and this is what -- it's a little early for us to say something there, right? So we've got -- like I said, we've got customers who want to do something different, but they've got these 3, 5-year ELAs. They're not in a rush. There's some time it takes to convert customers and they have to depreciate the hardware that they bought, for example, and then the -- bring us in for a small portion and expand. So all of these things create some unpredictability in terms of timing and how quickly can we capture it. But I certainly think that this provides us an opportunity for us to capture more of that market quicker, and we are trying to move as quickly as we can. I don't know, Rukmini, do you want to provide any color on the pipeline?"", 'Rukmini Sivaraman', ""Yes. I may add one thing to that, Rajiv, which is that I think, Wamsi, your question is specifically around what we can tell about this opportunity as a result of VMware's acquisition by Broadcom. And I'd say, I think the other nuance here is we've always competed against VMware, right? And so in some cases, it's quite clear to tell, well, this door wasn't open to us before. And now it is because of what they may be seeing from our competitor. But in other cases, and we talked about an example on the last earnings call where existing customers of ours are maybe choosing to invest more in us or go single source with us are partly influenced by this, right? So there's this idea of, in some cases, it's clear in other cases, it's more of a factor, an important factor, but one factor. And so in that -- those situations is harder for us to attribute, specifically dollars and pipeline and things like that to this particular disruption in the competitive market. So all those factors combined are -- or what makes us feel good that this is a multiyear opportunity, as Rajiv has mentioned, but difficult to get precise in terms of magnitude and timing."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Pinjalim Bora from JPMorgan.', 'Pinjalim Bora', 'Congrats on the quarter. Rajiv, one of your partners compared the Nutanix Cisco relationship and the buzz around it to the formative years of VCE and noted how VCE was kind of a game changer for VMware at the time. Do you think the Cisco partnership could be that pivotal for Nutanix? And secondly, do you think there are any learnings from the rise and fall of VCE that you can apply, I guess, to this relationship?', 'Rajiv Ramaswami', ""Yes. I was actually there at Cisco at that time with the VCE partnership and clearly very cyclical initially. Now I -- it's hard for me to compare VCE back then converged infrastructure with this. But I'll tell you the -- I'll give you sort of the puts and takes, right? So clearly, Cisco has huge market leverage and market position, right, in terms of their sellers and their access to big accounts and their presence in all these accounts. Now if you look at this particular space in the market, their several position is not that -- they're a small -- relatively small market share player when it comes to servers compared to some of their other competitors. So it's -- so they're not as strong in this segment of the market. However, I mean, they certainly have a big overall market cloud. So now what would the 2 of us do together really to go into the market and that's really, I think, where I do see significant potential here over time. Again, it has to take time to build up. And Cisco also has a complex selling motion. They have generalists, they have specialists. And right now, we are more focused on the data center specialists that they have and working together with them. So to answer your question, I mean, it's a little early days for us to predict how big this could be for us. And I would say we -- I am optimistic, and I think this opportunity is also going to build up over time. And certainly, continuing to -- and in fact, there's a lot of cooperation happening between our sellers and Cisco sellers in the field. So all good omens at this point in time, but still very early."", 'Pinjalim Bora', ""Understood. I guess we'll stay tuned. One question for you, Rukmini. The ACV billings guidance for fiscal Q3. It seems like calls for maybe a little bit higher sequential drawdown. I want to ask you the sales cycle elongation comment that you made, was that versus Q1 -- the elongation in Q2 that you saw, was that sequential? And are you assuming kind of a similar sequential higher elongation in the Q3 guide as well?"", 'Rukmini Sivaraman', ""Pinjalim, thank you for that question. So on -- I think the first part of your question was on seasonality between Q2 and Q3. And so on that front, if you look back to sort of our initial guidance that we gave for Q3 last year this time, Pinjalim, it was actually quite similar in terms of the -- what we guided for Q3 versus Q2. But we were able to beat Q3. And so actually, I think is what you're referring to with smaller than what we guided to. But the decrease, I would say, is more or less in line with what we'd expect for seasonality and what we expected at this time last year as well. And then to your point on the average sales cycle and the modest elongation we're seeing there, it moves around a bit quarter-to-quarter, Pinjalim. But what I was referring to is that when we look back to historical levels, it remains somewhat elevated. And so that's what I was referring to."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of George Wang from Barclays.', 'Dong Wang', 'Congrats on the quarter and the guidance. I have two quick ones. Firstly, you briefly touched on the potential the discounts and promotions to promote VMware customers. And I just want to kind of see if you can elaborate on the approach for the Cisco partnership, the HyperFlex customers? Maybe you can give some color just on the incentives you guys are providing to kind of further drive the adoption from the older HyperFlex customers?', 'Rajiv Ramaswami', ""Yes. We have -- I think I would say that's Cisco, right? With Cisco, clearly, we have a -- they are -- they've ended up like HyperFlex, first of all, and there's a limited time where -- so they're no longer selling the product, and there's a limited support window for it. So that by itself, by the way, it creates an incentive for HyperFlex customers to migrate. And we, through Cisco, of course, has a whole -- Cisco has a set of programs for migration and they're good at driving those types of migration initiatives, and we are supporting them as they do that. So this is being done largely through Cisco and through the Cisco router market."", 'Dong Wang', ""Also, Rajiv, quickly, you talked about the repatriation in the prepared remarks. I'm just curious, are you seeing a more visible inflection point in terms of the repatriation to the private cloud? Or it's still a continuation of prior trend? Just besides lower TCO kind of versus expensive public cloud, can you kind of talk about other factors may contribute to continued repatriation to the private cloud?"", 'Rajiv Ramaswami', ""Yes. I'll give you a two-part answer to that, George. So I don't know if I can call it a point of inflection. But certainly, we are seeing more examples of people repatriating, but those are examples. It's hard for me to say that there's a whole trend here, right? Yet. But some are certainly repatriating, like the example I talked about. But also, I think the other thing that we should keep in mind is that the bulk of enterprise workloads are still not in the public cloud. They're still sitting in data centers. I'm talking about enterprise workloads because what has gone to the public cloud largely have been net new applications. So for these workloads that are still sitting in the enterprise environment, I think CIOs are being a lot more careful about how much of that do they take to the public cloud. So there's -- yes, there's some repatriation happening from the public cloud back on-prem, but there's also a lot more scrutiny and forethought being applied to what should I take going forward into the public cloud from where I'm at."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Michael Cikos from Needham.', 'Michael Joseph Cikos', ""And I wanted to echo my comments as well in addition to the others as far as the great quarter and the results here. I think there's a bit of a two part here. But the first, I know coming back to the financials specifically Rukmini, can you help us think about the benefit to the quarter from the co-terming that occurred? And if -- I guess, to what degree anything was pulled forward that was expected to land later this year when we think about the magnitude of the beat and raise for guidance?"", 'Rukmini Sivaraman', ""Sure. Mike, so yes, I talked about renewals outperformance in Q2, and there were 3 factors that I highlighted to -- as the reason for that outperformance. One was better renewals economics. And by that, I mean, just -- our team is able to get better sort of pricing at the time of renewal, which is good. Secondly, we talked about better on-time renewal performance, which was strong in the quarter as well. And then the third piece, I think, is what you're referring to, Mike, which is around I said that we did -- do a little better on early and co-term renewal. And those, as we've said before, we go out to our customers well in advance of a renewal being due and start that conversation early and that's what they prefer as well. And often, we will be able to transact those renewals earlier than when they are -- in an earlier quarter than when they are due. And co-term similarly. Co-terms are beneficial both for us and for the customer because it then brings a lot of their licenses that may have been purchased at different times to all be aligned to the same end date. And so those we generally welcome as long as they are coming at good economics for us. It's good for the customers. They give us cash upfront. And so those are all generally things that we welcome. Now in terms of the dynamic of the pull forward, which I think was another sort of aspect of your question, Mike, I'd say there is normal variation, right, between quarters, and we would expect that to continue going forward. And I would say, I think we had also talked about this dynamic between fiscal year '24 and fiscal year '25. And I'm not sure if that's where you were going, Mike. But at this point, we still do see that renewal available to renew for next year. The growth in that is accelerating compared to what we saw for fiscal year '24 because that was partly early than co-terms, but was also just a bigger renewal cohort that is coming up in '25, which is leading to that accelerated renewals ATR in '25 compared to '24.So overall, again, I would say a pretty strong quarter from a renewals perspective. And generally, these are all the outperformance is done by things that we like to see. So nothing that I would sort of characterize as better than expected certainly, but allows us to sort of certainly manage the business on a more predictable basis going forward."", 'Michael Joseph Cikos', ""Got it. Got it. And Mike, it's funny you're ending that response on predictability. I think one of the things that I've been going through on my side, this earnings season is certain companies have cited seeing larger deals in their pipeline and greater variability based on when those deals close. So I wanted to get a sense if possible, but can you help us think about the magnitude when you're citing these larger deals? Like are they coming with like an x percent increase in size from a dollar perspective versus what you're historically seeing? And just to help us get a better sense of that. And then the second piece tied to that is, how do you get confidence in driving those deals, again, just because they are obviously more strategic? There's less certainty around the timing of the windows closed. Just anything there as far as how you do gain confidence on that front. It's a high-quality problem I have I'll start with that, but I just want to make sure that you guys are thinking about this and wanted to see how you'd respond to that on our side."", 'Rukmini Sivaraman', ""Yes, it's a good question, Mike, and you're right, these larger deals are inherently more unpredictable, which is why I think my point on your previous question, right, was renewals generally more predictable, although, of course, we think there is some variability there. But definitely more predictable, right, than the new and expansion portion. And so I won't give you a specific number, Mike. I know you were looking for like some percentage or size or something like that. What I would say is when we look at our pipeline of opportunities, and we look at the mix of that, meaning how much is coming from deals of a certain size versus a larger size. And if you think you may have buckets of deal sizes, what we're seeing in the data is that a larger proportion is coming from those higher larger deal size buckets than we've seen previously, right? So -- and that's in addition to the pipeline growing. We're just saying that the mix of it is also changing to be weighted more towards larger deals. So that's sort of the first part of the answer to your question. Now in terms of just how do we get comfortable? We look at what's in the pipeline. We're looking at a lot of other things that we -- in terms of conversion rates and things like that and it's related to the pipeline. And then we put a probability on how many of those we think we can convert, right, during a period of time. And so that's sort of a little more color into the methodology of how we're approaching this, and all that is factored into the guidance that we provided, right? But Rajiv, did you want to add anything to that?"", 'Rajiv Ramaswami', ""Yes, just a couple of things. First of all, I think one of the reasons we're seeing these large deals is because we, of course, for a while, we've been working on a portfolio that -- product portfolio which we think is ready for large-scale enterprise deployments. And so we have segmented our focus a bit further up the market in terms of our own sales force segmentation. And then on top of that, we've got this industry disruption with VMware, where many large customers, of course, who are not necessarily engaged with us before are now engaging with us. So that's the reason for why we're seeing more of these large deals in our pipeline. Now I think with respect to prosecuting these deals, I would say we keep getting better at going after these deals. I mean we have a whole 360 approach towards going after this. We have executive responses on the big accounts where we have large deals. We have a full team assembled to go pursue these deals. And now having said that, so it's still going to be timing, it's going to be a bit unpredictable and the size of these things also tend to vary over time. So it doesn't completely replace the unpredictability, but it does -- it's a series of engagement, right, when you have these types of deals between both companies. We are investing resources, customers are investing a lot of resources as well because there's a lot of testing, certifications, going through contract negotiations, security audits, a whole bunch of things that get through this process. And so I would say we, as a company, are getting better and better at going after these types of opportunities."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley.', 'Meta A. Marshall', ""A couple of questions for me. Maybe just on -- you noted clearly some macro headwinds still. Just wanted to get a sense of any of the shape of that? Or is it still things that are just elongating lead times? Are you seeing it on larger deals, smaller deals, certain verticals, certain types of projects, kind of just any change in color from the past couple of quarters, if there are any? And then maybe on the second question, I would imagine you guys are getting a number of resumes in your inbox right now, just kind of given the disruption. Just any notable hires or how you're finding kind of the pool of talent to add in terms of some of your OpEx adds?"", 'Rajiv Ramaswami', ""Yes. Rukmini, why don't you take number one, I'll take the number two question."", 'Rukmini Sivaraman', ""Yes. Sure, Rajiv. So on macro, Meta, which I think was your first question, it's more or less remained stable relative to what we've seen in the last few quarters. So fairly consistent, okay, with what we've seen in the last few quarters. And I'd -- we'd characterize that as somewhat uncertain, but stable. And that's sort of what we continue to see. So no significant change from that, which, again, as we talked about, did show up in the continued modest elongation of sales cycles compared to our historical levels. Now some of that could also be driven by this larger mix of higher -- larger deal sizes in our pipeline. So that's sort of showing up now. But again, that is also a factor of just the fact that we've gone up market. It's not necessarily a macro point. So on macro, nothing else I would call out in terms of specific verticals seeing strength or weakness that we're noticing at this point. Somewhat uncertain, but stable is how we'd characterize it."", 'Rajiv Ramaswami', ""Yes. And Meta, on the talent question, there's no doubt this is -- 2 years ago, it was a difficult market for talent, right? Everybody was hiring and it was a tough market as we tend to hire the top of the pyramid in terms of software developers. Now that has changed quite significantly for us, right? In this market, today, we are able to attract the best talent from every place, not just VMware or other places you might think of, but also from hyperscalers, for example. And so we see a good tenant environment. We have been using that, of course -- we have been hiring carefully, but selectively in both R&D and sales. And we are seeing really good talent come in the door. And overall, it's helping up level the talent that we have in the company, and I'm very happy about that. And that's happening at the individual contributor levels, but also at the management levels as well, so across the board."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Erik Suppiger from JMP.', 'Erik Loren Suppiger', 'All right. Sorry about that. I wanted to just touch on the subject of larger deals and elongated sales cycles. As previously noted, there have been other vendors that have seen similar trends and there was some discussions around consolidation customers that are getting more focused on consolidating onto a single or a few vendors as opposed to a lot of tools out there. Is that one of the things that could be contributing to the elongated sales cycle? Or is it more of an economic uncertainty issue?', 'Rajiv Ramaswami', ""I'm not sure as much, Erik, whether it's because people are consolidating vendors. In our case, for example, certainly, there's a lot of like, okay, I've got an incumbent vendor that I need to rethink my strategy and bring on alternative vendor. And that's really playing very much for us, right, very much in play. So they were happy with the vendor prior, and now they don't feel happy. So they've got to look at an alternative and we have a very solid infrastructure alternative. That's one factor that's clearly playing. The second factor, as I mentioned a little earlier, is that we as a company have gotten to a point where we have a portfolio that can address pretty much across the enterprise, all the applications that customers are running. So all applications that -- from small scale to very large scale, and that makes us a bigger player in our customers' minds, right? It's not that they're thinking about it as vendor for just one use case anymore. They're thinking about it as a platform vendor for them that can run all their applications. And so that's typically a -- leads to a more larger strategic engagement with the customer, which also takes longer, right? So that, I think, is what's playing in our -- for us -- playing out for us now."", 'Erik Loren Suppiger', 'Okay. Very good. And then just on the ChatGPT-in-a-Box. Just curious if you have seen particular groups or segments of your customer base that are adopting that? Who is doing AI in a private cloud these days?', 'Rajiv Ramaswami', ""Yes. First of all, I'd say it's early days for us, Erik, on that. But we are seeing traction across all kinds of verticals, financial services, defense, federal. In fact, one of our first wins was with the federal agency. Manufacturing, pharma or medical devices. So there's just many different verticals, but the use cases tend to be somewhat similar. Document summarization, search analytics, co-piloting, customer service, right, enhanced fraud detection, these are some of the same -- or same use cases, but across a range of verticals."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research Company.', 'Benjamin James Bollin', ""Rukmini, you made a comment about investing carefully for the growth in front of you. And there's been a few questions on hiring. I'm curious about how your hiring plans have evolved since the start of the year when you look at what you see out there? And in particular, how you're managing the amount of inbound activity that you are seeing from partners and customers? And then I had a follow-up."", 'Rajiv Ramaswami', ""So maybe I'll take that, Ben. So I think there's a couple of points. One is related to hiring. The other is inbound activity from partners, customers, et cetera. So a slightly different question there. So I think -- on the hiring, we've -- if you look at our history here, we've been very, very tight on OpEx for the past few years for the right reasons. As we consolidated our portfolio, got some more focus into the company and got our execution going. And now this is the year where we are investing. Our OpEx is going based on what we've talked about. And -- but we are investing judiciously, continuing to drive both growth and leverage to our bottom line, but we're certainly investing. We're investing in terms of building out our portfolio on an R&D perspective. We're investing in terms of our go-to-market so that we can be more effective in terms of getting -- handling the demand that we're starting to see. And to your point, over the last, I would say, 1 year or 2 years, we've seen more incoming from customers, partners and managed service providers. And we are -- we now have focused efforts in terms of addressing all of those, right, whether it be a larger set of customer engagements, whether it be more focused in terms of the partners, which was one of the priorities that I said very early on when we started here 3 years ago. So more focus on the channel, enabling them, recruiting partners, giving them incentives, making them more autonomous and extending that to our managed service provider partners, where we continue to add more of them to our partner network over time."", 'Benjamin James Bollin', ""Okay. That's great. Rajiv, one other question for you is, you commented earlier about some CIO scrutiny as it relates to the data center investments and public cloud investments. I'm curious if you're seeing any change in how customers are thinking about their longer-term infrastructure planning from an investment perspective notably because of what's happened with Broadcom and VMware? And that's it for me."", 'Rajiv Ramaswami', ""Well, I mean, certainly, Ben. So the bottom line, I think, absolutely it is, right? I mean, again, VMware was a great technology vendor with a lot of innovation and customers and with a large footprint at customers. And now they have to rethink whether that's the right long-term strategy for them. And so that says, okay, well, we've got to either look at alternative providers, of which we are an easy alternative or they could say, when I could go more to the public cloud, okay, which is not as easy a thing for existing workloads to just take everything and move it to the public cloud, that's not easy to do. And then they factor into the fact -- cost, regulatory aspects of it and so forth. So clearly, I think for us as a vendor, there is certainly -- we see customers continue to invest in infrastructure modernization in terms of digitization, in terms of running modern applications not just in the public cloud but also on-prem. And like some of these new cycles that are happening now, like AI, for example, we'll also find the spot down the same route, right, which is -- it's starting out with a lot of training happening in public cloud, but it's moving towards, okay, I'm going to run my AI, I'm going to -- I'm going to fine-tune the training on my own data sets, which are proprietary that I want to keep carefully. And I'm going to have to potentially look at slightly different solutions for inferencing which are going to be running closer to my edge locations. So these things are driving what we call hybrid multi-cloud. And I think that's very much, I think, the world that many of our customers are here for the next several years."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Dan Bergstrom from RBC Capital Markets.', 'Daniel Robert Bergstrom', ""It's Dan Bergstrom for Matt Hedberg. To build off a recent answer that mentioned a 360 approach around VMware deals, could you go into some of the mechanics and processes involved in migration over from VMware? I guess, specifically what tools are in place to facilitate migrations? And then how long does a typical migration take?"", 'Rajiv Ramaswami', ""Yes. I mean -- and the answer to that query -- but I'll go through the process, Dan. So there's clearly an assessment of what the workloads are that our applications are that are running on that infrastructure. That's one part of it and making sure that we can run all those workloads with good performance, which, by and large, is the case these days. The second is what elements of the stack have they deployed? And the more of the elements that they have deployed, the stickier or the more complex migration becomes. So for example, for a customer that just only deployed a hypervisor, it's a largely automated move away from the hypervisor to our hypervisor. We have automated tools. In fact, our tools called Move. We've done a lot of these VM migrations all day long. And so that's a relatively simple migration that can be done automated. Now at the other end of the spectrum, if they've invested a lot of custom automation work, custom security work on top of the stack, then some of those will have to be converted over and that requires a professional services engagement, which also is part of our offering to help convert over some of those onto our platform or onto more open types of platforms. For example, automation people are looking at Terraform as an example. So in those cases, it's a more complex migration. I'll give you some examples though. In a lot of cases, actually, what happens is that the migration plan will take some time, the actual execution of the migration is very quick. There was a case study that we published recently of a health care system that we've been engaged with for the past 3 years or so. The name of pediatrics, it's public at this point. And they planned this migration for a few years. But when they actually came around to doing the migration, they were done within 90 days. So that's a typical example. There's a cycle of selling and engagement and everything and then getting everything ready. And then once it's ready, they were able to migrate in 90 days, and I would call them as a medium complexity environment. They're not at the high end of the complexity, but they're not necessarily the lower -- the simplest side."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James.', 'W. Chiu', ""This is Victor Chiu for Simon Leopold. Just really quickly, can you help us understand what's baked into your full year outlook specifically? Does the current guidance reflects gains from VMware at a similar rate? Or are you expecting this accelerates from here?"", 'Rukmini Sivaraman', ""Thank you, Victor, for the question. So the full year guide assumes some benefit from the VMware being acquired by Broadcom, as we said at the beginning of the year. And no, it does not expect any acceleration at this point, right? It just assumes it has some benefit in there. It also assumes a small benefit, as we've talked about before, towards the end of the year from the Cisco partnership as well. But that, again, as Rajiv said, we expect that to grow over time and certainly into fiscal year '25, but there's a small benefit from that baked in as well in addition to sort of all the other dynamics we've talked about on this call, right, including modest elongation, average sales cycles, unpredictability with regard to large deals in the pipeline, et cetera."", 'W. Chiu', ""Okay. Great. That's helpful. And just lastly, I wanted to follow up on the macro question. We've been hearing through the channel that the sentiment on the HCI market overall has turned slightly more cautious. Can you help us understand what you're thinking for HCI growth overall this year and how Nutanix performs relative to that?"", 'Rajiv Ramaswami', ""Yes. Maybe I'll take that. I don't think -- we haven't seen a slowdown or caution around HCI adoption. I think it's been the same kind of dynamic that we've seen in the past, right? There is a legacy infrastructure out there. The HCI capabilities have continuously gotten better over time where HCI today can run pretty much all enterprise workloads on the platform and in many cases, can do so with better performance even than legacy architecture.So better performance, better TCO or much simpler to operate. So -- but I think the -- what we've always had to overcome is inertia, right? We've got a set way of doing things that customers have been doing for a long time. And here is a shift to a more modern software-defined architecture. And that shift we have to do, right? And we have to overcome that with all that. And -- but that's been what we've been doing for the entire existence of the company. So I wouldn't see that there's been a bunch of change in how our customers are thinking about it, certainly not in the last year or so that I've seen."", 'W. Chiu', ""That's great. And how the growth -- what you're thinking for growth and kind of how Nutanix is growing relative?"", 'Rajiv Ramaswami', ""Yes. I think we -- I don't have much to add beyond what we covered at Investor Day just last September, where we provided both the TAM and SAM opportunities and our growth outlook in terms of -- 20% ARR growth in terms of what we could drive through FY '27 is what we said there."", 'Operator', ""And with that, this will conclude our question-and-answer session today. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.""]"
