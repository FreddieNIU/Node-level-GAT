1,0e1fc54d-8505-38dc-934b-b51bdabeb91d,CTAS,2023-10-08,18% Of This Cintas Insider's Holdings Were Sold,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/18-cintas-insiders-holdings-were-120026851.html,1696680026,STORY,['CTAS'],"[Viewing insider transactions for Cintas Corporation's (NASDAQ:CTAS ) over the last year, we see that insiders were net sellers. This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Cintas Cintas Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Michael Thompson, for US$6.6m worth of shares, at about US$445 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$493, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 18% of Michael Thompson's holding. Michael Thompson was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of CintasLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Cintas insiders own about US$7.5b worth of shares (which is 15% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Cintas Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Cintas insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Cintas insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Cintas. While conducting our analysis, we found that Cintas has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore this.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

But all eyes are on Iran, a major oil producer and key backer of the Hamas group that launched this weekend’s offensive on Israel.A retaliatory strike against the Islamic Republic would inflame fears over the Strait of Hormuz, the vital shipping artery which Tehran has previously threatened to close. There’s also the prospect of the US cracking down again on a resurgent flow of Iranian oil exports.“Iran remains a very big wild card,” said Helima Croft, chief commodities strategist at RBC Capital Markets and a former CIA analyst. “Israel will escalate its long-running shadow war against Iran” and “what is unpredictable is how Iran would respond to such an intensification.”The risk of a wider conflict has emerged just as global crude supplies have been depleted by months of sharp production cutbacks by Saudi Arabia and Russia. Last month their supply constraints briefly pushed Brent futures to almost $100 a barrel.“It is unlikely to impact oil supply in the short term,” said hedge fund trader Pierre Andurand, founder of Andurand Capital Management LLP. “But it could eventually have an impact on supply and prices.”The onslaught comes almost exactly 50 years after the Arab oil embargo, when Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers choked off flows to the west in the wake of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, which also involved Israel.READ: For Oil, It’s Not 1973. But It Could Still Get Ugly: Javier BlasStory continuesNo one expects Riyadh — which has been negotiating with Washington over normalizing relations with Israel — to turn off the taps in solidarity with the Palestinians now. At worst, the conflict may derail the normalization talks and scupper any additional Saudi oil flows that may have resulted.The energy minister of the United Arab Emirates, a key OPEC member, was clear on Sunday that the conflict wouldn’t affect the group’s decision-making.“We do not engage in politics; we govern by supply and demand, and we do not consider what each country has done,” Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei told reporters in Riyadh.For its part, Iran, also an OPEC member, has expressed support for the Palestinian attack.Israel Latest: Fighting Extends to Second Day, Stocks PlungeIf Israel responds by striking any Iranian infrastructure, “crude prices would immediately spike on the perceived risk of a disruption,” said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group and a former White House official. For now, that looks unlikely, he said.Iranian oil has become increasingly important to the market as shipments have rebounded to a five-year high. That has come with Washington’s tacit blessing as the two sides have engaged in tentative diplomacy to re-establish limits on Tehran’s nuclear program.This weekend’s hostilities could prompt President Joe Biden’s administration to deal more aggressively with those cargo flows, which mostly go to China.“I think this development will mean stronger enforcement of Iranian sanctions, so less Iranian oil going forward,” said Andurand. “And then who knows what the domino effect will be in the region?”In a more extreme scenario, Iran could respond to any direct provocation by blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a nautical choke-point just north of the Arabian Sea.Tankers haul nearly 17 million barrels of crude and condensate each day through the waterway, which at its narrowest point is just 21 miles wide. Tehran threatened to close the strait when sanctions were imposed on the country in 2011, but ultimately backed off.The swelling tide of Iranian barrels has helped to moderate fuel prices this year while the Saudis and Vladimir Putin’s Russia squeeze supplies. The joint Riyadh-Moscow action is draining oil inventories at the fastest pace in years, installing a hefty price premium on prompt supplies known in the industry as backwardation.The “crude market is very tight” as “physical markets are screaming, with backwardation heading higher, dragging the flat price higher,”said Gary Ross, a veteran oil consultant turned hedge fund manager at Black Gold Investors LLC.Last week brought signs that the push toward $100 had gone too far, as Brent slumped 11% to just under $85 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. Production cuts by the Saudis and Russia may have juiced prices too high, exacerbating jitters over the economy and bolstering the risk of higher interest rates.On the other hand, slashing output to about 9 million barrels a day has given Riyadh an immense buffer of spare production capacity that could be deployed if the current crisis leads to a disruption. The kingdom has about 3 million barrels day in reserve, and neighboring United Arab Emirates has another 1 million, according to Bloomberg estimates.That prodigious safety cushion of idle capacity is another reason traders don’t expect an immediate price surge when markets reopen. Still, the events may restore some of the geopolitical risk premium that had melted away in recent years.“The Hamas strike and Israeli response raises the geopolitical temperature,” said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd.--With assistance from Fahad Abuljadayel, Salma El Wardany and Anthony Di Paola.(Updates headline.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Free-Money Experiment Is OverCan AI Beat the Market?

(NASDAQ:ALGN)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-align-technology-130043448.html,1696683643,STORY,['ALGN'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Align Technology is US$264 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$285 suggests Align Technology is potentially trading close to its fair value Analyst price target for ALGN is US$391, which is 48% above our fair value estimateDoes the October share price for Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Align Technology The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$673.8mUS$769.7mUS$774.1mUS$877.1mUS$931.6mUS$978.1mUS$1.02bUS$1.05bUS$1.09bUS$1.12bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 6.21%Est @ 4.99%Est @ 4.14%Est @ 3.54%Est @ 3.12%Est @ 2.83% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$632US$678US$640US$680US$678US$668US$653US$635US$614US$593(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.5bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.1b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.2%) = US$26bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$26b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$14bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$20b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$285, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Align Technology as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.881. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Align TechnologyStrengthCurrently debt free.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) shareholders have seen the share price rise 53% over three years, well in excess of the market return (15%, not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 0.6% in the last year , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for General Dynamics While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.General Dynamics was able to grow its EPS at 2.9% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 15% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of General Dynamics' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of General Dynamics, it has a TSR of 64% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned.

But that was short of the market average. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 5% per year for five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term.

But all eyes are on Iran, a major oil producer and key backer of the Hamas group that launched this weekend’s offensive on Israel.A retaliatory strike against the Islamic Republic would inflame fears over the Strait of Hormuz, the vital shipping artery which Tehran has previously threatened to close. There’s also the prospect of the US cracking down again on a resurgent flow of Iranian oil exports.“Iran remains a very big wild card,” said Helima Croft, chief commodities strategist at RBC Capital Markets and a former CIA analyst. “Israel will escalate its long-running shadow war against Iran” and “what is unpredictable is how Iran would respond to such an intensification.”The risk of a wider conflict has emerged just as global crude supplies have been depleted by months of sharp production cutbacks by Saudi Arabia and Russia. Last month their supply constraints briefly pushed Brent futures to almost $100 a barrel.“It is unlikely to impact oil supply in the short term,” said hedge fund trader Pierre Andurand, founder of Andurand Capital Management LLP. “But it could eventually have an impact on supply and prices.”The onslaught comes almost exactly 50 years after the Arab oil embargo, when Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers choked off flows to the west in the wake of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, which also involved Israel.READ: For Oil, It’s Not 1973. But It Could Still Get Ugly: Javier BlasStory continuesNo one expects Riyadh — which has been negotiating with Washington over normalizing relations with Israel — to turn off the taps in solidarity with the Palestinians now. At worst, the conflict may derail the normalization talks and scupper any additional Saudi oil flows that may have resulted.The energy minister of the United Arab Emirates, a key OPEC member, was clear on Sunday that the conflict wouldn’t affect the group’s decision-making.“We do not engage in politics; we govern by supply and demand, and we do not consider what each country has done,” Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei told reporters in Riyadh.For its part, Iran, also an OPEC member, has expressed support for the Palestinian attack.Israel Latest: Fighting Extends to Second Day, Stocks PlungeIf Israel responds by striking any Iranian infrastructure, “crude prices would immediately spike on the perceived risk of a disruption,” said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group and a former White House official. For now, that looks unlikely, he said.Iranian oil has become increasingly important to the market as shipments have rebounded to a five-year high. That has come with Washington’s tacit blessing as the two sides have engaged in tentative diplomacy to re-establish limits on Tehran’s nuclear program.This weekend’s hostilities could prompt President Joe Biden’s administration to deal more aggressively with those cargo flows, which mostly go to China.“I think this development will mean stronger enforcement of Iranian sanctions, so less Iranian oil going forward,” said Andurand. “And then who knows what the domino effect will be in the region?”In a more extreme scenario, Iran could respond to any direct provocation by blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a nautical choke-point just north of the Arabian Sea.Tankers haul nearly 17 million barrels of crude and condensate each day through the waterway, which at its narrowest point is just 21 miles wide. Tehran threatened to close the strait when sanctions were imposed on the country in 2011, but ultimately backed off.The swelling tide of Iranian barrels has helped to moderate fuel prices this year while the Saudis and Vladimir Putin’s Russia squeeze supplies. The joint Riyadh-Moscow action is draining oil inventories at the fastest pace in years, installing a hefty price premium on prompt supplies known in the industry as backwardation.The “crude market is very tight” as “physical markets are screaming, with backwardation heading higher, dragging the flat price higher,”said Gary Ross, a veteran oil consultant turned hedge fund manager at Black Gold Investors LLC.Last week brought signs that the push toward $100 had gone too far, as Brent slumped 11% to just under $85 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. Production cuts by the Saudis and Russia may have juiced prices too high, exacerbating jitters over the economy and bolstering the risk of higher interest rates.On the other hand, slashing output to about 9 million barrels a day has given Riyadh an immense buffer of spare production capacity that could be deployed if the current crisis leads to a disruption. The kingdom has about 3 million barrels day in reserve, and neighboring United Arab Emirates has another 1 million, according to Bloomberg estimates.That prodigious safety cushion of idle capacity is another reason traders don’t expect an immediate price surge when markets reopen. Still, the events may restore some of the geopolitical risk premium that had melted away in recent years.“The Hamas strike and Israeli response raises the geopolitical temperature,” said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd.--With assistance from Fahad Abuljadayel, Salma El Wardany and Anthony Di Paola.(Updates headline.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Free-Money Experiment Is OverCan AI Beat the Market?

19,81452417-19ac-34ca-9b49-8aaa3767c0ad,NOV,2023-10-08,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-044132216.html,1696740092,STORY,"['NG=F', 'GC=F']","[Investing.com -- The economy and geopolitics basically rule supply and demand of commodities. The economy dictates demand more than supply. Geopolitics, conversely, controls supply rather than demand. If what transpired in the just-ended week was economic worry depressing the price of oil, then you’re likely to get some of the opposite this week: geopolitics, in the form of the Israel-Hamas war, driving crude prices up.How much higher? That’s something even the Saudis probably can’t answer at this moment.Oil prices fell between 9% and 11% last week, depending whether it's US crude or Brent you’re looking at. It was the biggest weekly slump since March and was deeper than any weekly rally over the past three months. It came as US Treasury yields at 16-year highs and a dollar at a 10-month peak pressured other currencies and economies while consumption of gasoline — the No. 1 fuel product in the United States — was at a seasonal low of 25 years.The week we are entering is quite a different one. Even without the Israel-Hamas war, the dollar could be one reason for recovery in commodities denominated in the currency, including oil. After reaching its highest level since November on Tuesday, the dollar slid for the remaining three days of last week.Sunil Kumar Dixit, a technical chartist for markets and regular collaborator with Investing.com, sees profit-taking in the coming week weighing further on theDollar Index, which pits the US currency against six other majors, namely the euro, yen, pound, Swiss franc, Swedish krona and Canadian dollar.“The Dollar Index faced strong resistance at that 107.35 high and has started declining, with the 3 Black Crows formation on its daily chart,” said Dixit. “Immediate support is seen at 105.78 which is likely to be breached eventually, exposing 23.6% fibonacci retracement zone 105.52. The path of resistance is likely to shift to 106.50 -106.60.”“Subsequent weakness below 105.50 will extend decline to 104.70 and 104.35 followed by major support at 103.50 which aligns with 100-day SMA, or Simple Moving Average, as well as the 50% Fibonacci zone.”Story continuesThat’s for the dollar. Now for the Israel-Hamas conflict, which threatens to redraw power stakes in the Middle East more forcefully than any singular event of the past 30 years.As aforementioned, how deep an impact it would have on oil prices is not known. But with the showdown itself being in the super-sensitive zone which is central to oil production, an intelligent guess is that prices would be higher in the immediate days as the trade tries to figure out if supply would indeed be affected and to what extent.In that analysis, all attention would be on Iran, which is tacitly behind Hamas at all times.Despite its weakened finances in recent years due to US sanctions, Iran remains the Middle East’s third largest economy, after Turkey and Saudi Arabia. More importantly, it is the world’s fifth largest oil producer.With the Israelis vowing commensurate response for one of the worst attacks ever on their soil, a counter engagement against Tehran, either unilaterally by Jerusalem, or with the combined might of the United States, could have ramifications for the oil trade.As Bloomberg’s oil columnist, Javier Blas, pointed out in the immediate hours after the Hamas attack, the most immediate impact could come if Israel concludes that Hamas acted on the instructions of Tehran. He referenced the 2019 attack on Saudi facilities, where a chunk of the country’s oil production capacity was taken out by Yemenis whom many suspect were guided from beginning to end by Iran.“Even if Israel doesn’t immediately respond to Iran, the repercussions will likely affect Iranian oil production,” Blas wrote. “Since late 2022, Washington has turned a blind eye to surging Iranian oil exports, bypassing American sanctions. The priority in Washington was an informal détente with Tehran.”“As a result, Iranian oil output has surged nearly 700,000 barrels a day this year - the second-largest source of incremental supply in 2023, behind only US shale. The White House is now likely to enforce the sanctions.”But Blas also concedes that since Russia will benefit from any Middle East oil crisis, the United States might proceed more carefully with all its options.“If Washington enforces sanctions against Iran, it could create space for Russia’s own sanctioned barrels to both win market share and achieve higher prices. One of the reasons why the White House turned a blind eye on Iranian oil exports is because it hurt Russia.”“In turn, Venezuela could also benefit, with the White House relaxing sanctions to ease market pressure,” Blas added, referring to another country which the United States has complicated ties with, due to oil.Blas also makes another interesting point related to oil supply. The crisis, though coming exactly 50 years after the Arab Oil Embargo, isn’t a repeat of that October 1973 crisis. Arab countries aren't attacking Israel in unison, he points out. This time, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Arab world are watching the events from the sidelines, not shaping them, he notes.“The oil market itself doesn't have any of the pre-October 1973 characteristics,” Blas adds. “Back then, oil demand was surging, and the world had exhausted all its spare production capacity. Today, consumption growth has moderated, and is likely to slow further as electric vehicles become a reality. In addition, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have significant spare capacity that they use to curb prices – if they choose to do so.”To me, the Saudis are another interesting dark horse in this puzzle. In ordinary times, when world oil supply is in a dire shortage, the Saudis will be the ones to rescue it, given their standing as the nation with the highest capacity to produce more.But the Saudis have become the main driver of the supply squeeze in oil now, carrying out some of the deepest production cuts ever in the history of the kingdom, ostensibly to get $100 or more for a barrel. They almost got there two weeks ago, when global crude benchmark Brent went above $97. Thus, the selloff in the just-ended week must have incensed the Saudis to no end and they are hardly likely to add even a barrel after this as relief to any new supply squeeze related to reprisals from this war.Last but not least, President Joe Biden could again turn to the US oil reserve if the supply situation got too tight to the extent that prices shot way above $100, Blas said. Stockpiles in the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve are already at their lowest since the 1980s after the president released some 200 million barrels over the past two years to plug shortages which drove pump prices of gasoline to record highs of $5 last summer. “The reserve still has enough oil to deal with another crisis,” Blas said.In conclusion, I’ll say that geopolitics tends to have an intense and outsized impact on anything, but its effect is also typically shorter and less pronounced than that caused by the economy. That’s why I said at the outset that while this war would most likely push crude prices up in the immediate term, it’s hard to predict how long that would be the case.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for delivery in November posted a final trade of $82.81 a barrel, after officially settling at $82.79, up 48 cents, or 0.6%.That was a rebound from the 8% slump of the past two sessions, although the US crude benchmark did make a fresh five-week low of $81.53 on the day.London-traded Brent for the most-active December contract had a last trade of $84.43, after officially settling at $84.57, up 54 cents, or 0.6%, returning to the green lane after also seeing a drop of some 8% between Wednesday and Thursday.Like WTI, the global crude benchmark printed a five week low in the latest session, falling to $83.50.For the week, the US crude benchmark was down 9% while its UK peer fell 11%. That was the worst week since March for both.Oil: WTI Technical OutlookFollowing the previous week's indecision after resistance at $95, WTI reacted to headwinds that sent it smashing through the 100-week SMA of $86.15 and reached $81.50, in close vicinity to the 50-week EMA, or Exponential Moving Average of $80.90.“Break below this zone may cause some limited consolidation to weekly middle Bollinger Band $79.30,” Dixit said. “We, however, expect resumption of strong demand from the support zone as value buyers await in anticipation of an imminent new leg higher beyond the recent high of $95.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity While futures of gold on New York’s Comex, as well as the spot price of bullion traded globally, were up on the day, on a weekly basis both fell for a third week in a row, responding to the relentless selloff of late in bonds and the rally in the dollar.Gold’s most-active futures contract on New York’s Comex, December, did a final trade of $1,847 an ounce after officially settling Friday's trading at $1845.20, up $13.40, or 0.7%. It hit a seven-month low of $1,823.55 earlier.The spot price of gold, more closely watched by some traders than futures, settled $1,832.59, up $12.33, or 0.7%, on the day. Spot gold hit a 7-month low of $1,810.47 earlier in the day.Gold: Spot Price Outlook Dixit’s outlook: “Gold dropped to $1,810, below the 200 week SMA of $1,815 and triggered retail short covering in the wake of a weekend full of uncertainties. The rebound caused sharp recovery to $1,835 to close at 5 Day EMA of $1,832.“RSI and Stochastics begin to turn north, hinting at strong rebound which immediately targets 4 Hour 50 EMA $1,846 and 100 Week SMA $1,855. Above this zone, the bullish rebound is expected to continue with targets $1,863-$1,869, followed by $1,881. Any correction to $1928-$1820 may be considered a buying opportunity.”“Tensions erupted in the Israel vs Palestine conflict puts a geopolitical crisis on an explosive situation, which is certain to trigger panic demand for safe-haven buying in gold. The rally is likely to reach $1927 in a quick chase.”Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity Things are beginning to look up for the natural gas bull, after months and months of haplessness.America’s favorite fuel for indoor heating and cooling reinforced its hold on $3 pricing on Friday as futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub scored double-digit gains for a second straight week.Turnaround in the prospects of gas, which prior to this was stuck at mid-$2 levels for most of the year, came as weather, demand and production synced in the positive to support higher pricing.Aiding the bull fervor was gas storage data showing a smallish build for last week, contrary to expectations for a larger one, as some lingering warmth before the advent of cooler fall temperatures led to more air-conditioning demand.The most-active November gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub settled Friday’s trade at $3.33 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units, up 17 cents, or 5.4%, on the day. For the week, November gas gained 14%, adding to the prior week’s advance of 11%.This week’s rally in gas accelerated after the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, reported a build of just 86 billion cubic feet, or bcf, in storage of the fuel during the week ended Sept. 29, versus the 92 bcf expected by industry analysts tracked by Investing.com. In the prior week to Sept. 22, storage rose by 90 bcf.Total gas in US storage was at 3.445 trillion cubic feet as of last week, up 11.6% from a year ago, the EIA said. Earlier this year, the storage was more than 20% up year-on-year. On a five-year basis (2018-2022), inventories were just 5.3% higher, down from double-digits earlier this year.Natural gas: Price OutlookDixit’s outlook: “After 33 weeks of consolidation, of which 16 weeks have been spent above the weekly Middle Bollinger Band, natural gas futures finally made a strong breakout above the critical barrier of the 50-week EMA of $3.35. As long as $2.82 holds as support, continuation of the uptrend targets the 200-week SMA statically aligned with $3.77, followed by the next challenge at the psychological handle $4.”Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesExxon investors ready to embrace buying existing oil over new drillingAnalysis-Exxon Mobil's megadeal to test climate-aware shareholders]"

A Look At Its Intrinsic Value",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nextera-energy-inc-nyse-nee-130012430.html,1696683612,STORY,['NEE'],"[Key InsightsUsing the Dividend Discount Model, NextEra Energy fair value estimate is US$41.56Current share price of US$50.24 suggests NextEra Energy is potentially 21% overvalued The US$78.57 analyst price target for NEE is 89% more than our estimate of fair valueHow far off is NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy What's The Estimated Valuation?We have to calculate the value of NextEra Energy slightly differently to other stocks because it is a electric utilities company. Instead of using free cash flows, which are hard to estimate and often not reported by analysts in this industry, dividends per share (DPS) payments are used. Unless a company pays out the majority of its FCF as a dividend, this method will typically underestimate the value of the stock. The 'Gordon Growth Model' is used, which simply assumes that dividend payments will continue to increase at a sustainable growth rate forever. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%. Relative to the current share price of US$50.2, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.Story continuesValue Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)= US$2.1 / (6.2% – 2.2%)= US$41.6dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NextEra Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for NextEra EnergyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electric Utilities market.Shareholders have been diluted in the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

The size of the delivery is enough to fill around 45 Panamax-size vessels.""We think Wilmar has already sold most, or even all, of that volume,"" said the first trader.""And China bought around 1.2 to 1.5 million tonnes.""The second trader estimated Wilmar' sales to China at around 1 million tons.""They sold it cheaper to have a large book,"" he said, indicating the Singapore-based trader will make a profit due to the very large volume.The fresh Chinese buying comes days after the country decided to resume sales of its sugar reserves - the first time it does it since 2016 - as stocks internally were running low and prices were high.Traders and analysts said that a combination of several factors led to the large delivery, including the record Brazilian crop, elevated interest rates and the reduced premium between the October and the March contracts at ICE.Story continues""With current interest rates, carrying sugar nowadays costs a lot of money,"" the second trader said, referring to the costs of storage and hedging.LOGISTICSIt will be a challenging logistic operation for Wilmar and the delivering parties, the traders said, as the rainy season is starting in the South American country and that can delay loading.A total of six commodities traders decided to deliver the sugar, including China's COFCO, Louis Dreyfus Co, Sucden and Viterra.According to ICE rules, deliverers have to bring the sugar to the ports, and the receiver needs to nominate the vessel.The second source said Wilmar has nominated the first six vessels this week. Most of the loading will take place in Santos and Paranagua ports.""This massive delivery shall create huge lineups with big waiting times in Oct-Nov when sugar vessels still compete with the grain exports and are also exposed to eventual delays related to the rainy season,"" said sugar analyst Claudiu Covrig.(Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Marguerita Choy)]"

25,382679f2-d99b-37b0-8eac-20e21c1ae6f6,ROK,2023-10-08,3 Robotics Stocks Set to Explode Higher,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-robotics-stocks-set-explode-190433529.html,1696187073,STORY,"['LAZR', 'ABB.BO', 'ROK']","[The AI boom has been nothing short of remarkable, with companies like OpenAI reaching meteoric valuations almost overnight. But while the hype around generative text models like ChatGPT is red-hot, I believe the stratospheric growth of these large language models is unsustainable. The AI landscape is becoming fiercely competitive, and these text-based AI companies will struggle to keep dazzling Wall Street.That’s why I argue investors should shift their sights to robotics, and companies specifically involved in industrial and warehouse robotics. This area of robotics has far fewer players than conversational AI, giving leading companies huge competitive moats. Additionally, their growth runways are massive, as demand for automation solutions has never been higher.With the labor market still painfully tight, companies are desperate to automate certain roles. With global supply chains in turmoil, warehouses and factories need robots to improve efficiency and resilience. Even consumers are beginning to embrace robots for tasks like cleaning and security.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn other words, while software AI stocks may soon plateau, robotics stocks still have lots of room to run. These companies benefit from searing demand, high barriers to entry, and a blue-collar industry that’s ripe for disruption. Here are the three robotics stocks I’ve got on my watch list now.ABB Ltd (ABBNY)robotic arms over medical bed symbolizing medical roboticsSource: shutterstock.com/MAD.vertiseABB Ltd. (OTCMKTS:ABBNY) is a Switzerland-based industrial automation and robotics leader operating in over 100 countries. Investors often overlook this $65 billion industrial conglomerate. However, ABB is one of the dominant forces in robotics, with over 400,000 industrial robots installed worldwide.In Q2 2023, ABB continued its strong momentum, delivering 13% revenue growth amidst macroeconomic headwinds. This performance was driven by ABB’s leadership in automation solutions for energy infrastructure and data centers, including industrial applications. Crucially, ABB’s profitability improved substantially, with operational EBITA margins expanding 200 basis points to 17.5%, an all-time high.Story continuesFurthermore, ABB sees sustainable tailwinds from energy transition spending, infrastructure investments, and labor shortages necessitating automation. Although some investors worry about a cyclical downturn impacting ABB’s short-cycle businesses, its growth trajectory seems assured by a $21.9 billion order backlog, most of which is linked to resilient automation platforms.With shares trading at a reasonable 19-times earnings and offering a 2.6% dividend yield, ABBNY stock presents an attractive way to gain robotics exposure alongside stability from its diversified industrial portfolio. The company anticipates at least 10% revenue growth and greater than 16% EBITA margins for 2023.Rockwell Automation (ROK)Rockwell Automation sign is seen in Cambridge, On, Canada. ROK stock.Source: JHVEPhoto / ShutterstockIf Swiss diversification doesn’t excite you, then perhaps consider U.S. manufacturing leader Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK). With a market cap of $33 billion, Rockwell is a major player in this space. The company provides automation equipment and services predominantly targeting manufacturing clients, having ridden the capital investment wave in manufacturing over the past few years.In its fiscal Q3 2023, Rockwell delivered 13.7% sales growth and 13% adjusted earnings per share growth year-over-year. Although the company faced component shortages and logistics issues during the quarter, demand for its automation systems remains robust. Rockwell anticipates full-year fiscal 2023 sales growth of 14-16%, with a 25% increase expected in the company’s adjusted earnings.Underpinning this growth is Rockwell’s advance into higher-margin software offerings, including cybersecurity, simulation, and cloud-based manufacturing analytics. The company expects 17% growth in high-margin annual recurring revenue this year. Sure, Rockwell’s backlog metric hasn’t been impressive, but that is normal with improving lead times. Management believes order patterns will normalize due to strong underlying demand persisting from manufacturing and machine builder customers.Finally, ROK stock does trade at a 22-times forward earnings premium, so it’s not cheap. But this valuation is for good reason. Analysts forecast 15% annual earnings growth over the next three years, surpassing other industrial automatons. I believe it can definitely pull off better gains than ABB, but the forward dividend yield here is a little less at 1.7%.Luminar Technologies (LAZR)Luminar (LAZR stock) sign with greenery around itSource: JHVEPhoto/shutterstock.comLooking beyond industrial applications, autonomous vehicles represent an enormous opportunity for robotics technology. That’s where Luminar (NASDAQ:LAZR) comes in.The startup focuses exclusively on lidar sensors and software for self-driving cars. In Q2 2023, Luminar grew revenue by 63% annually, driven by its partnerships with major automakers. The company aims to achieve quarterly breakeven by the end of 2025 due to increasing lidar adoption in consumer vehicles. While still loss-making, Luminar has won over a dozen commercial contracts from automakers planning to launch autonomous functionality powered by its lidar.Luminar expects to grow its forward order book from $3.4 billion presently to over $60 billion by the end the decade. It also made progress on industrialization and software deliverables needed to support commercialization. With the global autonomous vehicle market projected to reach $3.4 trillion by 2032, Luminar has vast room for growth if it can cement itself as the lidar standard.Of course, Luminar faces competition from other lidar players and must convince automakers to incorporate costly lidar sensors more widely. Still, with automakers like Volvo (OTCMKTS:VLVLY) and Polestar (NASDAQ:PSNY) choosing Luminar lidar for their flagship electric SUVs, momentum is building.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

From the regional banking crisis earlier this year to stress in the commercial real estate market, to the threat of a deeper than expected recession, banks have been stuck between a rock and a hard place. While some have benefitted from rising interest rates, most have simply suffered as the macroeconomic backdrop darkened.However it could be time to warm to the sector, with most of the negativity more-or-less priced in. There’s no question banks will have to weather a storm as the cost of living crisis persists, but most investors have made peace with that eventuality. With that in mind, there are some bargains to be had and investors with a long-term horizon have the opportunity to pick up strong names while their valuations are depressed. But there are still some ticking time bombs out there to be mindful of.When it comes to the large cap banks, diversity tends to offer enough insulation. But investors should be mindful of which banks are in a position to weather the storm, and which will be battered and bruised on the other side. The smaller names are much more at risk, so investors need to look for names that have strong balance sheets and steady revenue streams. If they’re heading into the storm with a faulty boat, you can be pretty sure they’ll be worse-off on the other side. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsZions Bancorp (ZION)A photo of a zion bank 24 Hour AtmSource: Michael Gordon/Shutterstock.comZions Bancorp (NASDAQ:ZION) is still trying to shake off the damage from the Silicon Valley Bank (OTCMKTS:SIVBQ) drama earlier this year. Unfortunately, Zion’s performance since the incident hasn’t been enough to calm investors’ liquidity worries still looming large in the background. The group recently revised down its net interest margins expectations, a key profitability measure for banks.Much of that is out of Zions’ control and in the Fed’s hands, though. If interest rates remain high, that will continue to put pressure on the entire sector. But Zions is in a unique position because part of its strategy hinges on upgrading its technology. That means there are very few levers to pull when it comes to cost cutting, which could be a problem if the macroeconomic backdrop worsens in the months ahead. Zions could find itself in a precarious position that some of its healthier peers can avoid.Story continuesFirst Horizon (FHN)bank stocksSource: fizkes / Shutterstock.com2023 went from bad to worse for First Horizon (NYSE:FHN), as bank stocks tumbled thanks to the banking crisis. Then, later when TD Bank (NYSE:TD) left the bank high and dry following an acquisition attempt. This shined a spotlight on the lack of underlying shareholder value that the bank offers.Without the TD merger to get excited about, shareholders had to take a bleak look at what was on offer. Being a regional bank comes with an additional layer of risk, especially following the SBV incident. The Fed’s likelihood to be heavy handed to try to shore up the system is bad news for First Horizon. Plus, the threat of an economic downturn continues to loom. This will leave First Horizon exposed with cost cutting one of the life rafts to cling on to.KeyCorp KeyBank storefront logoSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAt first glance, KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) might look like a stellar deal among bank stocks. Its 7.62% dividend yield makes it the kind of financial services stock one might think would help beat inflation. But KeyCorp’s deflated share price is well deserved, and it’s hard to imagine a quick turnaround for the bank.The most recent earnings report showed revenue is down about 50% YoY with a 10% deflated quarterly share price. Efficiency (read: cost cutting) is the name of the game for the bank right now as it looks to put its feet on stable ground. But that’s not a long-term strategy. And importantly the bank’s wide footprint means that it will be difficult to rely on even in the short term. All told, Key still has further to fall before it can be considered a good value purchase.On the date of publication, Marie Brodbeck did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The U.S. government has recommended all Americans ages 6 months and older receive one.Kate MacDowell, a self employed 50-year-old who lives in Portland, Oregon, said she had a vaccine appointment canceled by her healthcare provider, Kaiser Permanente, and has been unable to get another for nearly a month. She and her husband canceled a trip overseas in late September in part because they could not find the shots.""It used to be that even if it was scarce you could find somewhere that you could drive to get it,"" said MacDowell. ""You have the federal government or the county health department saying go get your vaccine, and it's just impossible.""Kaiser did not comment on MacDowell's experience in Oregon. The multi-state healthcare provider, target of a 3-day strike by 75,000 workers this week, said it does not cover out of network vaccinations except in California, where by law members can get reimbursed for COVID-19 vaccines from non-Kaiser providers including retail pharmacies until Nov. 11.The U.S. government in May ended the COVID public health emergency declaration during which it bought the shots and provided them to all Americans for free.Story continuesIn the current privatized system, health insurance plans by law must cover the shots at no cost. Pharmacies and health providers order the shots upfront from manufacturers and receive their supply from distributors.Pfizer and Moderna say they have shipped the shots as planned.At the beginning of last week, Pfizer said it had shipped and delivered more than 10 million doses of its 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine, including more than 1 million pediatric doses. Moderna has also said it has shipped millions of doses.CVS, the largest U.S. pharmacy chain, said on Thursday it was still experiencing delivery delays from its wholesalers.Walmart said it is offering updated COVID shots in all stores as supply becomes available. Walgreens, a unit of Walgreens Boots Alliance, said all stores now have the supply needed to meet demand in their communities.McKesson, one of the largest U.S. wholesalers, said it has distributed over 3.8 million shots so far. It acknowledged a need to ramp up across the supply chain, saying that may have impacted delivery dates for some customers.""We are working diligently to turn COVID-19 inventory as quickly as it is received and are growing our fulfillment of orders daily,"" a spokesperson said.Cardinal Health, another major distributor, said it also shipped several million COVID-19 vaccines ""with some minor and short-term shipping delays.""PHARMACIES PAY UPFRONT TOOAfter widespread reports of payment refusals early in the campaign, health insurance executives met with government officials on Sept. 27 and said plans are reimbursing vaccines given by in-network providers.""Health insurance providers continue to educate Americans about where and how to get their COVID vaccines within their plan’s coverage,"" David Allen, a spokesperson for insurance lobby group AHIP said.Still, some people told Reuters they are being told at pharmacies where they got COVID shots previously that the new ones are not covered by their plan at that location.Independent pharmacists are facing a different issue. Now that the government is no longer footing the bill for their vaccine supply, pharmacy owners need to pay for the shots.""I was hesitant to order as much as I knew I would need right out of the gate because they also had some restrictions on their return policy,"" said David Kohll of Kohll's Pharmacy, which has six locations in Nebraska. ""That made me pull the reins back a little bit.""An HHS spokesperson said the department ""has engaged closely on these issues, even with the transition to the commercial market.""Some people told Reuters their insurer instructed them to pay upfront and seek reimbursement if their pharmacies asked for payment.James Daily, a 43-year-old software developer from Readington, New Jersey, paid close to $600 last month to get shots for himself, his wife and his oldest daughter, and said he's had trouble finding an appointment for his 4-year old daughter.State regulations on vaccine administration for young children vary.Dr. Suzanne Berman, a pediatrician in Crossville, Tennessee, said she was concerned about losing money.""Demand has really slacked off, so I don't want to buy a lot of product that's going to go to waste,"" she said.

But you have a problem if you face massive losses more than once in a while. So take a moment to sympathize with the long term shareholders of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), who have seen the share price tank a massive 71% over a three year period. That might cause some serious doubts about the merits of the initial decision to buy the stock, to put it mildly. And over the last year the share price fell 36%, so we doubt many shareholders are delighted. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 17% in the last three months.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Although the share price is down over three years, PayPal Holdings actually managed to grow EPS by 19% per year in that time. This is quite a puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share price. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.Revenue is actually up 12% over the three years, so the share price drop doesn't seem to hinge on revenue, either. It's probably worth investigating PayPal Holdings further; while we may be missing something on this analysis, there might also be an opportunity.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. If you are thinking of buying or selling PayPal Holdings stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Story continuesA Different PerspectivePayPal Holdings shareholders are down 36% for the year, but the market itself is up 18%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 5% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It is all well and good that insiders have been buying shares, but we suggest you check here to see what price insiders were buying at.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

McKinsey forecasts the global autonomous vehicle market will reach $614 billion by 2030 alone, and many of the biggest names in autos and tech have already splashed out to get ahead of the curve.Autonomous trials are underway in cities across the US, with GM’s driverless unit Cruise operating in 15 locations across the US, as well as in Dubai and Japan, and Google’s Waymo running two ongoing trials in America.It's been a long road to get here, with increasing levels of autonomy. But hiccups like Ford and VW-backed Argo AI getting shut down, and other well-funded startups downsizing, show that solving the autonomy conundrum remains elusive.Some believe technology leaps — such as what’s happening with AI — will solve problems of autonomy, with companies like Nvidia pumping out cutting-edge chips for faster processing of AI tasks. Or look at Tesla’s Dojo supercomputer, which aims to train Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) raw processing power to learn and iterate much faster than previous systems.A few startups are making waves in the space too. May Mobility, an Ann Arbor, Mich.-based autonomous ridesharing transit company, operates self-driving shuttles in locations including Ann Arbor and Grand Rapids, Mich., and even Hiroshima, Japan.“We sell long-term transportation contracts to businesses and governments, and what this allows us to do is to create a gentle onramp for the technology,” May Mobility CEO Edwin Olson said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “So we don't have to solve every driving problem on day one, but we can grow our technology bit by bit.”The Toyota Sienna Autono-MaaS vehicle (May Mobility) (May Mobility)May Mobility’s offering is “microtransit” services for municipalities, with shuttles that can handle five riders at a time. The company is using strategic partner Toyota’s Sienna Autono-MaaS minivans, which are essentially autonomous platforms that can use May Mobility’s software and sensor setups.May Mobility uses its own self-driving technology, which is based on the company’s multi-policy decision-making (MPDM) software. The company says its MPDM software can think like a human, by observing “its surroundings and all the possible variables and then [waiting] as long as possible before committing to a specific action,” even in a situation it's never encountered before.Story continuesMay Mobility believes the way to solve the autonomous puzzle is by starting small, and going where services are most acutely needed — at the local level, and even suburban areas. For example, May Mobility is helping senior citizens in Sun City, Ariz., get around town.The future of May Mobility: the Toyota e-Palette prototype (May Mobility) (May Mobility)Cities and communities are also where the company sees itself making money. Olson says May Mobility wants to start in municipalities that have bus systems that are underperforming or where public transit systems are not optimized.“We're really focused on building the business part of autonomous vehicles, not just building research and development prototypes,” Olson said. “We believe that the first markets will be the ones where the unit economics are the strongest. Those tend to be in municipal and business deployments, where the revenues can be quite high, but you can also control a lot of the costs that would otherwise accrue to the vehicle.”Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

37,57c182a9-5849-34c3-b431-df066050b09c,KLAC,2023-10-08,KLA's (NASDAQ:KLAC) investors will be pleased with their fantastic 446% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/klas-nasdaq-klac-investors-pleased-140035651.html,1696687235,STORY,['KLAC'],"[Buying shares in the best businesses can build meaningful wealth for you and your family. While not every stock performs well, when investors win, they can win big. For example, the KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) share price is up a whopping 402% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. Then again, the 8.8% share price decline hasn't been so fun for shareholders. We note that the broader market is down 3.7% in the last month, and this may have impacted KLA's share price.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for KLA To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, KLA managed to grow its earnings per share at 37% a year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 38%. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how KLA has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. If you are thinking of buying or selling KLA stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of KLA, it has a TSR of 446% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that KLA has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 51% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 40%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with KLA .Of course KLA may not be the best stock to buy.

(NYSE:OKE) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/55-institutional-ownership-oneok-inc-110058548.html,1696762858,STORY,['OKE'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, ONEOK's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 37% ownershipUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyA look at the shareholders of ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 55% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about ONEOK. See our latest analysis for ONEOK ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About ONEOK?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in ONEOK. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see ONEOK's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. ONEOK is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.0% and 5.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of ONEOKWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of ONEOK, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$192m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 44% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over ONEOK. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand ONEOK better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for ONEOK   you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 2.4%, which is fairly typical for the industry. View our latest analysis for McDonald's McDonald's' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageUnless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. The last dividend was quite easily covered by McDonald's' earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 31.0%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 46%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendMcDonald's Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $3.08, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $6.08. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 7.0% per annum over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.McDonald's Could Grow Its DividendSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that McDonald's has grown earnings per share at 9.8% per year over the past five years. Shareholders are getting plenty of the earnings returned to them, which combined with strong growth makes this quite appealing.McDonald's Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 2 warning signs for McDonald's that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Is McDonald's not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

Rowe Price Group implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 20 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Recent sales by insiders A look at the shareholders of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 77% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of T. Rowe Price Group, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for T. Rowe Price Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About T. Rowe Price Group?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that T. Rowe Price Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at T. Rowe Price Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in T. Rowe Price Group. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 12% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 9.0% and 6.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of T. Rowe Price GroupThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.We can report that insiders do own shares in T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.. Insiders own US$480m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipWith a 21% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over T. Rowe Price Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Martin Marietta Materials'  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Martin Marietta Materials How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Martin Marietta Materials is:13% = US$961m ÷ US$7.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.13 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Martin Marietta Materials' Earnings Growth And 13% ROETo start with, Martin Marietta Materials' ROE looks acceptable. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 13%. This certainly adds some context to Martin Marietta Materials' moderate 9.6% net income growth seen over the past five years.We then compared Martin Marietta Materials' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 19% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is MLM fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Martin Marietta Materials Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Martin Marietta Materials' three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 19% (implying that it retains 81% of its income), which is on the lower side, so it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business.Moreover, Martin Marietta Materials is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 15% over the next three years. Despite the lower expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Martin Marietta Materials' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings.

(NASDAQ:MDLZ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 79% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$8.2b last week. However, the 17% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Mondelez International, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Mondelez International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Mondelez International?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Mondelez International. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Mondelez International's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Mondelez International. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.1%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.4% and 4.4% of the stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Mondelez InternationalThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Mondelez International, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$122m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 21% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Mondelez International. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance.

55,84ae73e3-79d2-36f5-ab6e-ee2b67e7e287,KO,2023-10-08,Why The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) Looks Like A Quality Company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-coca-cola-company-nyse-120031392.html,1696766431,STORY,['KO'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), by way of a worked example.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola is:38% = US$11b ÷ US$28b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.38 in profit.Does Coca-Cola Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Coca-Cola has a superior ROE than the average (17%) in the Beverage industry.roeThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCoca-Cola's Debt And Its 38% ROECoca-Cola does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.57. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of the complex world of US tax filing, go to 5 Tax Free Retirement Countries for US Citizens.The Complex World of U.S. Tax FilingOn average, Americans spend $250 and 13 hours each when filing their annual returns. Individuals earning less than $73,000 annually have access to a free tax filing service that they can utilize, too. However, only 4% tend to make use of the service. Analysis of IRS (Internal Revenue Service) data and a NerdWallet survey supervised by the Harris Poll indicates that in 2020 alone, out of 148 million individual tax returns, only 4.2 million were filed for free. On average, this gap of approximately 87 million taxpayers can fuel as much as $13 billion annually into the coffers of tax preparation companies and professionals.In light of this, the US Government Accountability Office has noted that the IRS encourages taxpayers to file their tax returns electronically. This practice saves them money and allows tax payers to get their refunds faster. Even then, there is a low use of the IRS Free File, which in turn raises questions about its awareness amongst tax payers. While it is true that there are tax payers who need to consult tax professionals about their specific situations, it doesn't apply to all.The low usage of Free File is exactly what the private tax corporations are seeking, critics observe. Nina Olson, the national taxpayer advocate, further highlights that under the agreement between IRS and private sector firms, the former cannot develop a ""direct"" filing option for the taxpayers. Moreover, this agreement also prohibits the IRS from developing an ""automated return-free"" option, that can let it calculate and generate taxes for individuals. The agreement stands because these private sector firms have the best technology and expertise in electronic tax preparation, and a Public Private Partnership seems the best way forward.Story continuesApart from the successful lobbying against the Free File service, major tax prep giants such as H&amp;R Block, Inc. (NYSE:HRB) and Turbo Tax, owned by Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), have also been sponsoring ads of the free versions of their tax software that are ungoverned by the Free File Alliance rules. As evidenced by the figures, preparation and filing of taxes is big business in the United States of America. H&amp;R Block, Inc. (NYSE:HRB) and similar tax prep companies have spent millions since the 1990s to oppose such free filing systems. Due to such allegations and stricter levels of scrutiny by the IRS; H&amp;R Block, Inc. (NYSE:HRB) left the Free File Alliance in 2020. TurboTax by Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) followed suit in 2021.Derrick Plummer, a spokesman for Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), has been stressing the free options that already are available, saying that,“An IRS direct-to-e-file system is redundant and will not be free – not free to build, not free to operate, and not free for taxpayers,” Plummer said, adding that it “will unnecessarily cost taxpayers billions of dollars.”H&amp;R Block, Inc. (NYSE:HRB) said that the direct e-file pilot ""continues to be a solution in search of a problem."" It further states that ""this pilot is unnecessary and faces significant barriers to providing comprehensive tax preparation services.""While the US tax filing system is complex, the IRS should extend efforts to raise awareness about its Free File service. Moreover, the agency should follow suit of countries such as Germany and UK that provide their taxpayers with varying levels of tax filing ease. Many of these countries also have tax policies that do not tax foreign retirement income. For those seeking a better quality of life and potential cost savings, these countries can be appealing options for retirement.Tax-free Retirement CountriesRetirement abroad can sound like a dream, but people often tend to forget about details such as taxes. Many countries offer retirement options for individuals relying solely on social security, yet others provide affordable healthcare or even attractive beach destinations in the Caribbean. However, foreign expats, especially Americans, should know that they cannot escape their taxes. If you are a US citizen, you are required to pay your taxes regardless of where you choose to live.Therefore, it can be safe to assume that as a US citizen, you are liable to pay your taxes abroad under the same rules that apply retirement taxes stateside. However, the problem arises when you end up paying taxes twice. While Americans must file a US tax return, most also have to file a foreign tax return too. As a result, they end up paying taxes twice and fail to stretch their retirement incomes, which was their primary intention of retiring to the country.Many options exist to help Americans avoid double taxation when retiring abroad. The first option is retiring to a tax-free country. Establishing residence in a country that does not tax foreign income allows Americans to free themselves of their foreign tax obligations. However, they may not be some of the easiest countries to retire to, like Mauritius or Indonesia. It is important, therefore, that a tax free country must be easy to retire to and also cheap to allow retirement savings to go higher. Some of the cheapest countries for retirement include Dominican Republic, Cambodia, and Portugal.Other options for Americans to avoid double taxation include retiring to countries that the US has established tax treaties with. These treaties establish the country to which a particular expatriate will be liable for taxes, providing a safeguard against double taxation for citizens. For those individuals who wish to retire to a country that the US does not have a tax treaty with, there is another option called the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion. For those who qualify for the FEIE, they can exclude a certain amount of foreign source income from their US taxation. Finally, another tax break for US expats is called the Foreign Tax Credit. A foreign tax credit lets a dollar-for-dollar credit for at least part of an individual’s taxes to a foreign government.10 Tax Free Retirement Countries for US CitizensATGImages / Shutterstock.comMethodologyIn order to compile the list of tax-free retirement countries for US citizens, we began by identifying countries that don’t tax foreign income through government sources and related publications. After identifying these countries, we assessed them based on their quality of life rankings, ease of gaining citizenship, and their costs of living. The sources used for these rankings are Numbeo and Insider Monkey.We assigned scores to evaluate each factor and then calculated the total scores for each country. Places were ranked in ascending order from the lowest to the highest scores.Here are the best tax free retirement countries for US Citizens:10. GreeceInsider Monkey Score: 5Around 30,000 US expats live in Greece. Steeped in history and culture, the country is one of the best tax free retirement countries for US citizens in Europe. From the Greek cuisine and historical landmarks in Athens to top-class beaches and seaside taverns in Corfu, there are plenty of best places to retire in Greece. With regard to taxes in retirement, the US and Greece have signed a tax treaty together. The treaty ensures that US expats don’t pay taxes on the same income to both US and Greek tax authorities. Pensions and withdrawals from non-Greek private pension schemes are taxed at an annual flat rate of 7%. In case the tax is already paid in the US, tax credits and deductions can be applied against the 7% tax in Greece.9. MaltaInsider Monkey Score: 6Ranked as one of the easiest countries to retire to, Malta is home to sunny weather and friendly people. Under the Malta Retirement Program (MRP), an individual who is aged 55 or older, receives a pension as their regular source of income and owns or rents a property in Malta, may obtain a retirement visa. Living in the country is approximately 36% cheaper than in the USA. Like Greece, Malta and the US also have a tax treaty with each other. Under this treaty, if the United States pays social security to a US expat residing in Malta, only the US is eligible to tax that social security income.8. PortugalInsider Monkey Score: 7Portugal is a popular retirement destination and also one of the cheapest. The European country is home to more than 10,000 expats. From enjoying the golden sand beaches in the Algarve to relishing the miradouros in Lisbon, there are plenty of  best places to retire in Portugal. Individuals retiring to this country often seek Non-habitual Residence (NHR) status in Portugal, a beneficial arrangement granting them 10 years of tax-free income. This includes exemptions on capital gains tax as well.7. St. Kitts and NevisInsider Monkey Score: 8Crowned as one of the best places to retire in the Caribbean, St. Kitts and Nevis is home to beautiful beaches, volcanic peaks, and lush rainforests. Individuals can retire to the country through Citizenship by Investment program. Moreover, the cost of living on the island is extremely reasonable too, approximating $1,200. The country does not have any income tax, inheritance tax, or capital gains tax. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best tax free retirement countries for US citizens from the USA.6. EcuadorInsider Monkey Score: 10Affordable living costs, nice beaches, and friendly locals make for the perfect retirement in Ecuador. However, the cherry on top is that any foreign income taxed in another jurisdiction, in this case, the United States, is not taxed in the country. The country also motivates individuals to buy properties and establish residence there. Low property taxes are applied, too.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Tax Free Retirement Countries for US Citizens.Suggested Articles:12 Best Places to Retire in Austria12 Best Places to Retire in Dominican Republic12 Best Cities to Retire in Central AmericaDisclosure: none. 10 Tax Free Retirement Countries for US Citizens is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, UnitedHealth Group achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 13% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 15% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that UnitedHealth Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, UnitedHealth Group's TSR for the last 5 years was 118%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveUnitedHealth Group shareholders are up 5.5% for the year (even including dividends). But that return falls short of the market. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 17% per year for five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand UnitedHealth Group better, we need to consider many other factors.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, the ROCE of Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Procter &amp; Gamble is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.22 = US$19b ÷ (US$121b - US$36b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, Procter &amp; Gamble has an ROCE of 22%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 15% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble roceIn the above chart we have measured Procter &amp; Gamble's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsProcter &amp; Gamble has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 47% over the last five years. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayTo bring it all together, Procter &amp; Gamble has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. Since the stock has returned a staggering 107% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Procter &amp; Gamble does have some risks though, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Procter &amp; Gamble  that you might be interested in.Procter &amp; Gamble is not the only stock earning high returns.

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For instance, the price of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) stock is up an impressive 118% over the last five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 21% gain in the last three months.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 22% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 17% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveRegeneron Pharmaceuticals shareholders gained a total return of 16% during the year. But that return falls short of the market. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 17% over five years. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. Most investors take the time to check the data on insider transactions.
