To skip our detailed analysis of current market dynamics, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Bargain Stocks To Buy in August.Fitch Downgrades US Debt - AAA to AA+On August 2, Fitch Ratings downgraded the US credit rating from a long-held AAA to AA+ while holding a Stable Outlook. The downgrade came in light of the country's ""expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years, a high and growing general government debt burden, and the erosion of governance relative to 'AA' and 'AAA' rated peers over the last to decades,"" according to Fitch. In light of this downgrade, US markets have been down for the day. The S&amp;P 500 fell by 65.64 basis points, or 1.44%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 355.50 basis points, or 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite index fell by 316.56 basis points, or 2.22%, on August 2. While some are worried that this is signaling the end to the extended stock rally seen in the markets so far this year, others don't seem to be all too worried about the downgrade.On August 2, CNBC's Closing Bell showed a snippet from an earlier conversation with Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. According to Dimon, the Fitch downgrade ""doesn't really matter that much."" He also noted that while there are several countries now that are higher-rated than the US, these countries continue to live under the ""American military enterprise,"" highlighting that the US still retains its international dominance. Additionally, Liz Young, the head of investment at SoFi, also noted at CNBC's Closing Bell that this downgrade isn't a surprise, but it's also not a big deal for the US at present. The country very narrowly avoided a default two months ago, and the state of the markets and the economy continues to be volatile.Is A Pause In The Rally A Good Thing?However, this should not worry investors too much. According to Young, the pause in the stock market rally after the downgrade and the ensuing market pullback may even be healthy for the market in the long run. Finally, Josh Brown, the CEO, and co-founder of Ritholtz Wealth Management, also noted during the closing bell that before the downgrade, the average gains for the top 20 S&amp;P 500 stocks stood at around 83%, and these same stocks have fallen by about 3% on average after the Fitch downgrade. Brown believes that investors should consider this an opportunity to find stocks to go long on rather than pulling out of these companies entirely.Story continuesMost of the stocks that have been on the rise in the S&amp;P 500 so far this year include tech stocks, primarily, followed by other sectors such as consumer staples and healthcare, among more. Sectors like these that have largely been performing well in 2023 can serve as excellent investment opportunities at present since top-tier stocks in these areas are currently down. Investors can thus add these names to their portfolios at a bargain if they act fast and act smart. Companies like Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), and AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO), among several others, are considered to be some of the best bargain stocks in the market today, according to analysts. However, other stocks that have particularly begun falling in light of the Fitch downgrade may also be worth taking a look at right now. They may well be considered to be some of the best cheap stock options to buy today. Since the S&amp;P 500's top performers were the ones that took the biggest hits after the downgrade, picking them up now may also ensure that investors get some of the best stocks to buy and hold for 20 years or more. Considering the above, we have compiled a list of some good bargain stock options for investors heading into August.12 Best Bargain Stocks To Buy in AugustImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyTo select the stocks for our list, we used a stock screener to first find stocks with P/E ratios below 20.

The analyst also maintained a price target of $637 on the shares.Baron Funds said the following about Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“These positive effects were somewhat offset by adverse stock selection in managed health care, where the Fund’s investments in health insurance leaders Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) and Elevance Health, Inc. were a modest drag on performance. Humana and Elevance Health were down during the quarter because of commentary from UnitedHealth Group Incorporated management indicating that medical cost trends were running at the high end of their guidance driven by higher levels of outpatient medical activity, particularly among Medicare patients. We think UnitedHealth, Humana, and Elevance will be able to manage through an uptick in medical cost trends, but we modestly reduced our positions in Humana and Elevance due to the potential impact on earnings.We continue to own UnitedHealth, Humana Inc., and Elevance Health, Inc. because we believe these companies will be able to manage through this period without a material earnings impact, but we did modestly reduce our positions in Humana and Elevance Health.”8.

Any number of examples between large cap tech companies and more mature companies could illustrate this very same point, but we find this specific case most interesting because of its history.Note that in late 2014/early 2015 these multiples crossed one another. The relative harmony between Alphabet and Autozone lasted for just shy of a year at that time, before Alphabet’s shares surged and Autozone’s shares slumped. This relationship need not matter for markets, though we think there is some signal for investors. Autozone today trades at the highest multiples of its recent history, while Alphabet trades at its lowest. Meanwhile, despite growth estimates dropping considerably at Alphabet and appreciating modestly at Autozone, Alphabet will outgrow Autozone by a wide margin over the next five years…” (Click here to read the full text)6.

4,9e14adcd-da7e-31bb-b5f0-df1626262d0f,SCHW,2023-08-03,Best Long-Term Investment Stocks to Buy,Kiplinger,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-long-term-investment-stocks-172831591.html,1690997311,STORY,"['CVX', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'MCD', 'MDT', 'SCHW']","[Some of the best long-term investment stocks include companies that are in good financial standing, have a low valuation and pay consistent dividends.Folks seeking out the best long-term investment stocks to buy have a few ways to approach the task. One is to follow the advice of Ben Graham, the father of value investing, using his classic book, The Intelligent Investor.Graham suggests that a defensive investor should buy stocks of large, conservatively financed companies with good earnings power. The companies should also be some of the best dividend stocks, with consistent histories of payouts, and have low valuations.However, in today's world, many tech stocks don't pay dividends. Instead, they often return capital to shareholders through large stock buybacks.Therefore, applying Graham's criteria today, the idea is to find the best stocks to buy that return large amounts of capital to shareholders either through dividends and/or stock buybacks.This allows a company to increase its earnings and dividends on a per-share basis. Moreover, the remaining shareholder's stakes rise over time. Both of these factors can push the stock higher.Another Graham criteria is to find stocks with a low valuation. The S&amp;P 500 has a relatively high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31.4 times over the last 10 years. This article will focus on stocks with price-to-earnings ratios that are lower than the broad market.Lastly, we will stick with stocks that have market caps of $100 billion or higher. They must also have low debt ratios and enough cash flow to reduce their debt, as well as pay dividends and/or buybacks.With this in mind, here are the nine of the best long-term investment stocks to buy now. What Is a Stock Buyback?Data is as of Aug. 1. Dividend yields are calculated by annualizing the most recent payout and dividing by the share price.Market value: $3.08 trillionDividend yield: 0.5%Apple (AAPL, $195.60) is the $3 trillion maker of iPhone smartphones, Mac computers, iPads and numerous other products and services.Story continuesiPhones still represent over half of the company's sales, but recently services, which includes the App Store, have started to increase as well. For example, in its latest quarter ending April 1, Apple's services revenue came in at $20.9 billion, or 22% of its $94.8 billion in sales. That is up from 20% a year ago and 18.9% two years ago.So, this massive tech products company is slowly shedding its overreliance on the iPhone, whose models are all very highly priced. While this will take time, the market so far approves of this plan.And why not? The company is generating massive amounts of free cash flow (FCF), which is the money left over after a company covers expenses to run, maintain and expand the business. Last quarter, Apple said it generated strong operating cash flow of $28.6 billion, while returning over $23 billion to shareholders.Apple pays a small dividend, which it recently raised by 4% to 96 cents annually. That gives the stock a low 0.5% dividend yield. However, this cost the company just $3.7 billion, or 13% of its operating flow.The rest of the $23 billion ""returned"" to shareholders was through stock buybacks. In fact, Apple raised the amount it says it will spend this year on share repurchases to $90 billion. That represents over 3.3% of its total market value.This will benefit long-term shareholders in Apple stock. First, it will raise AAPL's earnings per share over time through having a lower number of shares outstanding for the income it produces.But in addition, the dividend per share can rise faster than it would otherwise since the dividend payments will be spread over fewer number of shares outstanding. And a third effect will be the soaking up of shares traded in the market – effectively acting as a buying source in the market, pushing the blue chip stock higher.Keep in mind that APPL stock is not overly cheap at the moment, at 28.7 times forward earnings – above its five-year average of 23.7, according to Morningstar. However, it is about below the S&amp;P 500's average, as mentioned earlier.Nevertheless, Apple remains one of the best long-term investment stocks due to its consistent and powerful cash flow, dividends and buybacks.Best Dividend ETFs to Buy NowMarket value: $2.50 trillionDividend yield: 0.8%Microsoft (MSFT, $336.34) operates in every key software arena: operating systems, cloud, gaming, application software, and even artificial intelligence (AI) with its new Bing chatbot.MSFT meets all the necessary qualities for being one of the best long-term investment stocks as it has consistent earnings, is conservatively financed and generates large amounts of free cash flow. Moreover, it pays a dividend and spends most of its FCF on share buybacks.Just like Apple, however, MSFT stock is not necessarily cheap on a relative or even historical basis. For example, Microsoft is trading at 30.4 times forward earnings, which is above its five-year average of 28.6. Still, it's below the S&amp;P 500's long-term average.And long-term investors are likely to do quite well with MSFT. The reasons are quite simple: The company's massive cash flow, its products ubiquity and acceptance, and its shareholder rewards are all working in the stock's favor.For example, Microsoft recently reported a 21% year-over-year increase in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share, while revenue was up 8%. Plus, free cash flow was up 12% from the year prior.But more importantly, the company has plenty of room to increase its shareholder-friendly initiatives over time. This is because it spends just about half its free cash flow on dividends and buybacks. It plows the rest back into the company, reducing debt and making investments and acquisitions.So, in the long run, Microsoft shareholders can expect the company to typically grow profits and cash flow, while consistently hiking its dividends and buybacks. In fact, Microsoft has had 18 consecutive years of raising its dividend. That alone, not counting its buybacks and earnings power, makes the Dow Jones stock worthy of holding as a long-term investment.How to Invest in AIMarket value: $303.4 billionDividend yield: 3.7%Chevron (CVX, $162.30) is an integrated energy and chemicals company with both upstream and downstream operations in the U.S. and around the world.CVX meets the criteria for a good long-term investment as it is conservatively financed, produces good profits and pays an attractive dividend it can afford. Moreover, CVX stock is not expensive and the company is actively buying back shares, helping to push it higher.For example, analysts expect Chevron to make $11.94 per share in fiscal 2023, which has the energy stock trading at 13.6 times forward earnings. This is well below the five-year average of 37.9 times.Moreover, Chevron has 36 years of annual dividend hikes under its belt. This is because despite vicissitudes in the prices of oil and gas and chemical industry cycles, the company has consistently produced large amounts of free cash flow.For example, in Q2, Chevron generated $9.4 billion in operating cash flow before working capital changes, and $2.5 billion in free cash flow. The company spent $2.8 billion on dividends and $4.4 billion on share buybacks, for a record $7.2 billion in total shareholder returns.This shows how Chevron manages a fair balance between investing in the future, as well as rewarding its own shareholders now with its cash flow. And it underscores why CVX is the kind of stock that long-term investors want to have in their portfolio.Stocks With the Highest Dividend Yields in the S&amp;P 500Market value: $116.7 billionDividend yield: 3.2%Medtronic (MDT, $87.68) is a $117 billion medical device and therapies company that originally invented the pacemaker. That is probably relatable to people who are looking for the best retirement stocks. Moreover, the company is extremely profitable, which allows it to pay generous dividends and do large share buybacks.Right now, MDT stock has a 3.2% dividend yield. And this yield will likely continue to rise, given the company has reliably raised its dividend for 46 straight years – including a 1.5% hike in May.Moreover, in fiscal 2023, which ended on April 28, Medtronic bought back $645 million of its shares. That works out to be about 55% of one percent of its $117 billion market cap.That is not much, but every little bit helps towards allowing the company to keep raising its dividend.In addition, at just 17.1 times forward earnings, the stock is inexpensive. What's more, this is well below MDT's five-year average of 19.1 times, according to Morningstar.Meanwhile, Medtronic has about $17 billion in net debt on its balance sheet. This is well below its $52 billion in shareholders' equity. Its cash flow should continue to recover from supply chain issues we've seen in the past few years. That will allow Medtronic to reduce its debt reliance over time.And given its powerful cash flow and shareholder returns, MDT is one of the best long-term investment stocks.Bull Markets vs Bear Markets: The Differences ExplainedMarket value: $119.6 billionDividend yield: 1.5%Charles Schwab (SCHW, $65.72) is a well-known discount brokerage firm and investment banking company with which many baby boomers are familiar.SCHW meets all the best criteria for a long-term investment value strategy. For example, it is conservatively financed, pays a consistent dividend with a 1.5% yield, and has a low valuation.As for that dividend, Schwab has had 34 years of consistently paying its dividend each year. That is well over the 10-year average of the median in its sector.Moreover, Schwab recently reported that its return on equity was 20% in the six months ended June 30, up from 15% in the year-ago period. This indicates a substantial rebound in its earnings power. It also allays concerns that the bank might have been hurt by investors worried about a potential recession.Meanwhile, the financial stock is trading at 17.2 times forward earnings, well below its five-year average of 18.6.While the company did recently decide to pause its share buyback program in light of uncertainty in the financial sector following the spring banking crisis. This is likely to reverse once the Federal Reserve stops pushing interest rates higher, which could act as a major catalyst.Investing Jargon, ExplainedMarket value: $212.5 billionDividend yield: 2.1%McDonald's (MCD, $291.07) is a company that just about every investor knows well, especially if they have children. But few realize that it is actually quite a good long-term investment stock to buy as well.The main reason is that the company generates large amounts of free cash flow. For example, in the last 12 months (LTM) ending March 31, MCD produced $5.7 billion in FCF. That represents 2.7% of its $212 billion market capitalization.MCD uses its free cash flow to pay a very ample dividend, which now yields 2.1%. In addition, it bought back almost $3 billion of its shares over the last year.While some folks might not like MCD's quick service restaurant food, plenty of others do. They love its menu, buy McDonald's fries and hamburgers and generally can't get enough of its food.Moreover, it is conservatively financed as its $37 billion in long-term debt, $33.3 billion after cash, is well-managed by the company's ongoing FCF generation.In addition, shareholders have benefited by its history of annually raising its dividend over the last 46 years.Along with its buybacks, MCD stock is attractively valued. For example, it trades for just 26.8 times earnings. While certainly not cheap, this is below its five-year averageThe bottom line – everyone is ""lovin"" MCD stock for the long term.Stock Picks That Billionaires LoveMarket value: $368.3 billionDividend yield: 2.4%Procter &amp; Gamble (PG, $156.25) is a nearly $370 billion consumer products giant with many iconic brand names – including Downy detergent, Mr. Clean cleaning supplies and Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo – that produce large amounts of cash flow for the company.Most everyone knows Procter &amp; Gamble's brands and are familiar with their solid reputations. But few realize how incredibly profitable the company actually is and why PG is one of the best long-term investment stocks to buy.For example, in the last 12 months ended June 30, PG generated $15.2 billion in operating cash and after $3.0 billion in capex spending, $12.2 billion in free cash flow.The FCF represents a massive 15% of P&amp;G's $81 billion LTM sales, which is a very high free cash flow margin for a consumer products company. In fact, some software companies don't even make those kinds of margins.Moreover, this FCF also funds massive dividends and buybacks for shareholders. The company has raised its dividend annually for the last 66 years. Moreover, in its recent earnings call, Procter and Gamble management said it expects to buy back $5 billion to $6 billion in common stock this fiscal year. That represents about 1.5% of its market capitalization.Nevertheless, PG is not expensive relative to its historical valuation. It trades for just 26.5 times earnings, which is well below its five-year average of 35.0.In other words, Procter &amp; Gamble is reasonably priced, generates large amounts of cash flow from its brands and is working diligently to return value to shareholders. That makes it one of the best long-term investments value buyers can make.Best Defensive ETFs to Protect Your PortfolioMarket value: $61.0 billionDividend yield: 5.4%3M (MMM, $110.56) is a $61 billion industrial conglomerate that operates in four sectors: safety and industrial; transportation and electronics; healthcare; and consumer. The company's mission is to apply science to improve people's lives daily.But MMM is also one of the best long-term investment stocks for folks to own. For example, 3M generated $1.5 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter, and returned $800 million to shareholders via dividends.On top of that, 3M buys back its common stock, with the company repurchasing $1.4 billion of its own shares in 2022.Given its free cash flow, investors can take comfort in knowing that MMM's $6.00 annual dividend, which yields an attractive 5.4%, is probably secure.Plus, 3M stock is cheap, trading at just 11.6 times forward earnings, well below its five-year average of 16.6.Moreover, 3M is conservatively financed. The company reported $11.7 billion in net debt at the end of Q2, which was down 12% on a year-over-year basis.Given its strong cash flow, dividends, buybacks, low valuation and financing, the industrial stock looks like a good long-term investment for value buyers.Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying and SellingMarket value: $267.1 billionDividend yield: 3.0%Coca-Cola (KO, $61.77) is an iconic beverage company that generates large amounts of cash flow for its shareholders with its well-known brands such as Coke, Diet Coke, Fanta, Powerade and Minute Maid.That makes it one of the best long term investments a value buyer can make – just ask Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) holding company is KO's top shareholder. What makes KO so attractive is that it is one of the best dividend stocks on Wall Street, having increased its payouts consistently for the last 60 years straight. Most recently, Coca-Cola in February hiked its dividend by nearly 5%.Today, KO stock yields an attractive 3%, and investors can expect the dividend rate to keep increasing.On top of that, Coca-Cola has a strong common stock buyback program. For example, in the last 12 months ended June 30, it spent $872 million on share repurchases. That represents 33% of 1.0% of its $267 billion market value.KO's dividends and share buybacks are more than covered by $9.5 billion in FCF that management expects to generate during 2023.On top of that, the consumer staples stock is trading at 25.6 times earnings, well below its five-year average of 32.1.So, for the long term-investor, KO stock looks like a good investment, given its strong cash flows and shareholder-friendly initiatives.]"

The annual nationwide survey of 401(k) plan participants finds that 62% of workers see inflation as an obstacle to saving for a comfortable retirement, up from 45% last year, and 42% say stock market volatility is an obstacle, up from 33% last year. Nearly eight in ten (78%) say these conditions are impacting their spending and saving habits, and 36% plan to delay retirement as a result.""When inflation persists for an extended period of time, workers are inevitably going to feel a deeper impact on their wallets,"" said Brian Bender, Head of Schwab Workplace Financial Services. ""While many workers are trying to cut back on spending, some costs are unavoidable and certain areas of their finances have taken a hit. Despite these challenges, retirement saving continues to be a priority for workers, who have maintained their 401(k) savings rates and largely stayed on top of their 401(k) investments over the past year.""Workers now believe they’ll need to save an average of $1.8 million for retirement, compared to $1.7 million last year. While this amount hasn’t shifted drastically, only 37% of workers think it’s very likely they’ll achieve this target, down by 10% from last year. Confidence may have taken a hit, but savers are still hopeful: nearly half still feel somewhat likely to reach their goals and only 14% feel they are not at all likely to reach their goals.401(k): a must-have benefitThe 401(k) is becoming a non-negotiable for job seekers. When considering a new employer, 88% of workers say it is a must-have benefit and three in four would refuse a new job if it did not offer a 401(k) plan. ""Placing such a high priority on their 401(k) is not surprising since it is their primary retirement resource, with workers counting on it to deliver 40% of their retirement income,"" said Marci Stewart, Director, Communication Consulting and Participant Education for Schwab Workplace Financial Services. ""That’s double what workers expect from the next closest source, which is Social Security at 20% of retirement income.""Story continuesCompared to last year, more workers are also saving for retirement in a savings accounts (68% vs 61%), investing in an IRA (47% vs 33%) and investing through a brokerage account (38% vs 29%) as they look to augment their primary retirement fund with other methods of saving and investing.Financial advice: new technologies emerge but workers still prefer the human touchHalf of workers would feel comfortable asking artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT for help with financial planning, but for now, actual adoption is very low (4%). Workers are still most likely to follow advice from a human professional (95%) over computer-generated advice (74%).As in past years, the survey continues to underscore that advice plays a pivotal role in workers’ confidence. Just 27% of workers feel ""very confident"" making 401(k) investment decisions on their own, while that level of confidence nearly doubles to 49% when investment decisions are made with professional help. Most workers (73%) say they would like personalized advice on their 401(k) plan and 39% say they are already receiving such advice through their plan at work.Specifically, workers would like help calculating how much to save for retirement (41%), how to invest their 401(k) (40%), determining when they can afford to retire (38%), and creating a retirement income stream (36%).The SECURE 2.0 effectIn addition to the desire for basic retirement planning guidance, workers also want help understanding how new regulatory and legislative changes like the SECURE 2.0 Act affect their retirement plan. The new law expands retirement plan coverage for more workers and makes other changes to the retirement system to help workers prepare for retirement.Just over half (56%) of workers have heard of SECURE 2.0. Among the provisions in the act, workers are most aware of the increased age for required minimum distributions and the increased 401(k) catch-up contribution limits starting in 2025 for those aged 60 to 63.""It’s encouraging to see that many workers are in-tune with the evolving rules and regulations surrounding their retirement plans,"" said Stewart. ""By understanding what matters to employees, employers can drive engagement as they fine tune their benefit offerings to optimize recruitment and retention.""About the surveyThis online survey of 1,000 U.S. 401(k) plan participants was conducted by Logica Research between April 19 and May 2, 2023. Survey respondents were actively employed by companies with at least 25 employees, were 401(k) plan participants and were 21-70 years old. Survey respondents include participants served by approximately 15 different retirement plan providers. All data is self-reported by study participants and is not verified or validated.

These trends bode well for top semiconductor stocks as the number of chips on devices and machines increases.The iPhone moment of AI has arrived, meaning more chips to train AI models. Every company is considering AI regarding productivity and how it will disrupt their industries. As a result, demand for high-end chips with lots of processing power is growing.But semiconductor usage is also growing in traditional industries. For instance, the semiconductor content in vehicles is rising. EVs require numerous chips for power electronics, battery management systems, motor control, and charging infrastructure. Moreover, modern infotainment, communication, and user interface features on modern vehicles need more semiconductors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith increased applications, semiconductor demand will continue to grow. However, the semiconductor industry is very competitive, with multiple competitors in each segment. Therefore, it’s crucial to pick the winners.Leading semiconductor stocks with high returns will outperform peers. The following companies dominate their categories and will capture most of the value.Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) investment growth and profit trading concept. Nvidia company logo on screen of smartphone against blurred background of up trading stock chartSource: Below the Sky / Shutterstock.comOne of the top semiconductor stocks to participate in the AI theme is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Its chips have the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) and are currently the best in training AI models. These advantages are flowing directly to the company’s financials.On May 24, the stock reported outstanding first-quarter fiscal 2024 results. Total revenues declined 13% year-over-year, but on a sequential basis, they grew 19% from Q4 FY2023.The biggest surprise for the markets was their guidance for the second quarter. Management issued second-quarter revenue guidance of $11.00 billion, which was $4 billion above consensus.Story continuesManagement highlighted that we are in the early innings of accelerated computing and generative AI. “A trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia.Demand for Nvidia’s products is surging as companies enter the AI race. The firm has had to increase supply to meet the increasing demand. This demand bodes well for Nvidia’s revenue going forward.So far, its H100 chip is the best in training AI models in the market. Notably, it enjoys a monopoly with very little competition. Although Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) recently launched a potential competitor, Nvidia has a greater than two-year head start. The MI300X is unlikely to challenge the H100’s dominance any time soon.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) produces analog chips for various applications. While its chips might not garner the buzz like AI chips, they are crucial in everyday applications. Its chips include data converters, embedded processors, amplifiers, radio frequency (“RF”) technologies and power management products.The company focuses on high-quality analog chips that enable it to earn higher margins. Since these chips aren’t subject to Moore’s law, they have long product cycles and limited obsolescence risk.Due to its prudent capital stewardship, Texas Instruments is a top semiconductor stock. Management aligns with shareholders focusing on maximizing free cash flow power share. Since 2004 it has grown the metric at an 11% annual rate.Currently, the analog chip market is in a downturn, but no company is suited to handle the downturn better than Texas Instruments. While smaller players might struggle, it has a robust balance sheet to navigate the cycle. Furthermore, since its chips have long cycles, the company can build up inventory levels and then fulfill customer orders when the eventual recovery happens.Taking a longer-term view, the demand for analog chips is growing. McKinsey expects the total automotive sensor market to reach $468 billion by 2030, representing a 5.6% CAGR. Texas Instruments generates 25% of revenues from automotive and is investing to meet this demand. It’s building new fabs to produce analog and embedded processing chips.For now, TXN stock is one of the top semiconductor stocks to play the digitization and electrification trend. The stock trades at a forward P/E of 24. Additionally, the company pays an attractive 2.6% dividend. With an impressive dividend growth record for 17 consecutive years, expect them to continue flowing.ASML Holding N.V. (ASML)Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.Source: ShutterstockAfter the recent earnings-related sell-off, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the top semiconductor stocks to buy on dips. This semiconductor equipment supplier manufactures deep ultraviolet (DUV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines used in chip production.Today, ASML has a monopoly on EUV lithography machines. This advanced equipment is crucial in making chips, and one machine can cost as much as $200 million. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Samsung, and Intel (NYSE: INTC) are its largest three customers.Due to its monopoly, ASML enjoys tremendous profitability and is among semiconductor stocks with high returns. Over the past few years, gross margins have improved from 46% in FY2018 to over 50% in the last two years. At the same time, free cash flow per share has grown from $6.64 to $19.30 in FY2022.Recently, ASML stock sold off after its earnings and disappointing TSMC results. The decline in TSMC’s revenues highlighted the likelihood of a prolonged downturn in the semiconductor equipment market. However, looking closely at ASML’s second quarter 2023 results paint a different picture.For the quarter, revenues grew sequentially from €6.7 billion to €6.9 billion. In terms of YOY performance, revenue growth was 27.8%. Management also issued an optimistic outlook. “ASML expects strong growth for 2023 with a net sales increase towards 30% and a slight improvement in gross margin, relative to 2022,” said ASML President and CEO Peter Wennink.Given the company’s dominant position, revenues will increase as accelerated computing and artificial intelligence grow.

The bottom line increased 7.9% year over year.The quarterly results reflect continued strong operating performance, core business premium trends that are nearing long-term growth expectations, improved core operations sales, stable persistency, premium growth and continued favorable benefits experience as well as positive underlying trends, particularly in disability products.Unum Group Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseUnum Group price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Unum Group QuoteOperational Update        Total operating revenues of Unum Group were $3.1 billion, up 2% year over year, as higher premium income and other income were offset by lower net investment income. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.4%.Premium increased 3.9% from the prior-year quarter to $2.5 billion. Our estimate was $2.6 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $2.5 billion.Total benefits and expenses increased 0.5% year over year to $2.6 billion, largely attributable to higher commissions, interest and debt expense, amortization of deferred acquisition costs and other expenses. Our estimate for the same was also $2.6 billion.Quarterly Segment UpdateUnum U.S.: Premium income was $1.6 billion, up 4.5% year over year. The figure was in line with our estimate.Adjusted operating income rose 17.5% year over year to $343.1 million, attributable to higher income in the group disability line and supplemental and voluntary line of business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $310 million.Unum International: Premium income of $207.9 million increased 15.9% year over year.  This compares unfavorably with our estimate of $186.6 million. Adjusted operating income was $43.5 million, up 54.8% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $33 million.The Unum U.K. line of business premium income was £143.1 million, up 14.5% from the year-ago quarter due to in-force block growth and higher sales. Adjusted operating income, in local currency, of £34.3 million was up 59.5% from a year ago.The benefit ratio was 72.3, which improved 1560 basis points (bps), due to favorable claim resolutions, primarily driven by higher mortality and higher discount rates on new claims in the group long-term disability product line, and lower inflation-linked experience in benefits.

In developing and monitoring performance against this plan, management considers the actual or potential impacts on these non-GAAP financial measures from actions taken to reduce costs with the goal of increasing gross margin and operating margin. In addition, management relies upon these non-GAAP financial measures to assess whether research and development efforts are at an appropriate level, and when making decisions about product spending, administrative budgets, and other operating expenses. Also, we believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors and enable investors to analyze the results of operations in the same way as management. We have chosen to provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of our operating results, to assess our liquidity and capital position and to analyze financial performance excluding the effect of expenses unrelated to operations, certain non-cash expenses and stock-based compensation expense, which may obscure trends in Qorvo's underlying performance.We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures offer an additional view of Qorvo's operations that, when coupled with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of Qorvo's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting Qorvo's business. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.Our rationale for using these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as their impact on the presentation of Qorvo's operations, are outlined below:Non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin.  Non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin exclude amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring related charges and certain non-cash expenses. We believe that exclusion of these costs in presenting non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin facilitates a useful evaluation of our historical performance and projected costs and the potential for realizing cost efficiencies.We view amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, and customer relationships, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities, determined at the time of an acquisition, rather than ongoing costs of operating Qorvo’s business. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangible assets is a static expense, which is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Although we exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets from these non-GAAP financial measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase price accounting and contribute to revenue generation.We believe that presentation of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin and other non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of stock-based compensation expense assists management and investors in evaluating the period-over-period performance of Qorvo's ongoing operations because (i) the expenses are non-cash in nature, and (ii) although the size of the grants is within our control, the amount of expense varies depending on factors such as short-term fluctuations in stock price volatility and prevailing interest rates, which can be unrelated to the operational performance of Qorvo during the period in which the expense is incurred and generally are outside the control of management. Moreover, we believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense in presenting non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin and other non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors to understand the impact of the expensing of stock-based compensation to Qorvo's gross profit and gross margins and other financial measures in comparison to prior periods. We also believe that the adjustments to profit and margin related to restructuring related charges and certain non-cash expenses do not constitute part of Qorvo's ongoing operations and therefore the exclusion of these items provides management and investors with better visibility into the actual revenue and actual costs required to generate revenues over time and facilitates a useful evaluation of our historical and projected performance. We believe disclosure of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin has economic substance because the excluded expenses do not represent continuing cash expenditures and, as described above, we have little control over the timing and amount of the expenses in question.For the three months ended July 2, 2022 and April 1, 2023, non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin also excluded charges associated with a long-term capacity reservation agreement. Unprecedented disruption resulting from measures taken in China to control the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine negatively impacted demand for 5G handsets in China and EMEA within a short period of time. Due to these extraordinary circumstances, our demand was not expected to support the minimum purchase commitments under a long-term capacity reservation agreement with a foundry supplier which resulted in charges recorded in our cost of goods sold for the three months ended July 2, 2022. Subsequently, for the three months ended April 1, 2023, we elected to apply the remaining pre-paid refundable deposit against portions of monthly purchase commitments for the term of the amended agreement in lieu of ordering certain additional silicon wafers. This election was made to better align component inventory with the timing of the forecasted finished goods demand. This resulted in an impairment to the prepaid refundable deposit recorded in our cost of goods sold for the three months ended April 1, 2023. We believe these charges are not reflective of the performance of our ongoing business.Non-GAAP operating expenses, operating income and operating margin. Non-GAAP operating expenses, operating income and operating margin exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration related costs, gain or loss on assets, asset impairments, restructuring related charges, charges associated with a long-term capacity reservation agreement and certain non-cash expenses. We believe that presentation of a measure of operating expenses, operating income and operating margin that excludes amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense is useful to both management and investors for the same reasons as described above with respect to our use of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin. We believe that acquisition and integration related costs, gain or loss on assets, asset impairments, restructuring related charges, charges associated with a long-term capacity reservation agreement and certain non-cash expenses do not constitute part of Qorvo's ongoing operations and therefore, the exclusion of these costs provides management and investors with better visibility into the actual costs required to generate revenues over time and facilitates a useful evaluation of our historical and projected performance. We believe disclosure of non-GAAP operating expenses, operating income and operating margin has economic substance because the excluded expenses are either unrelated to ongoing operations or do not represent current cash expenditures.Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share exclude the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration related costs, gain or loss on assets, asset impairments, restructuring related charges, charges associated with a long-term capacity reservation agreement and certain non-cash expenses, gain or loss on investments, other expense (income) and also reflect an adjustment of income taxes. The income tax adjustment primarily represents the use of research and development tax credit carryforwards, deferred tax expense (benefit) items not affecting taxes payable, adjustments related to the deemed and actual repatriation of historical foreign earnings, non-cash expense (benefit) related to uncertain tax positions and other items unrelated to the current fiscal year or that are not indicative of our ongoing business operations. We believe that presentation of measures of net income and net income per diluted share that exclude these items is useful to both management and investors for the reasons described above with respect to non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin and non-GAAP operating expenses, operating income and operating margin. We believe disclosure of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share has economic substance because the excluded expenses are either unrelated to ongoing operations or do not represent current cash expenditures.Free cash flow. Qorvo defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities during the period minus property and equipment expenditures made during the period, and free cash flow margin is calculated as free cash flow as a percentage of revenue. We use free cash flow as a supplemental financial measure in our evaluation of liquidity and financial strength. Management believes that this measure is useful as an indicator of our ability to service our debt, meet other payment obligations and make strategic investments. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, our definition of free cash flow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire statement of cash flows.EBITDA. Qorvo adjusts GAAP net income for interest expense, interest income, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and intangible amortization expense, stock-based compensation and other charges that are not representative of Qorvo's ongoing operations (including asset impairments, investment activity, acquisition-related costs, restructuring-related costs and certain charges associated with a long-term capacity reservation agreement) when presenting EBITDA. Management believes that this measure is useful to evaluate our ongoing operations and as a general indicator of our operating cash flow (in conjunction with a cash flow statement which also includes among other items, changes in working capital and the effect of non-cash charges).Non-GAAP ROIC. Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor by measuring the effectiveness of our operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. We use ROIC to track how much value we are creating for our shareholders. Non-GAAP ROIC is calculated by dividing annualized non-GAAP operating income, net of an adjustment for income taxes (as described above), by average invested capital. Average invested capital is calculated by subtracting the average of the beginning balance and the ending balance of equity plus net debt, less certain goodwill.Net debt or positive net cash. Net debt or positive net cash is defined as unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments minus any borrowings under our credit facility and the principal balance of our senior unsecured notes. Management believes that net debt or positive net cash provides useful information regarding the level of Qorvo's indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt.Inventory days on hand. Inventory days on hand is defined as (a) average net inventory for the period, divided by (b) the result of non-GAAP cost of goods sold for the period divided by the number of days in the period.Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures.  Our earnings release contains forward-looking free cash flow, gross margin, income tax rate and diluted earnings per share. We provide these non-GAAP measures to investors on a prospective basis for the same reasons (set forth above) that we provide them to investors on a historical basis. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort due to variability and difficulty in making accurate projections for items that would be required to be included in the GAAP measures, such as stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration related costs, restructuring related charges, gain or loss on assets, asset impairments, gain or loss on investments and the provision for income taxes, which could have a potentially significant impact on our future GAAP results.Limitations of non-GAAP financial measures. The primary material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool compared to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are these non-GAAP financial measures (i) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry, and (ii) exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance, thus limiting their usefulness as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing full disclosure of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the corresponding GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, to enable investors to perform their own analysis of our gross profit and gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, net income per diluted share and net cash provided by operating activities. We further compensate for the limitations of our use of non-GAAP financial measures by presenting the corresponding GAAP measures more prominently.Qorvo will conduct a conference call at 5:00 p.m. ET today to discuss today’s press release.

(NYSE:TMO),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-intrinsic-value-thermo-fisher-130011423.html,1690981211,STORY,['TMO'],"[Key InsightsThermo Fisher Scientific's estimated fair value is US$637 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$546 suggests Thermo Fisher Scientific is potentially trading close to its fair valueOur fair value estimate is 1.4% higher than Thermo Fisher Scientific's analyst price target of US$628In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.31bUS$9.22bUS$11.3bUS$13.1bUS$14.4bUS$15.5bUS$16.5bUS$17.3bUS$18.0bUS$18.6bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 10.17%Est @ 7.76%Est @ 6.06%Est @ 4.88%Est @ 4.05%Est @ 3.47% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$7.7kUS$7.9kUS$9.0kUS$9.7kUS$9.9kUS$9.9kUS$9.7kUS$9.4kUS$9.1kUS$8.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$91bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$19b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.1%) = US$330bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$330b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$155bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$246b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$546, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Thermo Fisher Scientific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.969. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Thermo Fisher ScientificStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Life Sciences market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Thermo Fisher Scientific, there are three relevant elements you should assess:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

MUFG, for approximately $936 million. The issuance is part of a debt-to-equity conversion and will help U.S. Bancorp meet its repayment obligation to MUFG, as agreed upon during the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank N.A.'s core regional banking franchise on Dec 1, 2022.This will increase MUFG Bank’s total shareholding in USB to 4.39% and further strengthen the strategic relationship between the two financial institutions.The debt/equity conversion is projected to have a positive impact on U.S. Bancorp's capital levels. It will increase the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio by roughly 20 basis points, signaling a strengthening financial position for the company.This investment aligns with U.S. Bancorp's capital-building initiatives undertaken during the second quarter of 2023. As a part of this effort, the company incurred $265 million in charges in the quarter related to balance sheet optimization and capital management actions. These were mainly driven by a provision charge of $243 million related to the securitization of nearly $4.4 billion of indirect auto loans and an additional $4.2 billion sale of Union Bank mortgage loans.By satisfying a portion of the repayment obligation through stock issuance, USB can reduce its outstanding debt of $3.5 billion owed to MUFG Union Bank N.A., with the remaining obligation to be paid in cash by the agreed-upon deadline of Dec 1, 2027.Additionally, as part of their collaboration, MUFG Bank and U.S. Bancorp have entered into an agreement to strengthen the non-Japanese yen funding capacity. This agreement provides U.S. Bank National Association, a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp, with complementary U.S. dollar liquidity support, further solidifying the partnership.The collaboration between Mitsubishi UFJ and U.S. Bancorp extends beyond financial investments. Both banks have agreed to collaborate on maintaining banking services for certain Japanese retail customers in the United States. Furthermore, they are exploring opportunities for strategic collaboration in various areas, including digital initiatives, corporate transactions, financial services for Japanese customers and global markets business.The debt-to-equity conversion and the broader collaboration between U.S. Bancorp and MUFG reflect a mutually beneficial partnership. As the transaction progresses, investors will closely watch the impact on U.S. Bancorp's financial health and the potential for further business expansion through strategic alliances.Over the past three months, shares of USB and MUFG have rallied 32.6% and 29.7%, respectively.Three-Month Price PerformanceStory continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, both U.S. Bancorp and Mitsubishi UFJ carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Additionally, last month, Mitsubishi UFJ and Morgan Stanley MS announced plans to deepen their 15-year alliance by merging certain operations within their Japanese brokerage joint ventures.The partnership, originating from MUFG's $9 billion investment in Morgan Stanley during the 2008 financial crisis, will see combined Japanese equity research, sales and execution services for institutional clients at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities and Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities.Additionally, their equity underwriting business will be rearranged between the two brokerage units.

If you want to skip our analysis of businesswomen and female entrepreneurship, you can go directly to 5 Self-Made Female Billionaires Under 50.Presence of Women in the BusinessThe presence of women in the business has become more important than ever before. Today, we live in a globalized world and the internet has created opportunities for everyone to set up and start their business. Even young entrepreneurs are making millions of dollars each month, all thanks to technology and social media platforms such as Youtube owned by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Instagram and Facebook owned by Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META).Women can be as important for a business as men. They bring unique ideas, skills, experiences, and perspectives to the workplace. For companies, it could lead them to succeed in a globally competitive environment. A major feature added by women in business is diversity, including gender, ethnic, age, and cultural diversity. This improves the decision-making and problem-solving capability of a firm. Women bring alternate viewpoints, which can help businesses to target their female audience in various consumer markets. Moreover, women contribute enormously to the global economy, which is substantial considering the global economic crises. Female billionaires are massively contributing to the global economy and self-made female billionaires are ideal for young girls to look up to in their professional life. The Forbes World’s Richest List 2023 states that female billionaires are up in numbers this year, from 327 in 2022 to 337 in 2023. Positives for Women EntrepreneursWomen are making their way to the top in the corporate world along with men. Over the decades, men had dominated top positions of executives in almost all sectors. The evolution of startups and modern technology has paved way for female entrepreneurs to show their skills as executives and businesspeople. As we mentioned earlier, 10% of the women executives are now leading Fortune 500 companies. Story continuesOn 18 November 2022, the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) 2021/2022 Women’s Entrepreneurship Report highlighted women entrepreneurs' statistics. The report suggested that women represent one in three high-growth entrepreneurs in the world. This is quite a development for female entrepreneurs over the past few years. “Women represent two out of every five early-stage entrepreneurs,” said Amanda Elam, the lead author of the 2021/2022 Women’s Entrepreneurship Report. Further, Elam added that women are playing an active role in the entrepreneurial economy. As we mentioned earlier, women are mainly involved in three industries including healthcare, salons and pet care businesses, and scientific and technical services. To add to this, the Women’s Entrepreneurship Report suggests that almost half of women entrepreneurs held stakes in the wholesale and retail sector, with one in five women entrepreneurs involved in the Government and Social Services sector. Whereas, women in the Information, Computers, and Technology (ICT) sector accounted for 2.7% compared to 4.7% of men, who are starting businesses in this sector. ICT has one of the largest shares in the venture market, as it draws the majority of venture capital dollars around the world. E-commerce has been a big market for women entrepreneurs to start their businesses. On February 8, Forbes Advisor shared 38 e-commerce statistics for 2023 which mention that 20.8% of retail purchases are expected to take place online in 2023 and reach 24% by 2026. As half of the women entrepreneurs are in the wholesale and retail business, they have a huge opportunity to take advantage of this online marketplace. Furthermore, Forbes Advisor highlighted that the global e-commerce market is projected to reach $6.3 trillion in 2023 and grow to over $8.1 trillion by 2026. Whereas, the largest e-commerce market shareholder is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), with its online platform accounting for 37.8% of e-commerce sales. As we mentioned earlier, on June 19, SellerApp pointed out that 33% of the retailer sellers on Amazon.com are women entrepreneurs. This creates a great opportunity for women entrepreneurs to continue evolving in the fast-growing e-commerce market. The expansion in the e-commerce marketplace is expected to create opportunities for new players online. Following Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), the rest of the big players in the market include Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), and AliExpress.com owned by Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). Forbes Advisor mentioned that the following e-commerce platforms are the most viewed after Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). As of December 2022, Walmart.com ranked on top with 854.9 million monthly visits in sales followed by eBay.com with 669.5 million visits. The Chinese e-commerce giant, AliExpress.com made it to third place with nearly 651.9 million visits in sales. The positive consumer behavior in the e-commerce market creates huge potential for online businesses worldwide. Nearly 57% of online shoppers shop from international e-commerce platforms. The increasing consumer demand is leading to better-than-expected results for e-commerce companies. Apart from e-commerce, women have made a fortune in other industries, which indicates that female entrepreneurs can dream big and achieve what many think is impossible. One of the self-made female billionaires on our list, Cristina Junqueira, has achieved what everyone might think is an industry where men dominate. In May 2013, Junqueira along with Edward Wible, and David Vélez co-founded Nubank. In December 2021, the digital bank went public on the New York Stock Exchange as N​​u Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NU). Junqueira along with her team has built an empire of $36.49 billion in almost ten years, becoming the fourth largest financial institution in Brazil. Since August 2022 Junqueira has been serving the company as Chief Growth Officer and N​​u Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NU) has made stellar progress under her leadership. On July 25, N​​u Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NU) announced it has crossed 80 million customers in Brazil. Across Latin America which includes Mexico and Colombia, N​​u Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NU) has surpassed 85 million customers. In June 2021, the digital bank had 41 million customers, which has more than doubled in just two years. On May 15, N​​u Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NU) posted first quarter 2023 results with earnings per share of $0.03, surpassing consensus estimates by $0.02. The company recorded revenue of $1.62 billion, a year-over-year rise of 84.51%. Here are some of the comments from the Q1 2023 earnings call:""Over the past two years, Nu was able to double the number of customers from 37 million in early 2021 to more than 79 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023 and already surpassed 80 million customers by April. The strong growth of our customer base associated with the rise in cross-sell and up-sell implied by the high engagement for platform resulted in our quarterly revenues multiplying by almost 7 times in only two years, a triple digit revenue CAGR over this period. The next chart of this slide illustrates our resilient underwriting capabilities. Quarterly gross profit, defined by total revenues, deducted by funding costs, transactional expenses and credit loss allowances, increased by more than 5 times in the period with gross profit margins expanding accordingly even though credit delinquency has increasing the market in which we operate over the past 12 months.This compounded effect should continue to be observed over the coming periods providing a valuable combination of growth with increasing profitability in our platform. In Brazil, where we have been operating for nine years, our clients already account for a remarkable 46% of the total adult population of the country.It’s staggering and at the same time gratifying to think that almost one in two Brazilians that own a smartphone is a Nu Bank customer. In Mexico and Colombia, where we have been for three years or less, our share of the total population is significantly lower, representing a tremendous opportunity for growth as we expand our product offering and create lasting relationships with our clients. But so far, the experience we’re having in Mexico and in Colombia is more positive than what we saw in Brazil in the first few years. With three years of operations in Brazil, we had 1.2 million customers, representing a penetration of less than 1% of the adult population of the country at that time. Lower than what we now have in Mexico and Colombia.While our customer penetration in Brazil is significant, when we delve into the market share we actually own in each profit pool, it is clear that we still have substantial room to expand our presence.""11 Self-Made Female Billionaires Under 50Stasique/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo take data for the self-made female billionaires under 50, we looked into the Forbes list of the World’s Real-Time Billionaires.

For the tenth year in a row, bulk retailer Walmart (WMT) has taken the top spot for 2022 rankings. Alyson Shontell, Fortune Editor-in-Chief and Chief Content Officer, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how energy and technology trends could shift revenue forecasts. Shontell notes Saudi Aramco — which jumped to the number two spot after placing sixth in 2021 — as a contender for future rankings, describing the oil company's $159 billion in profits as a ""behemoth"".Video Transcript- Well, soaring energy prices last year affected more than just your wallet at the pump. They fueled oil companies bottom lines as well, demonstrated in Fortune's annual ranking of the world's biggest companies by revenue, the Fortune Global 500.For fiscal year 2022, Walmart took the top spot again for the 10th year in a row in fact, boasting $611 billion in sales last year. But major oil company, Saudi Aramco, is number two on the list up from the sixth position in 2021. For more on this, we turn to Allison Shontell, fortune editor-in-chief and chief content officer.It's funny because already we had seen oil prices start to go down last year, but the revenue at companies like Saudi Aramco still went up.ALYSON SHONTELL: Massive. Massively. The revenue went up 51% last year, which was that 6-point position boost that you saw on our list. I mean, I can't stress enough, Saudi Aramco is a monster. It's a behemoth. It had $159 billion worth of profit. By comparison, Apple was just under $100 billion in profits. I mean, this is the most profitable company in the history of companies. So they're able to pump gas much cheaper, pump oil much cheaper than you can here in the States. That is to their benefit. And it's you're seeing all of the oil companies boosted pretty significantly on our list this year.- And this year, there was an increase in the number of US companies on the list, correct?Story continuesALYSON SHONTELL: Yes, the highest since 2010. So the US had a good year. We performed pretty well globally. China and the greater China area is also on the rise. Europe had a pretty weak year the euro. I think is to blame. We expect to see rebound a bit next year as things sort out there. But yes, the US had the most companies on about 136.- And then there's the role of big tech, which we talk about all the time. People sort of raise eyebrows at how dependent the rally here has been on big tech, for example. Big tech also has a big presence on the list as you might imagine.ALYSON SHONTELL: It does, and it's hugely revenue-generating, profit-generating. At the same time, I think while this year is steady and Walmart was number one for the 10th year in a row, I think next year, you might start to see the seeds of a lot of change. I mean, Saudi Aramco narrowly knocked Walmart off its perch. The revenue generated was within $20 billion. Definitely can close that gap if the trend continues.In big tech specifically, though, you're seeing AI hasn't really been felt in the numbers yet, and that trend will play out for the next five, 10 years. I mean, come 10 years time, and you could see a massive unseating in tech depending on the decisions that their CEOs make right now.- So speaking about the numbers, besides revenue, what are the other metrics that you all measure when compiling this list?ALYSON SHONTELL: So revenue is the primary. I mean, you could argue that. You could do the biggest company in the world based on profits. That's not what we do otherwise, Amazon would not be number four. It would be not even on the list. So we do it by revenue. We always have for 34 years. This is how we've done it. This is also how we do our Fortune 500 list, which is just the US companies, and we did that two months ago. We do look at profits, we look at year over year growth. Those are the primary factors.- And how should people use the list? Like, it's fun to talk about. It's interesting to talk about the size both for the Fortune 500 and the Global 500. Sort of as a tool as well, how should people think about it?ALYSON SHONTELL: I mean, I think people should look at the overall trends. I mean, so this is the most revenue generating year in 2022 that we've ever seen. $41 trillion in revenue generated by these companies, that's a third of the world GDP in those numbers, and that's concentrated in China, Japan, and the US.- Do the numbers ever go down? Do the revenue-- like, have there been years when revenue has fallen?ALYSON SHONTELL: Profits have and profits did this past year. The revenue has just been ticking up.- And when you compare 2021 to 2022, were there any big surprises to you when you were kind of heading into the 2022 year?ALYSON SHONTELL: I mean, I think we knew that energy would be a big sector. But I mean, really, just to see the 40% increase really across the board, whether that's Shell or that's Exxon or that's Saudi Aramco, I mean, that was huge. I think to see the sheer size and scale of Saudi Aramco, I mean, the profit size there is just so big and the ramifications for that are so big.I mean, Saudi Arabia has so much money to spend because a lot of those profits go into the public investment fund. And they say that they have over $3 trillion to spend by 2030. I mean, a lot of businesses are going to have to be making decisions of do we want to do business with Saudi Arabia? That is a whole bunch of cash that we're looking at. So things like that, I think, really stand out.]"

Today is a significant milestone for Xylem as we have the pleasure to present the performance and outlook of quite a different company than just a quarter ago as we describe our ability to make an impact on the world as society deals with growing water challenges. The combination of Xylem and Evoqua has already begun taking shape as an even stronger global platform that will have a profoundly positive impact on our customers and communities. We have a responsibility in front of us to help at exactly the moment when the world's water challenges are coming into more acute focus than ever. When we completed the acquisition in May, our capability to meet this moment expanded along with our opportunities for growth. Now, 10 weeks into the integration of these 2 great enterprises, we are even more confident about the value we will create with our combined company. There are 3 things that underpin that confidence. First, the team is delivering impressive performance across both companies. I am so very proud of our team for staying focused on serving our customers at a potentially distracting time. Each team, both legacy Xylem and Evoqua turned in a quarter significantly exceeding expectations and giving us brisk momentum for the future. Second, our early progress on integration has increased our confidence in the cost synergies we previously laid out and the growth synergies ahead of us. We have moved well forward on both sources of value. And third, as water challenges continue to intensify for our customers across many parts of our economy and society, they are seeking simpler, more affordable ways to tackle them. While we are now even more strongly positioned to solve those needs and capture that demand with increased exposure to attractive, durable end markets. We'll come back at these bigger points in a few minutes, but I want to make sure we also give appropriate attention to the very strong quarter we just closed. As we shared in our press release this morning, we significantly exceeded expectations on revenue growth, margin and earnings per share. Organic revenue growth was 15%, with total reported revenue growth of 26%. EPS was up 32% and grew 28%, excluding the impact of the acquisition. And we delivered EBITDA margin well above our guide at more than 19%. It was driven by strong demand and the team's continued focus on pricing as well as ongoing continuous improvement aimed at simplifying how we serve our customers. Organically, all segments contributed double-digit revenue growth in all end markets. And each of our regions grew, led by notably strong pace in the U.S. and a solid recovery in China. Our legacy backlog was up 7%. And then we added Evoqua's backlog of more than $1 billion, and the 2 together bring our total backlog to $5.3 billion. Well, we have a lot to do with the integration of these 2 great companies. We have strong commercial momentum, which gives us the confidence to raise our guidance for the year. And again, I want to thank every one of our team members around the world and our partners for what they are doing every day to deliver real impact to our customers and our communities. In a moment, we'll give more color on our outlook as well as detail on our end markets and regions. But first, I'm going to hand it over to Sandy to dig into the quarter's strong results.Sandra E. RowlandThanks, Patrick. Please turn to Slide 5. Since this is the first time we are reporting as a combined company, I would like to walk you through how we will cover our performance. We now have 4 reporting segments: Evoqua's Applied Product Technologies business has been integrated into water infrastructure, immediately combining our 2 complementary treatment product businesses. Evoqua's Integrated Solutions &amp; Services business, or ISS, is reported as its own segment, providing continued transparency on the segment's results. Our other 2 segments, Measurement &amp; Control Solutions and Applied Water are unchanged. Additionally, since this quarter includes about a month of Evoqua's results, we have laid out organic results compared to our previously shared expectations and broken out the impact of the acquisition. Unless otherwise stated, all growth rates shared are on an organic basis. And lastly, we have reported EPS on an adjusted basis that adds back noncash purchase accounting intangible amortization from the Evoqua acquisition and Xylem's previous acquisitions. We have therefore recast 2022 amounts for comparison purposes. And now let's turn to Slide 6 for our quarter's results. The team delivered strong performance, beating our expectations for both growth and margin expansion. Total revenues grew 26%, while organic revenue growth of 15% was led by double-digit growth in the U.S. and Western Europe and high single-digit growth in emerging markets. Each business exceeded our expectations, and we saw double-digit growth in all segments and end markets. Utilities was up 17% due to robust demand and price realization in both M&amp;CS and Water Infrastructure. Industrial grew 11% on strong price realization and demand across all regions. And lastly, building solutions, which includes commercial and residential grew 15%. Overall, demand remains resilient as demonstrated by our $5.3 billion backlog, up 7% organically, as Patrick highlighted, and now includes Evoqua. And while orders were down 2% on the quarter, book-to-bill continues to be above 1. EBITDA margin was 19.1%, up 250 basis points from the prior year on higher volumes, productivity savings and favorable price cost dynamics. Excluding the impact of Evoqua, EBITDA margin was up 200 basis points, exceeding our previous expectations. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.98, up 32% year-over-year and up 28% excluding the impact of acquisitions. Please turn to Slide 7, and I'll review each segment's second quarter performance in a bit more detail. M&amp;CS revenue was up 21%, driven by improved chip supply as well as strong demand in pipeline assessment services. U.S. and Western Europe saw robust growth, and we continue to see favorable momentum in emerging markets. Orders grew 6% with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 and our backlog of $2.4 billion is up 17% versus the prior year, demonstrating continued strong demand for our AMI offerings. EBITDA margin for the segment was up 590 basis points versus the prior year on strong incrementals. Volume conversion, price realization and productivity drove the expansion, more than offsetting inflation and unfavorable mix. And now let's turn to Slide 8, and I'll cover our Water Infrastructure business. Water Infrastructure, which now includes Evoqua's Applied Product Technologies segment grew 20% on a reported basis and 13% organically. Growth was robust across the portfolio, with revenues up double digits in all end markets and applications. Developed markets saw particularly strong growth driven by OpEx demand, while emerging markets grew 7%, driven by Latin America and Asia Pacific. Orders in the quarter were down 4% year-over-year, lapping prior year growth of over 20%, and book-to-bill was above 1. EBITDA margin for the segment was roughly flat year-over-year and up 20 basis points when excluding the contribution of Evoqua. Please turn to Slide 9 for an overview of Applied Water. Applied Water revenues grew 12% on continued strong price realization and backlog execution. The U.S. and emerging markets grew double digits, while Western Europe grew mid-single digits. Industrial demand was both resilient in both Western Europe and emerging markets, particularly due to recovery in China. And while orders were down 6% in the quarter, our backlog continues to be elevated versus historical levels, and book-to-bill is 0.9. Segment EBITDA margin was up 290 basis points in the quarter with continued strong price realization, coupled with productivity more than offsetting inflation. Please turn to Slide 10. I'm very pleased to introduce Integrated Solutions &amp; Services as our newest reporting segment. ISS is a leading North American water treatment solution and services provider that brings access to a durable and highly recurring revenue stream as well as a diverse and attractive industrial verticals. With approximately 75% recurring revenue, ISS is known for dependability and bringing mission-critical water treatment expertise to our customers. Although we only reported ISS after our May 24 close, full quarter revenue was up 12%, driven by strong price realization and backlog execution. And orders grew 4% with a book-to-bill ratio above 1 due to broad-based demand across industrials and utilities. Backlog of nearly $1 billion to end the quarter, was up 15% year-over-year. And adjusted EBITDA margin post close was a solid at 24%. And now let's turn to Slide 11 for an overview of cash flows and the company's financial position. After retiring over $600 million of debt in conjunction with the closing of Evoqua, our financial position remains robust as we exit the quarter with over $700 million in cash and available liquidity of $1.6 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is 1.4x and in the second quarter, we had solid adjusted free cash flow conversion of 86%. Please turn to Slide 12, and I'll hand it back over to Patrick.Patrick K. DeckerThanks, Sandy. Just a little more than 2 months post close, our excitement about the Evoqua acquisition has only grown. We've made great progress in 3 areas. First is our performance and outlook as the business stands today. We began the integration with an overarching principle, and that was to deliver continuity for our customers, keep our commitments and not disrupt business performance. The results tell a clear story of focused near-term delivery. The combination of our team's disciplined execution and healthy underlying market demand has given us the confidence to raise our full year guide. But our current performance is, as you would expect, largely a reflection of our businesses as they are. What we're most excited about is our future potential and the opportunities ahead of us, which brings me to the second dimension on which our confidence is only growing. When the transaction closed, we announced a combined leadership team. And frankly, I'm energized by the strong cultural fit the team has already been demonstrating and the early momentum we've created. We are well on track to deliver the cost synergies outlined when we announced the transaction. And as we progress through the integration, we have even more greater visibility of the operating efficiencies to be realized in coming quarters, along with the opportunity for significant further margin expansion. At the same time, the whole strategic rationale of this combination has always been about further accelerating our profitable growth. And that's the third dimension I referred to in my opening comments. We are now even more strongly positioned in attractive, durable end markets with a significant component of recurring revenue streams. Now that we have deeper insight into the intersection of our businesses and customers, we see those opportunities even more clearly. So moving on to Slide 13. This is the right combination at the right time. Together, we have the strongest platform of capabilities to address customers' critical water challenges. Those needs are increasing, and we have the scale and reach now to deliver differentiated solutions globally. Our teams are already detailing how we will do that. First, in utilities, we will deepen our penetration, especially with the addition of Evoqua's Applied Product Technologies to our Water Infrastructure offerings. In industrial, we'll use the power of our combined offering to scale our presence in attractive industrial end markets. And then we will expand our Services Solutions business by leveraging Xylem's well-established global distribution platform. Now as many of you know, this combination delivers on part of the strategy we laid out back in our 2021 Investor Day, and that was to expand our capability and our presence in industrial end markets. Increasing industrial exposure reinforces the durability of our overall business model and gains us greater access to attractive customer sets for even faster long-term growth. The recurring revenues of ISS, which deliver consistent performance throughout economic cycles, it complements our M&amp;CS and Water Infrastructure businesses, which also benefit from the resilience of utility spending. We've already taken the first steps in offering our combined portfolio to light and general industry customers and we're already targeting attractive industrial verticals such as life sciences and microelectronics. Both have strong long-term outlooks that are driven by secular trends that align well with Xylem's existing business. We look forward to keeping you up to date with our integration progress on a regular basis and anticipate providing a longer-term growth outlook at an Investor Day likely to be scheduled in the first part of 2024. Now with that, I'm going to hand it over to Matthew to say a bit more about our end market outlook.Matthew Francis PineThank you, Patrick. Turning to Slide 14. Before I cover our end market outlook for the year, I want to thank the team and our partners for a great quarter. Our continued outperformance and momentum give us confidence to deliver in 2023 and beyond. We have record backlogs and the value proposition of our differentiated portfolio in attractive end markets puts us in a strong position even in a potentially dynamic macroeconomic environment. We continue to take a balanced approach in our outlook and are monitoring leading indicators watching for signs of moderation. That said, we expect resilient demand in utilities and continued steady growth in industrial water applications. And now I'll turn to our 2023 outlook by end market, which will be on an organic basis. Utilities, which is approximately 45% of our revenue continue to be healthy and we now expect growth of mid-teens, up from low teens. On the clean water side, we anticipate growth of low 20s, up from high teens previously due to robust demand for our AMI solutions, and backlog execution on improved chip supply. In addition, we are seeing great traction on solution selling with our digital platform and customers are increasingly interested in bundling offerings. On the wastewater side, we continue to expect high single-digit growth, resilient OpEx in developed markets as well as continued CapEx spend in emerging markets will underpin demand. Turning now to the industrial end market, which is 45% of our revenue, we expect steady global growth of mid-single digits, but are keeping a close watch for signs of moderation. We expect any softness from developed markets to be somewhat offset by growth in emerging markets including China, where industrial momentum has continued to outpace utilities. Lastly, in building solutions, which is about 10% of our revenue, we expect growth of mid-single digits, driven by steady replacement business and backlog execution. The overall demand outlook remains healthy. And although we are not including Evoqua in our organic outlook, we expect the contribution of mission-critical solutions and services in attractive high-growth verticals such as life sciences and microelectronics to further increase the durability of our business. That outlook, combined with our operating discipline, commercial momentum and large backlogs gives us confidence for the rest of the year and beyond. Now I'll turn it over to Sandy to walk you through the detail of our raised guidance.Sandra E. RowlandThank you, Matthew. Turning to Slide 15. We are increasing our full year guidance across revenue, EBITDA and EPS and also incorporating Evoqua. I want to take a moment to walk you through the puts and takes of how we now see the full year. We expect total revenues to be around $7.2 billion for the year, which includes approximately $1.1 billion from Evoqua and another increase in our organic revenue guidance. We now expect full year organic revenue growth of 9% to 10%, up from 8% to 9%. We are raising the low end of our EBITDA guidance to about 18%. And in addition, we are lifting full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.50 to $3.70, up approximately $0.35 at the midpoint. This incorporates a $0.15 raise from our strong organic outlook and a $0.20 increase due to acquisition-related adjustments. This includes a contribution from Evoqua of approximately $0.45 and the add back of legacy purchase accounting intangible amortization of $0.30 and partially offset by incremental share dilution of about $0.55. As Patrick highlighted, we've made great progress on integration. We expect to be at $40 million of run rate cost synergies by the end of the year and we remain on track to deliver $140 million of run rate cost synergies within 3 years. Turning to Slide 16. For 2023, our organic revenue growth by segment breaks down as follows: approximately 20% growth in M&amp;CS, high single-digits growth in Water Infrastructure and mid-single-digit growth in Applied Water and we are still on track to achieve free cash flow conversion of at least 100% of net income. We've also provided you with a number of other full year assumptions in the appendix on Slide 21. And now drilling down in the third quarter, we anticipate total company growth will be in the range of 40% to 45% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. By segment, we expect revenue growth to be in the high teens in M&amp;CS and mid-single digits in Water Infrastructure and remained flat in Applied Water. We expect third quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 18%, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization and productivity gains. And with that, please turn to Slide 17, and I'll turn the call back over to Patrick for closing comments.Patrick K. DeckerThanks, Sandy. We've covered a lot here. So we look forward to your questions. But just before we do that, I want to reiterate a fundamental point. This is a transformational step forward for Xylem, and we believe it is transformational for our customers and our communities. We are very excited about this strategic evolution, but the most important things about Xylem are not changing. Our investment thesis is one of those unchanging constants. We are creating significant economic and social value with a durable business model that addresses intensifying water challenges. And we're doing that with a differentiated portfolio of solutions and services in attractive and growing end markets. This gives us a multiyear runway of profitable growth with sustainable margin expansion on the foundations of a strong balance sheet and cash generation with capital deployment to further strengthen our portfolio. It has become increasingly apparent that the need for solutions to the world's water challenges is only growing, and we are in a very privileged position to serve those needs. So now we look forward to taking your questions. So operator, let me turn the call back over to you for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.Deane Michael DrayJust a comment to start, and we really appreciate all the heavy lifting that went on, all these moving parts, recasting financials, the re-segmentation, the new end market mix and the move to cash EPS. And look, from our perspective, that all makes sense, but we appreciate all the work that...Patrick K. DeckerDeane, before your question, I just want to -- I do want to give a shout out to the entire team here and around the world that have been a part of not just closing this transaction, but all the moving parts and pieces that you talked about. In the midst of exciting momentum, a lot of work, and we really appreciate that recognition.Deane Michael DrayYes. That's exactly what I was doing. And just the fact you did not skip a beat on the organic side of the business. Cash conversion, order intake and so forth. So that was the comment part. And now I go to my question. On the re-segmentation, ISS is a stand-alone check the box. That's what we'd expect you to do. And then combining APT with Water Infrastructure that also makes sense because that's where there's some interesting overlap in terms of go-to-market, customer, not so much on the technologies, but on the go-to-market side. So first question, because that is where there's some integration that will be going on. So give us a sense of what that integration effort is on combining those businesses and anything about the cost synergies and any conceptual thoughts on revenue synergies?Patrick K. DeckerYes. Thanks, Deane. So I'm going to hand it to Matthew to comment on your specific question. I would say that the integration efforts are really off to a great start. And APT, that part of Evoqua is a clear and obvious opportunity for us, and I've been really pleased and impressed by the cultural assimilation of the teams. But with that, I'll let Matthew comment a bit more on why that integration, why now and what that kind of looks like for us.Matthew Francis PineThanks, Patrick. Deane, first of all, as Sandy mentioned a few minutes ago in her remarks, they're very complementary businesses, first and foremost. And there is immediate synergies, both on the revenue and the cost side. So that's getting us out of the gate fast. The teams are making great progress, as Patrick mentioned. It allows us to quickly cross-sell our products, both in industrial and utilities. And an example of this would be in the utility space, being able to bundle our solutions and kind of walk through the front door with a total solution across the whole treatment train, if you will, from beginning to end. We didn't have that capability before. Bringing the 2 companies together enables us to bring that full offering to the table. Also, something that maybe is not as intuitive is our technicians, what we call AQUApros, are out with our customers. Now they have a broader portfolio to solve customer pain points. And we're already seeing that play out just organically with our technicians recommending other -- recommending new products in the portfolio very quickly. So that may be something that's not as intuitive, but it's happening already. I'd say thirdly, I'd say the R&amp;D synergies. There's obviously R&amp;D synergies when we bring the treatment businesses together. And then lastly, we -- Patrick mentioned leadership in the very beginning. We brought over 3 leaders to the senior leadership team from Evoqua. Hervé Fages will lead the combined treatment business. He has tremendous experience here and bringing those 2 pieces together will be instrumental for our out-of-the-gate performance on cost and revenue.Deane Michael DrayThat's all really good to hear. And so second question is, the theme is digital. And first, just give us an update on the chip supply. Does it continue to be a gradual supply improvement there? And what's the outlook and then related to that is, Patrick, there's been this digital path for Xylem, where you were targeting a 50% of revenues by 2025. And I know it's still early, and I'm not asking a real specific number here, but just conceptually, how -- and our view is Evoqua is significantly on the path of digital themselves. So now combined, that should help you towards this goal. So just chip supply and then conceptually, where are you on the path on half of digital revenues by what timeframe?Patrick K. DeckerI'll let Matthew start on where we are on chip supply and then he and I will tag team on where we are in digital.Matthew Francis PineGreat. Chip supply, Deane, as you mentioned, is continuing to the moderate improvement as we expected. Q3 will look a lot like Q2. We do expect a pickup in Q4 and also as we head into 2024, we do expect chip supply to improve, but also our redesigns will be coming online as we head into the really the end of 2023 into 2024. So that gives us confidence that we'll see that ramp Q4 and then into '24. Maybe just a few comments on digital and then Patrick can wrap it up. We are making good progress towards the 50% of revenues digital goal. That was a legacy Xylem target. We can see it in the backlog. We have a lot of digital content that's trapped in the backlog. And that will start to release as we get better chip supply and we get better, just in general electronic supply over the course of the next 6 to 12 months. The continued adoption of AMI, as you see in the backlog increase this quarter with M&amp;CS, we're up $300 million. So making significant progress on digital, especially buoyed by AMI. And then I'd say, lastly, the partnership with Idrica is really important because it enables us to pull through more digital content. We're already starting to see that play out. So I'd say, all in all, we're in a good trajectory, and we're making good progress.Patrick K. DeckerYes. And I just -- I would wrap that up, Deane, with -- first of all, great question because it's a key underpinning of our overall story and differentiation in the marketplace, which is I know why you raised the question. So high confidence in both the heritage kind of Xylem business. I would say what I'm most encouraged by there also is we continue to see really exciting adoption on AMI in the marketplace, which really is borne out by the print in our increased backlog and deal wins. With Evoqua, the opportunity there, it really is more of a complementary strategy on digital. In the Evoqua businesses, we're really talking about the ISS business. The digital path that the team there has been on is really more around how do you use digital and connectivity to actually improve the productivity of the services offering making it easier for AQUApros to do their jobs. That leads to margin enhancement. That's a big opportunity within the ISS portfolio to improve our EBITDA margins by, again, digitally enabling kind of what they do every day, making less truck rolls, less visits to serve the customer, give the customer more data insights, predict where the issues are, before they have to go out and find them. So there's a whole exciting area there that for those that are new to either the Xylem or the Evoqua story, we'll have more to share on that at our Investor Day going forward. It's very exciting.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Mike Halloran with Baird.Michael Patrick HalloranSo the first question, I think, is a relatively straightforward question, but I just want to level set everything, given how many moving pieces here that there are. So it sounds like guidance was raised both organically as well as your expectations that have moved higher on the Evoqua piece if we compare this to, call it, 2, 3 months ago, whenever you last gave an update. Can you just talk through the pieces of why that those expectations have moved higher? I know some of it is the second quarter outlook, but it feels like that it's a little broader than that. So can you just maybe line out those moving pieces for us?Sandra E. RowlandYes. Let me take a crack at that, Mike. If you rewind back to February, we -- if you look at where -- compared to our initial guide, organically, we're now forecasting about $300 million higher revenue. We did raise our guidance the last time we spoke and this quarter we raised it by another $75 million. In M&amp;CS, we started the year thinking that the business would grow somewhere in the low teens. We now are expecting 20% growth in that segment. And we're seeing very good strong incremental margins come from that business. So it's a combination of metrology. It's also a combination of the other businesses that we wrap around metrology and M&amp;CS that's giving us good upside. And then the other 2 businesses, they've been performing really well. They've gotten ahead of the curve from a price cost perspective we sustain that momentum. But I think what's also encouraging is we're seeing significant -- we're seeing more increases on the volume side as well. And so it's really all parts of our portfolio that are contributing to the beat and raise. When I look at the Evoqua side of the house, we talked about them contributing about $1.1 billion this year. This past quarter, we brought in about $175 million of revenue from Evoqua. Margins there are developing really nicely and if you look at our implied outlook for the rest of the year, there -- the margins for both companies are really right on top of each other. So it's really good to see strong momentum from both sides of the house. And I think it goes back to the deal operating principles where we've kept both teams really focused on delivering on the organic plan.Michael Patrick HalloranGreat. No, that's exactly what I was looking for. Appreciate that. And then second question, maybe you could just talk a little bit about the momentum you're seeing on the utility side as we work through next year. Book-to-bill seems pretty good on the utility pieces. Obviously, M&amp;CS is healthy. I think the infrastructure piece is healthy, though, obviously, you got some industrial in there. Backlog is very high on the M&amp;CS side. Maybe just talk about the visibility you have on those pieces in the next year, wrapping ISS into that a little bit as well, and talk about how you're looking at the contribution from some of these regulatory drivers coming out of some of the funding that might or might not get released here?Patrick K. DeckerYes. So I'll start, Mike, and then I'll hand it over to Matthew. Just to your question, zooming out around utilities, we remain, I would say, more confident than ever around where utilities -- again, this is a global statement where utilities are in the cycle. One, we see here in the U.S. that while we're still early in the adoption of AMI, we continue to see an increased excitement around that. And that shows up in our bidding pipeline. It shows up in our deal wins. It shows up in our backlog. And I think the numbers speak for themselves there on where AMI adoption is going and our ability to successfully compete and win in that space of the market. Secondly, the -- there are the underlying fundamentals of -- the largest part of utility spend, as you well know, is OpEx, it's repair replace. And given the age of infrastructure around the world, most notably here in North America but also in Europe. We see continued increases in that demand and outlook. And that's going to continue as a long-term trend. I think in terms of other demand profiles beyond that, as we think about whether it be the Inflation Reduction Act, other infrastructure legislation here in the U.S. We get a lot of questions around PFAS and obviously, with our Evoqua capabilities coming in, that's obviously a very exciting area for us. But as we've said before, and I know Ron, the CEO of Evoqua in the past has said, that's a dimmer switch. It's not like all of a sudden one day it's going to show up. It's going to be adoption over time. And it just reinforces the positive tailwind that we believe we have in the areas that we're focusing on at Xylem. So that's my commentary around utilities. I don't know, Matthew, if you want to add anything to that.Matthew Francis PineI think the only thing I would add to that, we have really close relationship with our customers, especially our utility customers. And based on conversations that we've had with them over the past few months, we don't see a reason that there's going to be any slowdown. The draft muni budgets for the next year for some of our [bowl] weather utilities are showing growth year-over-year. So I'd say kind of -- that's kind of customer back, the feedback we're getting. Obviously, we play very globally in utilities, not only in the U.S. but half of our revenue is outside the U.S. And to Patrick's point, there's a lot of public funding globally both in the U.K. with the AMP cycle. In China, the EU and then obviously, in the U.S. So feels pretty good.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen.Joseph Craig GiordanoCan you talk through like kind of how the quarter went in Western Europe and China? I mean that's where the debt has been kind of squishy and maybe getting work there a little bit. And I'm just curious on your thoughts on potential for Chinese stimulus and where that might get directed if it does impact you guys?Matthew Francis PineYes. Joe, it's Matthew. Just maybe just some comments on Europe. It continues to be resilient, especially in utilities, which is over 50% of our revenue in Europe. With the majority of that being in OpEx, as Patrick just mentioned earlier. We were up low teens in orders in Europe in utilities. And so that was really good news. The softness that we're seeing is more on the building solutions side, which is partially offset by industrial. All in all, Western Europe is up low single digits in orders. So I'd say, all in all, faring pretty well there when you take the balance there in account. China, which makes up around 6% of our revenues, we saw positive momentum both in orders and revenue in Q2. We were up 20% plus, which although it was an easier compare, it was really great work done by Shuping Lu, who leads our team there and the entire team in China. Just incredible resolve and just really in China for China, localizing products and shifting where some of the slowness is happening and getting into more of the high-growth areas. Industrial has led the way in China for us, and we're starting to see a little bit of momentum in the utility space. And obviously, in the commercial building space in China, that's where the weakness is, but it's not a big part of our business in China. 75% of our business in China is more utility centric. So all in all, we're very confident in China, and we -- in the long-term outlook, given really the critical nature and focus on water in country there.Patrick K. DeckerAnd Joe, you know this already, but for the rest of the listeners, I've been a long-term bull on China just because of the underlying demands and needs from a water and environmental standpoint there continues to be a top policy mandate of the government. You couple that with the strength of our team and our portfolio of offerings. We've weathered a couple of cycles in China over the time that I've been here. But when you go back and look over the last 7 or so years, it's like a double-digit CAGR of growth, and we continue to see that potential going forward. So I'm very proud of the team and optimistic about China for us.Joseph Craig GiordanoThat's good color. And then just I wanted to follow up on Idrica. Just -- where is that in terms of like what needs to happen for that to become kind of like a core kind of beachhead for you and digitalization on a scale basis? And then, Sandy, I just had one clarification for you. APT within Water Infrastructure. Just curious how that looked organically on like a full quarter basis for revenue and orders?Sandra E. RowlandYes, let me knock that out of the way and then Matthew can take Idrica. When you look at the performance of the full quarter of Evoqua, the business grew 9% organically and the APT piece of Evoqua grew 4%.Matthew Francis PineGreat. Yes. In terms of Idrica, just for folks that are on the phone that may not know what Idrica is, it's -- we have an exclusive commercial partnership worldwide with Idrica, which is headquartered in Valencia, Spain. They were born out of the utility operator and the digital platform that they have that we're partnered with, addresses really the biggest pain point we hear from utilities, need for a singular platform to seamlessly integrate all of their applications and data. And I would say we have built really good momentum over the past 4 to 5 months. We've engaged over 200-plus utilities globally, and it's got really global reach, it's fairly balanced across the globe and have built a solid funnel with really significant synergy wins through bundling our solutions. So I would say it is becoming the beachhead. It will become the beachhead and earlier in Deane's question, is going to help us pull through and drive more digital content and also reoccurring revenue, which is really important. Just one example I'll give you in the U.S. recently where we leveraged this digital platform, we're calling the Xylem View which is the Idrica platform. We pulled through a large AMI order. Now you're seeing in the backlog. So you saw the backlog grow by $300 million. One of those big synergy wins was due to the digital platform that we enabled and pull through this synergy order. So it's going to help us with recurring revenue, but it's also going to pull through content, which is really strong.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Nathan Jones with Stifel.Nathan Hardie JonesI'm going to start on the cost synergy side. Pretty good run rate to be at $40 million by the end of the year, like 30% of the targeted cost synergy number. So maybe you could just start off by talking about where that's coming from to hit that kind of run rate that quickly in this kind of deal, the major buckets for the $140 million? And then if you can give us any color on how we should think about those layering in, in '24, '25, '26?Sandra E. RowlandYes. Sure, Nate. Let me kick that off. I think the cost synergy buckets that we outlined when we announced the transaction have not changed. So the first category was to go after a public company costs, overlapping public company costs as well as some of the SG&amp;A savings. And so that is making up the lion's share of the savings that we're going to realize in 2023. And the other 2 categories of savings, which are going to come from procurement savings as well as some site consolidations and manufacturing footprint overlap, we expect the procurement savings to start to kick in later in '24. And the manufacturing site consolidations, that's going to happen over time. We have those phased because we want to make sure we're purposely taking care of our customers. So about $40 million exit rate in Q4 as I look into '24, we'll be more than double that when we exit '24. So I think all signs, we're very confident about the $140 million.Nathan Hardie JonesAnd I did want to ask a couple of questions or one probably long question about revenue synergies. It's obviously a big motivating factor for this deal to get done in the first place. Not looking for exact numbers. (inaudible), more of those in early '24. But if you can just talk conceptually about areas where you see potential for revenue synergies and kind of the phasing of those. I mean, there's obviously the APT and Water Infrastructure combination, I think, certainly signals that there's revenue synergies there, and you talked about them before. But maybe talking about things like expanding Evoqua's service-based business model internationally, maybe leveraging their footprint in the U.S. to develop some more service-based business models with Xylem's legacy products? And then any other channels you'd be willing to talk about to help us understand the opportunity here?Patrick K. DeckerSure. So Nate, this is Patrick. So I go back to the 3 overarching kind of areas that we're focused on. And what I would offer is we've also got special incentives in place for our teams to go capture the revenue synergy because we want people to be highly motivated to go do these things beyond their day job. So deep in our utility penetration. And that really is around, again, combination of our treatment product portfolio of the 2 companies. They really do complement each other very, very well and leveraging what Xylem's really market-leading utility position is around the world. These are not North America comments alone, they're around the world, is a big opportunity. Secondly, scaling our offering to industrial customers. Again, we call them industrial, and there's a number of customer sets that are in that area that we think there are big opportunities. We don't think we see big opportunities to really go solve their needs. So if you think about -- well, the third is expanding the ISS offering internationally. And 2 and 3 have a lot in common because as part of our diligence when we looked at Evoqua, they have a really, really impressive roster of customers market-leading customers that cut across areas of whether it be power, whether it be food and beverage, whether it be life science, whether -- again, whether it be microelectronics that have needed even more Evoqua's capability than Evoqua has been able to provide in the past, especially international. And that's where we, as Xylem, have the footprint and we had the scale and the resources to be able to drive that adoption.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Joe Giordano with Jefferies.Sandra E. RowlandOperator, I think we've heard from him.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.Saree Emily BoroditskyMaybe digging into building solutions a little bit. Commercial demand has continued to be strong. I think this is one area that you're anticipating a slowdown previously. So maybe just an update on what you're seeing there.Sandra E. RowlandYes. I mean -- I'm sorry, so it was a little bit choppy, you asked about commercial? Yes. So our commercial business has been pretty resilient this year. We've seen -- continue to see strong revenue growth. And our outlook for the back of the year is -- we still are going in with an elevated backlog. So nothing has changed materially there.Patrick K. DeckerSaree you were a bit choppy and breaking. I want to make sure we clarify your question in terms of which segment.Saree Emily BoroditskyYes. I think you're anticipating a slowdown previously. I think said maybe [AMI]. Just trying to get an update there on building solutions. And then maybe just on -- just following that up on residential, obviously, small market for you guys, but how did that trend through the quarter? And are you seeing any positive signs there?Sandra E. RowlandYes. Saree, I mean, I think when you look across the portfolio, we're seeing really good orders momentum and strong book-to-bill. The one soft spot in our portfolio is residential. And before the acquisition, that made up about 5% of our revenue base. Now it's even lower than that. It's 2% or 3% of our revenue base. So yes, that is the weakest part of our portfolio. You're seeing a slower growth outlook in AWS for the second half of the year, offset by the other businesses that have more resilient end markets such as utilities.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.Andrew Alec KaplowitzSo Patrick, dewatering has obviously remained strong for you guys. We talked about it in the past being a little more cyclical, but it seems like it's sort of holding up well. So maybe you can talk about sort of what you see going forward, maybe even into '24 in that business.Patrick K. DeckerYes. So dewatering had historically, for those that may be relatively new to the story of Xylem, had historically been one of our more cyclical businesses. And because it's such a high-margin business, it would tend to capture spotlight even with a little bit of movement in terms of downturn. And there have been a number of moves that we've made over the past handful of years to diversify the end market exposure of that. I'll hand it over to Matthew to kind of give his take on kind of where we are positioned right now. But I'm certainly proud of the work the team has done. And there's been a lot of work done on synergy, commercial integration even before the acquisition of Evoqua and I know it's like stronger now.Matthew Francis PineYes. No, it's great, Patrick. We've put a lot of time and effort into dewatering over the past couple of years, Andy. And I would say maybe a couple of things. One is we invested in the fleet, both in Europe and in the U.S., which has really helped us capture more wins. Number two, really coming out of 2019, we needed to diversify our segments in dewatering. We were too oil and gas dependent. And we've done a nice job of mixing into light construction as well as into mini bypass and some different areas that are a bit more profitable and a bit more steady and less cyclical. So those are a couple of key drivers, I would say that's really helped us. And the last thing I would say in the U.S. where predominantly our revenue is, we've done a good job of driving the businesses together and driving synergies with our service organizations, passing leads back and forth to one another, with our pipeline assessment service businesses, our valve maintenance business and whatnot. So really good on the synergy side that's helped drive growth as well.Patrick K. DeckerI would just wrap up that answer by saying, I think in this business, like the entire business but certainly in this area, it's about leadership. We've got a strong leadership team in that area that are working together. They're leveraging the portfolio. They're focusing on what happens at a slight kind of local service level. This, just like our ISS business coming in, it's people, very people-driven business. It's an emergency room kind of operation. it's what happens every day, 24/7. And so the hearts and minds of the people really, really matter here. They do everywhere, but they really matter here in terms of what customers experience in the moment. And again, I just give -- I give an applause to leadership team for what they've done.Andrew Alec KaplowitzVery helpful, guys. And I apologize, I joined the call a little late, so if this has been asked, but like on price versus cost, maybe talk about sort of -- you already talked about supply chain getting better, I think, but sort of what you're seeing on the pricing side versus that sort of improving supply chain? And then maybe looking at Evoqua too, any sort of differences in markets as you're thinking about price versus cost as you go to the second half of this year and into '24.Sandra E. RowlandYes. Thanks for the question, Andy. We've seen really nice development on the price cost side, and it continues -- the way we've managed it, it's now been a tailwind for us from a margin perspective. We are starting to anniversary some of the price increases that we took when inflation was peaking. And so you're not going to see as much of a tailwind from price in the back half of the year that you saw in the front half. The positive thing is that this is actually the first quarter that we've seen inflation start to moderate and come through our results. And we would expect to see a little more of that as well in the back half of the year. So really great work by the commercial teams to make that happen over the past year.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.Brian K. LeeA question on the M&amp;CS margins. Kudos on super solid execution there. I don't think we've seen margins at these levels since I think right after you bought Sensus, so it's been a while. So just trying to get a better sense of what drove that, how sustainable it is? And then what we maybe should be thinking of run rates through year-end. And if you think this is a good sort of jumping off point for potentially getting back to a double-digit margin on a full year basis next year. Is that a reasonable sort of target to have at this point?Matthew Francis PineYes. Thanks for the question. I'll start us out and then turn it over to Sandy. But we've spent a lot of time in the past 6 to 12 months, really, the past 12 months on M&amp;CS margins. And I'd say there's probably 2 or 3 things I would point to. Number one, obviously, we were hampered by chip supply, not being able to unlock the backlog. And so being able to unlock the backlog is really helped with absorption in our factories and helping cover fixed costs. So that's probably number one. Number two is we're getting back to productivity in that business. We had to redeploy resources to go after redesign our products for chips. And so productivity has increased this year year-over-year, and we'll continue to drive that in the business. And then thirdly, I would just say, in general, price cost has been a very good positive over the past 2 to 3 quarters in M&amp;CS, which has helped buoy margins as well. So we'll continue that pace going forward and expect margin improvement sequentially going forward.Patrick K. DeckerAnd Brian, this is Patrick. I would just offer up some historical perspective here for those that may be early on in the story here. M&amp;CS is not a turnaround. We -- I mean, this has been an issue in terms of being able to deliver on what has been an impressively growing backlog over the course of the past few years. And we've had margin read-through on what that backlog is for a long time. We've made commitments in the past as to when we reach certain levels of revenue, what the margins would be, that's exactly what you're seeing right now. So again, I give a shout out to the entire team that drives, especially the metrology part of our business because they've been executing on this ever since we did the acquisition. It's just -- it's always been something along the way. And now we're seeing that the clouds have kind of moved off the horizon and you're now seeing what the full potential or at least the next stage of potential is for this part of our business.Brian K. LeeOkay. That's great. I appreciate that color. And then maybe just a second question around -- with the acquisition of Evoqua, clearly much bigger scale, but much more diversification across the business model. It seems like it'd be a lot less cyclical going forward. In the past, I know Evoqua has sort of broken out what the sort of their recurring revenue exposure is as a part of their portfolio or sales mix. Now on the combined entity, any sense you can give us as to how you think about the recurring revenue nature of the different segments where you have exposure there and kind of how that compares to Xylem stand-alone?Patrick K. DeckerYes. No, certainly, great question, Brian. I mean it was certainly not the reason for the acquisition, but certainly, one of the big benefits is that recurring revenue component. The Evoqua business, we have tremendous line of sight going into any given year based upon contractual commitments as to what that looks like. And so you're talking about the largest portion of their revenue is predictable and repeatable going into the year. And so -- and that really is ISS, which is obviously the largest part of what we got from Evoqua. If you look at the other parts of our business, historically, our M&amp;CS business, which is metrology, also has a lot of revenue under contract. And so a majority of revenue there is visible going into the year, but not even one year. It's looking at it over the course of a 10- to 12-year time frame, given AMI deals that are there. Water Infrastructure would be the next one, given the fact that we've got such a large installed base of our particularly submersible wastewater pumps, but also our treatment products that we do that are typically long-term kind of projects that we're operating under. And it's just a very stable repair replacement environment. We feel very good about that. The area -- the business that's always been shorter cycle for us is our Applied Water business. But even there, we would say upwards of 1/3 to 40% of our revenue, while it's not under contract, it's a replacement model. And once you've spec your pumps into a commercial building, or an industrial application, the likelihood of a customer changing out to a new supplier is very low. It's very sticky, and we have market-leading positions there. So even though it's not contractual, we can kind of have that visibility going into the year. So we will -- in the future, we'll give you specific numbers in the aggregate. I don't want to overcommit to that right now, but we feel very good about the durability and nature of recurring revenue of this business much more now than we did a quarter ago because of bringing in Evoqua.OperatorThis concludes the Q&amp;A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the floor over to Patrick Decker for closing remarks.Patrick K. DeckerWell, again, I mean, thanks to all of you for your time this morning and for your ongoing support. I look forward to seeing many of you over the coming months here before our next call. And just a reminder, lastly, again, really excited today about the power of the combination of 2 companies coming together that were strong on their own and performing well. And now is the time. It's the right time in this world for these 2 companies to come together because there are so many great water challenges out there to be dealt with, and we feel that we are in a position to really be a meaningful part of that.

44,f2288ff6-5700-31dd-8761-b7236e81e842,XYL,2023-08-03,3 Clean Water Stocks to Diversify Your Green Portfolio,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-clean-water-stocks-diversify-144916235.html,1690469356,STORY,"['PNR', 'XYL', 'CWCO']","[Wind and solar will continue to get the lion’s share of the headlines as it relates to the world’s clean energy transition. However, it may also be time for investors to consider investing in clean water stocks as part of a balanced clean energy portfolio.  Concerns about water quality will drive the growth in clean water stocks. You may not remember the exact number from your school days, but 70% of the earth’s surface is covered in water. Supply is not the primary issue.  That issue would be quality. Only about 1% of the world’s water is immediately available to be consumed by humans. Therefore, water treatment will remain a major growth driver for water stocks. This generally takes the form of water purification and water monitoring.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAlso, there are opportunities as work is done to repair an aging water infrastructure. The 2021 Infrastructurd Bill passed by the United States Congress includes $55 billion for upgrading the nation’s water infrastructure.  Fortunately, investors have several options to choose from when searching for clean water stocks. Here are three choices that give investors the ability to fill out a clean energy portfolio.  Consolidated Water (CWCO) A photo of small bubbles in a container of water.Source: khak/ShutterStock.comIf you have an appetite for small-cap stocks, Consolidated Water (NASDAQ:CWCO) is one to put on your radar. The company is addressing the need for both water treatment and desalination. Both markets are expected to show a strong compound annual growth rate (CAGR) throughout the next five years.  The California-based company does busines in a variety of international markets. In the U.S., its primary market is in the southwest. Not surprisingly, this is an area where water scarcity is a growing concern.  Consolidated Water has a strong balance sheet, and is showing strong revenue growth. In its first quarter 2023 earnings report, the company posted a 68% year-over-year increase in revenue. However, that’s not translating into earnings growth at this time. The company is consistently profitable, but it expects to post a slight year-over-year decline in earnings. Still, analysts project the stock to grow by approximately 20% this year.  Story continuesPentair (PNR) In this photo illustration the Pentair (PNR) logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comPentair (NYSE:PNR) is next on this list of clean water stocks. The company develops solutions for water filtration that also address the need for sustainability. The company launched its Pentair Rocean Reservoir home water filtration system. In addition to reducing or removing 76 contaminants, this will help address the pollution problem that plastic water bottles present.  The company is still largely known for its pool equipment business. That was responsible for the company’s strong revenue growth in 2021. In 2023, Pentair faces tough comparisons, but revenue is holding up so far.  PNR stock may present investors with an interesting discrepancy. Specifically, the company’s earnings are projected to grow by 10% this year and it has a fair valuation with a forward P/E ratio of just 18x.  Normally earnings growth precedes stock price growth. However, analysts are forecasting the PNR stock price to fall by 3%. Even if the stock price growth doesn’t materialize right away, you get a sustainable dividend that has been increasing for 48 consecutive years, and comes with a 29% payout ratio.  Xylem (XYL) xylem appSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAs I mentioned in the introduction, the world’s water infrastructure is in desperate need of an overhaul. A leading research firm sets that this maintenance will continue to grow at a rate of 10% every year. That’s where Xylem (NYSE:XYL) comes into play.  Xylem is a water technology company that makes products to help maintain equipment at wastewater treatment plants. One of the common problems the company addresses is leaky pipes. This is important because the average water main in the U.S. may be up to 50 years old. That being said, the company’s business isn’t limited to the U.S.In fact, it does business in more than 150 countries.  Of the clean water stocks on this list, Xylem is the one with the highest valuation. It’s trading at 33 times forward earnings. Still, the company is projected to have yearly earnings growth of 10%, and analysts are only projecting a 3% increase in the XYL stock price.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The reason for the move is the same as it was a dozen years ago: Congress is kicking the can on increasing its debt ceiling, which, if not raised, would cause the U.S. to default on its debts. Last time, it was also a Democratic White House and a Republican-led House of Representatives that saw this issue emerge.In any case, market indices were down across the board today. All the majors opened normal trading in the red and stayed there, closing off session lows, but not by much. The Dow shed -331 points, -0.93%, while the Nasdaq dropped -309 points, -2.17%. The S&amp;P 500 and small-cap Russell 2000 were down -1.39% and -1.37%, respectively. So far, August looks to be giving back a significant amount of July gains, just in the first two days of the new month’s trading.Qualcomm QCOM is the latest major company to post mixed results in its quarterly report this afternoon: while fiscal Q3 earnings of $1.87 per share bettered the $1.81 in the Zacks consensus, revenues of $8.45 billion came up short of the $8.51 billion. Revenue guidance for fiscal Q4 are for a range of $8.1-8.9 billion, with a midpoint lower than the consensus $8.69 billion. A -25% drop in handset chip sales year over year and a slower recovery in China contributed to the performance. Shares are down -4.5% on the release.MGM Resorts MGM, however, outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines, with earnings of 59 cents per share beating the 53 cents expected, and sales of $3.94 billion in the quarter easily surpassing the $3.76 billion consensus. Its MGM China business in Macau has surprised to the upside, notching +5% growth over 2019 (pre-Covid) levels, +21% on the key EBITDAR metric. However, after cranking +48% higher year to date, investors are selling this news; MGM is -7% in today’s after-market.PayPal PYPL reported in-line earnings at $1.16 per share on $7.29 billion in quarterly revenues, up nearly +7% year over year. Guidance for Q3 looks to be slightly above previous estimates, as Payment Volume grew +11% year over year. That said, Operating Margin of +21.4% in the quarter missed consensus expectations of +22%, and this may be adding fuel to the -7.5% selloff in today’s late trading. PayPal has also been an underperformer year to date.Etsy ETSY posted beats on both top and bottom lines this afternoon, with earnings of 45 cents per share improving by 4 cents over the Zacks consensus, on revenues of $629 million in the quarter. Gross merchandising came in at $3.01 billion, -20% year to date, even as the company noted Etsy Active Buyers reached an all-time high in the quarter. Shares are selling off -5% after normal hours.Closing on a positive note, DoorDash DASH shares are up +4% on its Q2 report out after today’s bell, missing on the bottom line to -44 cents per share by -2 cents, while revenues outpaced estimates: $2.13 billion from $2.05 billion. Guidance was also raised for the delivery service firm, on Gross Orders of $16.47 billion versus $16.1 billion anticipated and Total Orders +25% year over year.Tomorrow, the Q2 earnings season parade continues, highlighted by Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN earnings after the close. It also brings us the next series of data on the state of the domestic labor market — namely, Initial and Continuing Jobless Claims. We’ll also see preliminary U.S. Productivity for Q2, S&amp;P PMI and ISM Services data, both for July, and Factory Orders for June. But we don’t expect any of these data points to reverse market trajectories on their own; likely it will take Friday’s Employment Situation report to bring us this possibility.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

Inflation has declined over the past 12 months, which has now made the Fed sound a lot more confident about the economy having a softer landing than expected earlier.At the same time, personal income and spending have been rising steadily over the past few months. Higher personal income is leading to increased spending, which is being driven by higher demand for goods and services. Given this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in discretionary stocks like Reynolds Consumer Products Inc. REYN, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCLH, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL and Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. LYV.Purchasing Power GrowsThe Commerce Department said on Jul 28 that personal income rose 0.3% in June on a month-over-month basis. Although growth was slightly lower than the economists’ expectations of a rise of 0.5%, personal income has been increasing steadily over the past few months.Simultaneously, the Commerce Department said that personal spending grew 0.5% month over month in June.The report came just two days after the Fed hiked interest rates by 25 basis points for the 11th time since March 2022 after leaving rates unchanged in June. This takes the federal funds rate to the range of 5.25% to 5.5%, its highest level in over 22 years.The July interest rate hike was widely expected as the Fed had indicated that two more interest rate hikes would be required by the end of this year.However, positive inflation data has raised hopes that the Fed could soon end its current monetary tightening cycle as it, too, now believes that the economy might have a softer landing.Inflation has been steadily declining over the past year. The Commerce Department said that Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation increased 2.6% in the second quarter, while core PCE inflation rose 3.8% over the same period. The figures are proof that inflation has been cooling after it increased 4.1% and 4.9%, respectively, in the first quarter.Story continuesThe headline PCE inflation rose a modest 3% year over year in June, its lowest level since March 2021. Also, U.S. GDP increased 2.4% in the second quarter, signaling a slow but steady recovery.Personal income and spending have been climbing as the labor market is resilient despite the Fed’s aggressive rate hike stance. Although the employment rate has somewhat slowed, the economy is witnessing solid job additions, which was 290,000 in June.Higher consumer spending also saw retail grow 0.2% in June. Thus, companies in the consumer discretionary sector are expected to benefit as inflation cools further and personal income grows as it will boost spending. This is because consumers are likely to have more discretionary income, which can be allocated toward non-essential purchases.Our ChoicesTherefore, from an investment perspective, we have identified four stocks from the consumer discretionary sector that are likely to capitalize on reduced inflationary pressure. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Reynolds Consumer Products Inc. is a consumer-branded and private-label products company.

57,f06a4f6e-a4ef-3b50-b770-d802d040d7c8,NCLH,2023-08-03,3 Top Stocks Likely to Flaunt Earnings Acceleration in August,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-stocks-likely-flaunt-113600221.html,1690976160,STORY,['NCLH'],"[August, historically, has been one of the worst months of the year for the major bourses. Hence, investors should look for stocks with superb earnings acceleration. After all, studies have shown that most successful stocks have seen an acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price.Earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in a company’s earnings per share (EPS). In other words, if the rate of a company’s quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time, it can be called earnings acceleration.In the case of earnings growth, you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. But earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven’t yet caught the attention of investors and, once secured, will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both the direction and magnitude of growth rates.An increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period. Meanwhile, a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down.Screening ParametersLet’s look at stocks for which the last two quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the previous periods' growth rates. The projected quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods’ growth rates.EPS % Projected Growth (Q1)/(Q0) greater than EPS % Growth (Q0)/(Q-1): The projected growth rate for the current quarter (Q1) over the completed quarter (Q0) has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1).EPS % Growth (Q0)/(Q-1) greater than EPS % Growth (Q-1)/(Q-2): The growth rate for the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1) has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2).Story continuesEPS % Growth (Q-1)/(Q-2) greater than EPS % Growth (Q-2)/(Q-3): The growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2) has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago (Q-2) over three quarters ago (Q-3).In addition to this, we have added the following parameters:Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This screens out low-priced stocks.Average 20-day volume greater than or equal to 50,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,735 stocks to only three.

This compares to earnings of $2 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.86%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this insurer would post earnings of $1.85 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.52, delivering a surprise of -17.84%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.MetLife , which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, posted revenues of $18.63 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.80%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $18.3 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.MetLife shares have lost about 13.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.2%.What's Next for MetLife?While MetLife has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for MetLife: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.09 on $17.51 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.61 on $68.42 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Insurance - Multi line is currently in the top 42% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, EverQuote (EVER), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023.This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.33 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -175%.

MetLife believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding for MetLife and its investors of MetLife's performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Segment-specific financial measures are calculated using only the portion of consolidated results attributable to that specific segment.The following non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP:Non-GAAP financial measures:Comparable GAAP financial measures:(i)total adjusted revenues;(i)total revenues;(ii)total adjusted expenses;(ii)total expenses;(iii)adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues;(iii)premiums, fees and other revenues;(iv)adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding PRT;(iv)premiums, fees and other revenues;(v)adjusted net investment income;(v)net investment income(vi)adjusted capitalization of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC);(vi)capitalization of DAC;(vii)adjusted earnings available to common shareholders;(vii)net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders;(viii)adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, excluding total notable items;(viii)net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders;(ix)adjusted earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share;(ix)net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders per diluted common share;(x)adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, excluding total notable items, per diluted common share;(x)net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders per diluted common share;(xi)adjusted return on equity;(xi)return on equity;(xii)adjusted return on equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA;(xii)return on equity;(xiii)adjusted return on equity, excluding total notable items (excludes AOCI other than FCTA);(xiii)return on equity;(xiv)investment portfolio gains (losses);(xiv)net investment gains (losses);(xv)derivative gains (losses);(xv)net derivative gains (losses);(xvi)total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA;(xvi)total MetLife, Inc.’s stockholders’ equity;(xvii)total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding total notable items (excludes AOCI other than FCTA);(xvii)total MetLife, Inc.’s stockholders’ equity;(xviii)book value per common share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA;(xviii)book value per common share;(xix)free cash flow of all holding companies;(xix)MetLife, Inc.

As a result, comparable prior period amounts are updated each period to reflect the most recent period average currency exchange rates.Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this earnings news release and in this period’s quarterly financial supplement, which is available at www.metlife.com.MetLife’s definitions of non-GAAP and other financial measures discussed in this news release may differ from those used by other companies:Adjusted earnings and related measuresadjusted earnings;adjusted earnings available to common shareholders;adjusted earnings available to common shareholders on a constant currency basis;adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, excluding total notable items;adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, excluding total notable items, on a constant currency basis;adjusted earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share;adjusted earnings available to common shareholders on a constant currency basis per diluted common share;adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, excluding total notable items per diluted common share; andadjusted earnings available to common shareholders, excluding total notable items, on a constant currency basis per diluted common share.These measures are used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings and components of, or other financial measures based on, adjusted earnings are also MetLife’s GAAP measures of segment performance. Adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings are also the measures by which MetLife senior management’s and many other employees’ performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans. Adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings allow analysis of MetLife's performance relative to its business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results.Effective January 1, 2023, MetLife adopted ASU 2018-12, Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts, as amended (""LDTI""), with a transition date of January 1, 2021, which impacted the calculation of adjusted earnings. Due to the adoption of LDTI, the measurement model was simplified for DAC and value of business acquired (""VOBA""), and most embedded derivatives were reclassified as market risk benefits. As a result, MetLife updated its calculation of adjusted earnings to remove certain adjustments related to the amortization of DAC, VOBA and related intangibles and adjusted for changes in measurement of certain guarantees. Under LDTI, adjusted earnings excludes changes in fair value associated with market risk benefits, changes in discount rates on certain annuitization guarantees, losses at contract inception for certain single premium business, and asymmetrical accounting associated with in-force reinsurance. All periods presented herein reflect the updated calculation of adjusted earnings.Adjusted earnings is defined as adjusted revenues less adjusted expenses, net of income tax. Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders is defined as adjusted earnings less preferred stock dividends.Adjusted revenues and adjusted expensesThese financial measures, along with the related adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, focus on our primary businesses principally by excluding the impact of (i) market volatility which could distort trends, (ii) asymmetrical and non-economic accounting, and (iii) revenues and costs related to divested businesses, non-core products and certain entities required to be consolidated under GAAP. Also, these measures exclude results of discontinued operations under GAAP.Market volatility can have a significant impact on MetLife’s financial results. Adjusted earnings excludes net investment gains (losses), net derivative gains (losses), market risk benefits remeasurement gains (losses) and goodwill impairments. Further, policyholder benefits and claims exclude (i) changes in the discount rate on certain annuitization guarantees accounted for as additional liabilities and (ii) market value adjustments.Asymmetrical and non-economic accounting adjustments are made to the line items indicated in calculating adjusted earnings:Net investment income includes earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment (""Investment hedge adjustments"").Other revenues include settlements of foreign currency earnings hedges.Policyholder benefits and claims excludes (i) amortization of basis adjustments associated with de-designated fair value hedges of future policy benefits, (ii) inflation-indexed benefit adjustments associated with contracts backed by inflation-indexed investments, and (iii) non-economic losses incurred at contract inception for certain single premium annuity business. These losses are amortized into adjusted earnings within policyholder benefits and claims over the estimated lives of the contracts.Interest credited to policyholder account balances excludes amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets and other pass-through adjustments.Divested businesses are those that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife but do not meet the discontinued operations criteria under GAAP. Divested businesses also include the net impact of transactions with exited businesses that have been eliminated in consolidation under GAAP and costs relating to businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife that do not meet the criteria to be included in results of discontinued operations under GAAP.Other adjustments are made to the line items indicated in calculating adjusted earnings:Net investment income and interest credited to policyholder account balances excludes certain amounts related to contractholder-directed equity securities (""Unit-linked contract income"") and (""Unit-linked contract costs"").Other revenues include fee revenue on synthetic GICs accounted for as freestanding derivatives.Other revenues exclude and other expenses include fees received in connection with services provided under transition service agreements.Other expenses exclude (i) implementation of new insurance regulatory requirements and other costs, and (ii) acquisition, integration and other related costs. Other expenses include (i) deductions for net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, and (ii) benefits accrued on synthetic GICs accounted for as freestanding derivatives.Adjusted earnings also excludes the recognition of certain contingent assets and liabilities that could not be recognized at acquisition or adjusted for during the measurement period under GAAP business combination accounting guidance.The tax impact of the adjustments mentioned above are calculated net of the U.S. or foreign statutory tax rate, which could differ from MetLife's effective tax rate. Additionally, the provision for income tax (expense) benefit also includes the impact related to the timing of certain tax credits, as well as certain tax reforms.In addition, adjusted earnings available to common shareholders excludes the impact of preferred stock redemption premium which is reported as a reduction to net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders.Investment portfolio gains (losses) and derivative gains (losses)These are measures of investment and hedging activity. Investment portfolio gains (losses) principally excludes amounts that are reported within net investment gains (losses) but do not relate to the performance of the investment portfolio, such as gains (losses) on sales and divestitures of businesses, as well as investment portfolio gains (losses) of divested businesses. Derivative gains (losses) principally excludes earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives, where such derivatives are either hedges of investments or are used to replicate certain investments, and where such derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting. This earned income and amortization of premium is reported within adjusted earnings and not within derivative gains (losses).Return on equity and related measuresTotal MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA: total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding the net unrealized investment gains (losses), future policy benefits discount rate remeasurement gains (losses), market risk benefits instrument-specific credit risk remeasurement gains (losses) and defined benefit plans adjustment components of AOCI, net of income tax.Total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding total notable items (excludes AOCI other than FCTA): total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding the net unrealized investment gains (losses), future policy benefits discount rate remeasurement gains (losses), market risk benefits instrument-specific credit risk remeasurement gains (losses), defined benefit plans adjustment components of AOCI, and total notable items, net of income tax.Return on MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity: net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc.’s average common stockholders’ equity.Adjusted return on MetLife, Inc.'s common stockholders' equity: adjusted earnings available to common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc.'s average common stockholders' equity.Adjusted return on MetLife, Inc.'s common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA: adjusted earnings available to common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc.'s average common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA.Adjusted return on MetLife, Inc.'s common stockholders' equity, excluding total notable items (excludes AOCI other than FCTA): adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, excluding total notable items, divided by MetLife, Inc.'s average common stockholders' equity, excluding total notable items (excludes AOCI other than FCTA).The above measures represent a level of equity consistent with the view that, in the ordinary course of business, MetLife does not plan to sell most investments for the sole purpose of realizing gains or losses.Expense ratio, direct expense ratio, adjusted expense ratio and related measuresExpense ratio: other expenses, net of capitalization of DAC, divided by premiums, fees and other revenues.Direct expense ratio: adjusted direct expenses, divided by adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues. Direct expenses are comprised of employee-related costs, third-party staffing costs, and general and administrative expenses.Direct expense ratio, excluding total notable items related to direct expenses and PRT: adjusted direct expenses, excluding total notable items related to direct expenses, divided by adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding PRT.Adjusted expense ratio: adjusted other expenses, net of adjusted capitalization of DAC, divided by adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues.Adjusted expense ratio, excluding total notable items related to adjusted other expenses and PRT: adjusted other expenses, net of adjusted capitalization of DAC, excluding total notable items related to adjusted other expenses, divided by adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding PRT.Asia General account (GA) assets under management (GA AUM) and related measuresAsia GA AUM is used by MetLife to describe assets in its Asia GA investment portfolio. Asia GA AUM is stated at estimated fair value and is comprised of Asia GA total investments, the portion of the Asia GA investment portfolio classified within assets held-for-sale and cash and cash equivalents, excluding policy loans, contractholder-directed equity securities, fair value option securities, mortgage loans originated for third parties and certain other invested assets. Mortgage loans, net of mortgage loans originated for third parties (""net mortgage loans"") (including commercial (""net commercial mortgage loans""), agricultural (""net agricultural mortgage loans"") and residential mortgage loans) and real estate equity (including real estate and real estate joint ventures) included in Asia GA AUM (at net asset value, net of deduction for encumbering debt) have been adjusted from carrying value to estimated fair value. At the segment level, intersegment balances (intercompany activity, primarily related to investments in subsidiaries, that eliminate at the MetLife consolidated level) are excluded from Asia GA AUM.Asia GA AUM (at amortized cost) excludes the following adjustments: (i) unrealized gain (loss) on investments carried at estimated fair value and (ii) adjustments from carrying value to estimated fair value on net mortgage loans (including net commercial mortgage loans, net agricultural mortgage loans and residential mortgage loans) and real estate and real estate joint ventures. Asia GA AUM (at amortized cost) is presented net of related allowance for credit loss.Statistical sales information:U.S.:Group Benefits: calculated using 10% of single premium deposits and 100% of annualized full-year premiums and fees from recurring premium policy sales of all products.Retirement and Income Solutions: calculated using 10% of single premium deposits and 100% of annualized full-year premiums and fees only from recurring premium policy sales of specialized benefit resources and corporate-owned life insurance.Latin America, Asia and EMEA: calculated using 10% of single-premium deposits (mainly from retirement products such as variable annuity, fixed annuity and pensions), 20% of single-premium deposits from credit insurance and 100% of annualized full-year premiums and fees from recurring-premium policy sales of all products (mainly from risk and protection products such as individual life, accident &amp; health and group).Sales statistics do not correspond to revenues under GAAP, but are used as relevant measures of business activity.The following additional information is relevant to an understanding of MetLife’s performance results and outlook:Volume growth, as discussed in the context of business growth, is the period over period percentage change in adjusted earnings available to common shareholders attributable to adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues and assets under management levels, applying a model in which certain margins and factors are held constant. The most significant of such items are underwriting margins, investment margins, changes in equity market performance, expense margins and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Holding company cash and liquid assets are held by MetLife, Inc. collectively with other MetLife holding companies and include cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and publicly traded securities excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, regulatory deposits, the collateral financing arrangement, funding agreements and secured borrowings, as well as amounts held in the closed block.MetLife uses a measure of free cash flow to facilitate an understanding of its ability to generate cash for reinvestment into its businesses or use in non-mandatory capital actions. MetLife defines free cash flow as the sum of cash available at MetLife’s holding companies from dividends from operating subsidiaries, expenses and other net flows of the holding companies (including capital contributions to subsidiaries), and net contributions from debt to be at or below target leverage ratios. This measure of free cash flow is prior to capital actions, such as common stock dividends and repurchases, debt reduction and mergers and acquisitions. Free cash flow should not be viewed as a substitute for net cash provided by (used in) operating activities calculated in accordance with GAAP. The free cash flow ratio is typically expressed as a percentage of annual adjusted earnings available to common shareholders.Notable items reflect the unexpected impact of events that affect MetLife’s results, but that were unknown and that MetLife could not anticipate when it devised its business plan. Notable items also include certain items regardless of the extent anticipated in the business plan, to help investors have a better understanding of MetLife's results and to evaluate and forecast those results. Notable items represent a positive (negative) impact to adjusted earnings available to common shareholders.We refer to observable forward yield curves as of a particular date in connection with making our estimates for future results. The observable forward yield curves at a given time are based on implied future interest rates along a range of interest rate durations. This includes the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate which we use as a benchmark rate to describe longer-term interest rates used in our estimates for future results.Forward-Looking StatementsThis news release may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(NYSE:IT) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript August 1, 2023Gartner, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $2.85, expectations were $2.51.David Cohen: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Gartner's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I'm David Cohen, SVP of Investor Relations.

On the call, unless stated otherwise, all references to EBITDA are for adjusted EBITDA, with the adjustments as described in our earnings release and supplement.Our contract values and associated growth rates we discuss are based on 2023 foreign exchange rates and exclude contributions related to the recent first quarter divestiture and the 2022 Russia exit. All growth rates in Gene's comments are FX neutral, unless stated otherwise. All references to share counts are for fully diluted weighted average share counts unless stated otherwise.

Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as in other filings with the SEC.I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents. Now I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.Story continuesGene Hall: Good morning. And thanks for joining us today. Garner drove another strong performance in Q2. We delivered double-digit revenue growth and high-single digit growth in contract value. EBITDA. EBITDA margins, and adjusted EPS came in above expectations as a result of modest revenue upside and disciplined cost management. Free cash flow in the quarter was excellent. The environment remains highly uncertain. The tech sector continues to adjust to post pandemic demand. The banking industry is grappling with rising interest rates. Many industries continue to be impacted by supply chain challenges and more. Enterprise leaders and their teams need actionable, objective insight. Gartner is the best source for the insight, tools and advice that make the difference between success and failure for these leaders and the enterprises they serve.We're helping our clients make better decisions, whether they're thriving or struggling or anywhere in between. We do this through consistent execution of operational best practices. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. We guide leaders across all major enterprise functions. Our market opportunity is fast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. We estimate our opportunity at around $200 billion. 95% of our addressable market is with enterprise functional leaders like chief information officers, CFOs, heads of supply chain and more. The balance of the market opportunity is with technology vendors. In the second quarter, we helped clients with a wide range of topics, including cybersecurity, data analytics, artificial intelligence, remote work, cost optimization and more.Research revenue grew 7% in Q2. Subscription revenue grew 9% on an organic basis. Total contract value growth was 9%. Contract value for enterprise function leaders continued to grow at double-digit rates. We serve executives and our teams through distinct sales channels. Global technology sales or GTS stores leaders and their teams within IT. GTS also serves leaders and technology vendors, including CEOs, chief marketing officers and senior product leaders. GTS contract value grew 7%. GTS sales to enterprise function leaders performed well in the quarter. GTS sales to leaders and technology vendors were affected by technology sector dynamics and tough year-over-year comparisons. We expect sales to technology vendors will return to our target growth rates over the medium term.Global business sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value grew 15%. Through relentless execution of proven practices, we're able to deliver unparalleled value to our clients. Our business remains resilient, despite a persistent complicated external environments and tough compares for the technology vendor market. Gartner Conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. This will be the first full year of in-person conferences since 2019, and we're off to a great start. Attendance is strong. Exhibitor bookings are at record levels, and feedback continues to be excellent. We had a great first half and the outlook for the year is strong.Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 6% in the second quarter. We updated our 2023 guidance, increasing EBITDA and free cash flow. We've revised our non-subscription research revenue to reflect technology vendor dynamics, and our outlook for conferences is higher. Craig will take you through the details. In closing, Gartner achieved another strong quarter of growth. We deliver unparalleled value to enterprise leaders and their teams across every major function, whether they're thriving, struggling or anywhere in between. We're exceptionally agile and continuously adapt to the changing world.We know the right things to do to be successful in any environment. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to continue our sustained record of success far into the future. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long term, sustained, double-digit revenue growth. We expect margins will expand modestly over time, and we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. Even as we invest for future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This reduces shares outstanding and increases returns over time. With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.Craig Safian: Thank you, Gene. And good morning. Second quarter results were strong, with high-single digit growth in contract value and double-digit FX neutral revenue growth. EBITDA, EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS were better than expected as a result of modest revenue upside and disciplined cost management. Free cash flow in the quarter was excellent. With good visibility into the balance of the year, we are increasing our 2023 EBITDA and free cash flow guidance. Second quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, up 9% year-over-year as reported and 10% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68% compared to 69% in the prior year as we caught up on hiring during 2022. EBITDA was $384 million, ahead of our guidance and about in line with last year.Adjusted EPS was $2.85, consistent with Q2 of last year. And free cash flow was $410 million. We finished the quarter with 20,104 associates, up 12% from the prior year and 1% from the end of the first quarter. We remain well positioned from a talent perspective, with low levels of open territories and our new associates coming up the tenure curve. We will continue to carefully calibrate headcount and operating expenses based on near term revenue growth and opportunities to invest for the future. Research revenue in the second quarter grew 6% year-over-year as reported and 7% on a FX neutral basis. Subscription revenue grew 9% on an organic FX neutral basis. Second quarter Research contribution margin was 73% compared to 74% in the prior-year period, as we have caught up on hiring and return to the new expected levels of travel.Contract value, or CV, was $4.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 9% versus the prior year. The second quarter last year was one of our strongest research quarters ever, with outstanding performance on nearly every metric we provide. CV growth is FX neutral and excludes the first quarter of 2023 divestiture. CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew at double-digit rates. CV from tech vendors grew low-single digits compared to mid-teens growth in the second quarter of 2022. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCBI, was $41 million. As we've discussed in the past, there's notable seasonality in this metric. CV growth was broad based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, the majority of industry sectors grew at double-digit rates, again led by the transportation, retail and public sectors.We had high-single digit growth across all of our enterprise size categories other than the small category, which grew mid-single digits. This category has the largest tech vendor mix. We also drove double-digit or high-single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries. Global technology sales contract value was $3.5 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 7% versus the prior year. GPS had quarterly NCBI of $14 million. Wallet retention for GTS was 102% for the quarter, which compares to 107% in the prior year when we saw a record high for this metric. IT enterprise function leaders wallet retention remained above historical GTS levels during the second quarter. GTS new business was down 4% versus last year. New business with IT enterprise function leaders increased high-single digits compared to the prior year against the tough compare.Source: PEXELSGTS quota-bearing headcount was up 13% year-over-year, reflecting the catch-up hiring we did in 2022. We will continue to manage hiring based on both short term performance and the medium term opportunity. A regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Global business sales contract value was $1 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 15% year-over-year, which remains towards the higher end of our medium term outlook of 12% to 16%. All of our GBS practices grew at double-digit or high-single digit rates, again led by supply chain and HR. GBS CV increased $27 million from the first quarter. Wallet retention for GBS was 109% for the quarter as compared to 115% in the prior year when we saw one of the highest ever results for this metric.GBS new business was up 2% compared to last year against the strong compare. GBS quota-bearing headcount was up 15% year-over-year. This excludes headcount associated with the Q1 divestiture. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the second quarter was $169 million, ahead of our expectations as we saw strong performance with both exhibitors and attendees. Contribution margin in the quarter was 58%, consistent with typical seasonality. We held 17 destination conferences in the quarter, all in person. Second quarter Consulting revenues increased by 5% year-over-year to $126 million. On an FX neutral basis, revenues were up 6%. Consulting contribution margin was 37% in the second quarter.Labor-based revenues were $104 million, up 9% versus Q2 of last year and up 11% on an FX neutral basis. Backlog at June 30 was $172 million, increasing 17% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis with continued booking strength. Our contract optimization business is highly variable. We delivered $22 million of revenue in the quarter and the pipeline for both contract optimization and labor-based revenues remained strong. Consolidated cost of services increased 15% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and on an FX neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher headcount to support our continued strong growth. We also saw an increase in cost year-over-year with the return to in-person conferences. SG&amp;A increased 12% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and 14% on an FX mutual basis.SG&amp;A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth. EBITDA for the second quarter was $384 million compared to $389 million in the year-ago period. Second quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance reflected revenue exceeding our expectations in conferences and prudent expense management. Depreciation in the quarter of $24 million was up modestly compared to 2022. Net interest expense excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $23 million. This was down $5 million versus the second quarter of 2022 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity. The Q2 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 25% for the quarter.The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 27% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q2 was $2.85, in line with last year. We had 80 million shares outstanding in the second quarter. This is a reduction of close to 1 million shares or about 1% year-over-year. We exited the second quarter with about 80 million shares on an unweighted basis. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $436 million, up 5% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $26 million, up 21% year-over-year as a result of an increase in technology investments. Free cash flow for the quarter was $410 million. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue on a rolling four quarter basis was 17% of revenue and 66% of EBITDA. Adjusted for the after tax impact of the Q1 divestiture, free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income was 119%.Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating. At the end of the second quarter, we had about $1.2 billion of cash. Our June 30 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2 times. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&amp;A. Our balance sheet is very strong, with $2.2 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased $132 million of stock during the second quarter. We had about $830 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization at June 30.We expect the board to continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward. As we continue to repurchase shares our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. We are increasing our full year Conferences EBITDA and free cash flow guidance to reflect the strong Q2 performance. We are updating our Research revenue guidance to reflect tech vendor market dynamics on the non-subscription part of the business. For Research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. We've got tough compares across most of the segment for another quarter. We expect stronger growth from subscription business and the non-subscription part of the segment as we indicated last quarter.The non-subscription part of the business has direct exposure to tech vendor spending. The outlook continues to be based on all of our 47 destination conferences for 2023 running in-person. There is seasonality to the business based on the conference's calendar, which is different than the historical pattern. We still expect Q4 to be the largest quarter of the year. We expect Q3 will be the smallest revenue quarter of the year as I noted in May. For Consulting revenues, contract optimization remains highly variable. We had a very strong year in 2022, especially in contract optimization in the fourth quarter. We will continue both to manage expenses prudently to support future growth and deliver strong margins. Our updated 2023 guidance is as follows.We expect Research revenue of at least $4.855 billion, which is FX neutral growth of about 6%, or 7% excluding the Q1 divestiture. The update to Research revenue guidance reflects the effect of tech vendor market dynamics on the non-subscription part of the business. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $490 million, which is growth of about 26%. We've increased our outlook for Conferences by $20 million. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $505 million, which is growth of about 5% FX neutral, consistent with the outlook we gave in May. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.85 billion, which is FX neutral growth of 7%. The guidance reflects an update to non-subscription Research revenue, partially offset by an increase to Conferences.We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.36 billion, up $30 million from our prior guidance and an increase in our margin outlook as well. We will deliver on our margin guidance in most economic scenarios. If revenue is stronger than our outlook, EBITDA would be better than our guidance. We now expect 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $10. For 2023, we now expect free cash flow of at least $975 million, up $55 million from our prior guidance. This higher free cash flow reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of about 140% excluding the after tax divestiture proceeds. Our guidance is based on 80 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of June. Finally, for the third quarter of 2023, we expect EBITDA of at least $275 million.We had a strong first half despite continuing global macro uncertainty in a dynamic tech vendor market. TV and revenue grew high-single digits in the quarter. Conferences and EBITDA performance exceeded our expectations, and we increased our guidance as well. Margins are strong, consistent with our prior commentary. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter and we increased the guidance for the full year. We repurchased over $230 million in stock during the first half and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. And we have ample liquidity that we are ready to deploy on behalf of shareholders over the coming quarters. Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% Research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth.With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV growth over time, and G&amp;A leverage, we can modestly expand margins. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us up front. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value enhancing tuck-in M&amp;A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions.

Despite labor market tightness, some analysts said the inflation outlook continues to improve.Story continuesAt the same time, the U.S. services sector slowed in July as businesses faced higher prices for inputs even though demand continued to hold up, suggesting the road to low inflation could be long and slow.""The ISM (Institute for Supply Management) activity indicators suggest that manufacturing is in recession and service sector output is becoming a little more sluggish,"" analysts at ING, a bank, said in a note.In China, the world's second biggest oil consumer, the central bank pledged to guide more financial resources towards the private economy, suggesting new urgency from Beijing to bolster confidence as economic momentum weakens.In the UK, the Bank of England raised its key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a 15-year high of 5.25%, its 14th back-to-back increase, and warned that borrowing costs were likely to stay high for some time.In Europe, a downturn in euro zone business activity worsened more than initially thought in July as the slump in manufacturing was accompanied by a further slowing of growth in the bloc's dominant services industry.(Additional reporting by Alex Lawler and Natalie Grover in London, Andrew Hayley in Beijing and Sudarshan Varadhan in Singapore; Editing by Kirsten Donovan, Barbara Lewis, Chris Reese and Kevin Liffey)]"

The Nasdaq index is up 35% on the year, with the S&amp;P 500 up nearly 20% since Jan. The upsurge is being driven by a number of growth stocks, many of which just reported strong second-quarter earnings. Yes, technology stocks have led the way thanks to artificial intelligence.Moving through the second half of this year, equities look to continue trending higher, lifted by a surge in growth stocks. Knowing which stocks to take a position in as the rally gathers steam will be important for investors. If you can only buy one growth stock, it better be one of these seven top growth stocks.Top Growth Stocks: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Hand of woman watering small plant in pot shaped like growing graph representing growth stocksSource: Khakimullin Aleksandr / ShutterstockAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL/NASDAQ:GOOG) just reported exceptionally strong second-quarter earnings. Driven largely by growth in its cloud-computing unit, Alphabet posted an EPS of $1.44, as compared to expectations for $1.34. Revenue came in at $74.6 billion, as compared to $72.82 billion. Better, its YouTube advertising revenue totaled $7.67 billion, as compared to expectations for $7.43 billion. Google Cloud’s revenue came in at $8.03 billion, as compared to a forecast for $7.87 billion. Other Bets, which include the Waymo self-driving car, reported a 48% increase in revenue to $285 million. These strong results show that Alphabet is back on track after last year’s downturn.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith the Q2 earnings bump, GOOGL stock has gained 46% this year, making it a top growth stock.Top Growth Stocks: American Airlines (AAL)A businessman holding a coin with a tree that grows and a tree that grows on a pile of money representing growth stocks. growth stocksSource: MEE KO DONG / ShutterstockTravel is back and airlines are flying high as a result. Chief among the carriers that are benefitting from rising travel demand is American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). The world’s largest international carrier just reported Q2 earnings that crushed Wall Street forecasts across the board. The company announced an EPS of $1.92 versus the $1.59 that was expected. Revenue came in at $14.06 billion compared to $13.74 billion which had been the consensus forecast on Wall Street.Story continuesThe airline also raised its forward guidance for all of this year, saying it now expects the current travel boom to continue throughout this year’s second half and into 2024. American Airlines’ strong Q2 print came after rival carrier United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) announced record earnings for the April through June period. With us now in the midst of the busy summer travel season, American Airlines can be expected to post even stronger Q3 results. AAL stock has rallied 31% this year, but analysts see more gains ahead for the carrier’s stock.Top Growth Stocks: Netflix (NFLX)An image of three yellow arrows on a red background.Source: smshoot/ShutterStock.comShares of streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) are down 6% after the company recently reported its Q2 earnings. However, the stock is not likely to be down long and investors should buy the dip. For one, Netflix’s latest print wasn’t really bad at all. Two, the stock is being weighed down by concerns about the actors and writers’ strike in Hollywood, which has shut down the production of TV shows and movies. However, the strike is likely to be temporary and Netflix is more immune than most studios to the strike’s impact.The main problem with Netflix’s Q2 print was the forward guidance. The company’s revenue in Q2 rose 2.7% from a year earlier to $8.19 billion, matching analysts’ expectations. EPS of $3.29 beat consensus forecasts for earnings of $2.86 a share. Most impressive, Netflix added 5.9 million net new subscribers during the quarter, which handily beat the 1.9 million that was expected. Netflix ended the quarter with 238.4 million paying subscribers worldwide.Unfortunately, Netflix called for revenue of $8.52 billion in the current third quarter, which was lower than the $8.67 billion that had been anticipated, sending the stock lower. If it weren’t for that guidance, NFLX stock would likely be rising. Despite the current pullback, the company’s share price is still up 96% over the last 12 months, proving that this is an essential growth stock.American Express (AXP)A hand reaches up on a red ladder pointing to the sky.Source: ShutterstockAnother company that is benefitting from a resurgence in travel is American Express (NYSE:AXP). The credit card company said in its Q2 earnings statement that it saw record levels of spending on its credit cards between April and June of this year, notably from purchases related to travel and entertainment. This led American Express to report Q2 EPS of $2.89, which was better than the consensus forecast of $2.81 among Wall Street analysts.While revenue for the quarter ended June 30 came in a little light at $15.05 billion, which was below the consensus estimate of $15.41 billion, American Express reaffirmed its full-year 2023 guidance. The company continues to expect earnings of $11.00 to $11.40 a share, which is strong and reflects the continued resilience of consumer spending. While AXP stock has pulled back 5% since the Q2 print, the stock is still up 13% on the year. Make no mistake, American Express remains a high-potential growth stock.Morgan Stanley (MS)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comAmong U.S. banks, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) stood out with its second-quarter results. The leading investment bank announced earnings that beat consensus expectations on both the top and bottom lines, with EPS of $1.24, which was better than expectations for $1.15, and revenue of $13.46 billion versus $13.08 billion that was forecast. Morgan Stanley continues to focus on wealth management, which has helped distinguish the investment bank from its peers and carry it through the current drought in Wall Street deals.While rival investment banks such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) have suffered due to a continued lack of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) and initial public offerings (IPOs), Morgan Stanley’s diversified approach and growth in wealth management has made it more resilient. News that Morgan Stanley’s CEO James Gorman plans to retire in early 2024 has raised some concerns at the bank. But long term, the investment house should be fine. MS stock has gained 16% in the last 12 months, including a 10% increase this year.Tesla (TSLA)train.Source: ShutterstockWhile the stock continues to be volatile, it just doesn’t make sense to bet against Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The electric vehicle maker has proven just about every bear on Wall Street wrong, forcing many to cover their short bets against its stock. This year alone, TSLA stock is up 144% following a steep decline last fall after CEO Elon Musk acquired the company formerly known as Twitter, and concerns were raised about his focus on electric cars.More recently, TSLA stock has slumped 5% since the company issued its latest earnings on July 19. Judging by past performance, TSLA stock won’t be down for long. The company beat Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines with revenue of $24.93 billion and EPS of 91 cents. The issue was the margins, with Tesla reporting that its operating margins came in at 9.6%, the lowest level in five quarters. That was due to price discounts and other incentives offered on its EVs. But don’t fret. TSLA stock has gained more than 1,200% in the last five years.PepsiCo (PEP)growth stocks. Growth Stocks to SellSource: REDPIXEL.PL / Shutterstock.comWhile it’s often not thought of as a growth stock, beverage, and snack giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) continues to post impressive earnings and growth in its core business. The company, which makes consumer products such as the Pepsi soft drink and Lay’s potato chips, reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings and raised its full-year guidance. Specifically, Pepsi said it earned $2.09 a share for the quarter ended June 30. That was much better than the consensus Wall Street forecasts for EPS of $1.96.Revenue in Q2 totaled $22.32 billion compared to $21.73 billion which was expected by analysts. Revenue was up 10% year-over-year during the April through June period. In terms of forward guidance, PepsiCo said it now expects its full-year revenues to grow a further 10%, up from a previous forecast of 8% growth. EPS is forecast to come in at $7.47 for the entire year, up from an earlier forecast of $7.27. PEP stock has gained 12% over the last year and would be great to own in a recession.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in GOOGL.

The commission is a division of the state attorney general's office.The payments were the focus of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement between the Akron-based firm and federal authorities in which the company agreed to pay a $230 million penalty and cooperate with investigators. The company said in its filing Monday that it had been unaware of the state investigation.In the federal agreement, FirstEnergy acknowledged having bankrolled former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder’s political ascendance in exchange for nuclear plant bailout legislation worth more than $1 billion to the company. Householder was convicted by a federal jury in June of racketeering in the $60 million scheme and was sentenced to 20 years. He is appealing. Lobbyist Matt Borges, former chair of the Ohio Republican Party, was also convicted of racketeering and sentenced to the minimum of five years in prison, which he is also appealing.FirstEnergy also said it paid $4.3 million for favorable treatment to Sam Randazzo, the state’s former top utility regulator, who had ties to the company. Randazzo hasn't been charged and has said he never used his position to further the firm's interests.FirstEnergy spokesperson Jennifer Young told Cleveland.com that the firm believes the state organized crime commission's investigation is in an early stage and declined to comment further. She said FirstEnergy has “accepted full responsibility for its past actions” and addressed them by entering into the deferred prosecution agreement and paying a “substantial penalty.”Story continuesBethany McCorkle, a spokesperson for Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, said her office would be legally barred from talking about any investigation before filing charges and also declined to provide a copy of the subpoena, Cleveland.com reported.FirstEnergy's former chief executive officer had said in an April court filing that the firm faced “looming potential indictments.” A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe of the company continues.The utility serves a number of states, including Ohio, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.]"

(ATSI), a subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE), is using helicopters and ground crews to replace more than 550 insulators and attachments along a 35-mile section of a transmission line that runs through Mahoning, Columbiana and Jefferson counties in northeast Ohio. The highly visible work will help ensure the regional electric grid remains reliable and resilient.FirstEnergy Corp. Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)The 138-kilovolt transmission line runs south from a substation in Boardman Township to a substation in Stratton and traverses Beaver, Fairfield, Elkrun, Madison, Yellow Creek and Saline townships. Insulators separate high-voltage transmission lines from their grounded support towers and help maintain safe, consistent delivery of power.Crews from Ohio Edison, another FirstEnergy subsidiary, will perform a 10-mile portion of the insulator replacement work between Boardman Township and the Columbiana County line, while the balance of the replacements will be handled by a contractor that carries line workers to the top of the transmission towers via helicopter. The line workers will be harnessed and lowered down onto each structure to install the new insulators and attachments. The helicopter will also lower the new materials for the assembly and carry the old materials away.This aerial method is more efficient than deploying ground crews to each structure, which would require the creation of access roads for large trucks and equipment. ATSI began replacing the insulators in July and expects to complete the replacements along the corridor this fall. The transmission line has been deenergized until the work is complete but is not disrupting service to customers, who are being served by an alternate power feed.""By installing new, upgraded equipment along this high-voltage line, we can help prevent potential power outages and ensure that our transmission system continues to serve customers safely and reliably in the future,"" said Carl Bridenbaugh, FirstEnergy's vice president of Transmission.Story continuesThe project is part of Energizing the Future, a multi-year initiative designed to upgrade FirstEnergy's transmission system with advanced equipment and technologies that will reinforce the power grid and help reduce the frequency and duration of customer outages. Since 2014, FirstEnergy has upgraded or replaced existing power lines, incorporated smart technology into the grid and upgraded dozens of substations with new equipment and enhanced security features. Through 2022, FirstEnergy had invested more than $10 billion in the Energizing the Future initiative.FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence. Its 10 electric distribution companies form one of the nation's largest investor-owned electric systems, serving customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and New York. The company's transmission subsidiaries operate approximately 24,000 miles of transmission lines that connect the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions.

82,4f218dc7-1b94-3bc9-a30d-453bfd2347c6,CRM,2023-08-03,AI has become 'a tremendous innovation proof point': Slack CEO,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ai-become-tremendous-innovation-proof-145303474.html,1690987983,VIDEO,['CRM'],"[Salesforce (CRM) acquired workspace messenger Slack in 2021 for $27.7 billion. Two whole years later, the tech companies are plotting out how to best integrate and collaborate with each other through new automation trends.Slack CEO Lidiane Jones joins Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to discuss Slack and Salesforce’s strategy to implement AI for their clients, stating: “We are seeing a faster adoption to automation. We’re using our platform for every part of the organization.”Jones references Slack's State of Work report, highlighting how workers are seeing a ""need for connection"" by returning to the office and emphasizing the need for ""more purposeful time together"" when teams are in the office together.""We are a platform that supports this hybrid work environment, so customers are taking advantage of the platform to support this evolution of how we all work together,"" Jone told Sozzi.Video TranscriptMARC BENIOFF: This AI wave is going to be the biggest that anyone has ever seen. I think that the success of OpenAI is the point of evidence that this is going to be one of the fastest growing moves not just in the consumer market but in the enterprise market.BRIAN SOZZI: That was my conversation with Salesforce co-founder and CEO, Marc Benioff, back in June. Earlier this year, he told me the tech giant wanted to be the most profitable software company in the world. That he was ready to hit the hyperspace button as well. He was also trying to outmaneuver a string of activist investors like Elliott Management and Starboard urging him to cut expenses and boost profits. One of their big complaints was the lack of a clear integration between Salesforce's core products and some very pricey acquisitions.At the top of the heap with Slack, the messaging service acquired in 2021 for $27.7 billion. The deal is meant to make the business more connected than ever before. Now under the leadership of CEO, Lidiane Jones, Slack has leaned into the world of generative AI. So two years after this mega deal and with a new leader at the helm has the Slackification of Salesforce actually happen.Story continuesLet's dive in here with Lidiane Jones, Slack's new CEO. Lidiane, welcome to Yahoo Finance. Good to connect with you here. Six months into this job, what is the state of Slack? And what is the state of this business inside of Salesforce?LIDIANE JONES: Brian, thank you for having me. We are seeing incredible momentum from our customers that are really bringing to bear the Slack intelligent productivity platform across every line of business. And today, we are announcing a brand new integration, native Sales Cloud integration into Slack, which really showcases the power of bringing productivity for the customer base that Salesforce has been a great leader over the course of the last 25 years. So it's an exciting day to showcase what we can do across our products.BRIAN SOZZI: Has the Holy Grail of this integration between Slack and Salesforce been realized or do you need more time?LIDIANE JONES: We certainly are seeing phenomenal customer feedback and excitement for what we can do with products like this. So we are already innovating, bringing Slack and Salesforce together in great brands like Ford, IBM, Target, that are really transforming automation in connecting teams with Slack and connecting all of that incredible CRM data directly into our products. So really, bringing collaboration in CRM to supercharge productivity for their businesses.So that's been a phenomenal proof point, Brian, that we are excited to continue to drive forward in the quarters to come.BRIAN SOZZI: I think the team a couple of weeks ago garnered a lot of excitement on the street regarding pricing for new generative AI tools. How does the pricing for this product get weaved into a broader Salesforce product?LIDIANE JONES: Certainly, we are excited to focus on augmenting our pricing to launch a productivity gain for revenue teams. So we will price per user as we have on our Sales Cloud products. But bring a consumer grade, consumption grade pricing for AI on top of that. So it is just very aligned with the rest of the pricing strategy for Salesforce.BRIAN SOZZI: How are these new advances on Slack and broader work from home tools as it pertains to AI, how are they going to change my working life?LIDIANE JONES: Brian, as you and I, I'm sure experience in many of our customers, there's just a lot happening. Teams are trying to be more productive, trying to do more with less across every part of the organization. And AI has really become a tremendous innovation proof point. So we can now bring in Slack native experiences that will help you catch up to your work. So email referencing to be able to bring insights.So if you go into a channel and there's a lot of conversation happening, you can catch up on Threads, you can catch up on what you have missed maybe in the last week. It just really accelerates productivity for everybody on the team. So we are really excited about that.But we have also seen a lot of our customers use our open platform to develop AI-led automation as well. So we are seeing a faster adoption to automation. We're using our platform for every part of the organization.BRIAN SOZZI: Having covered Slack for a long time, I know small businesses are very important to your platform. We just had a pretty strong ADP employment report earlier this morning, small businesses leading the charge. What are you seeing from that customer base right now?LIDIANE JONES: Over the course of the last several quarters, we continue to see a very rapid growth of new organizations adopting Slack. So we really measure, Brian, how many new teams and customers are choosing Slack at our SMB self-service business, and that number continues to grow. So we see that as a great sign that the small business economy is revamping up, and it's been a really exciting number to see.BRIAN SOZZI: And a lot of these small businesses are joining larger businesses and mandating people go back to the office. Lidiane, there's really this, I think, old guard trying to get human beings back into offices for creativity purposes or just to flex their own muscle or their own leadership baton. How is this impacting Slack?LIDIANE JONES: Brian, we launched a state-of-work report a couple of months ago. And there is certainly a desire for more people to go back to the office. But we have seen from employees as well that there is a need for connection.So what's been most effective and certainly what we are adopting in Slack and many of our customers are is using more purposeful time together in the office, where people are really coming together not just to be there with people they don't work with every day, but rather really be there for actions that will help them all succeed. So for us, it's been onboarding employees. It's more effective to do that in person. It's in product planning. It's more effective.And teams really needed that connection to understand the culture of their organizations, to feel connected to their colleagues, and to accelerate their decision-making. So that purposeful time in person has been very impactful.And what's been great about Slack is that we are a platform that supports this hybrid work environment. So customers are taking advantage of the platform to support this evolution of how we all work together.BRIAN SOZZI: And Lidiane, I would argue, you are now leading the most important acquisition, the most important business inside of Salesforce that they have acquired in the last decade. Again, that's my view. Tell us a little bit about yourself. How did you get into that seat?LIDIANE JONES: Well, Brian, it's an honor of a lifetime to lead a product that is as loved as Slack is in an organization like Salesforce that customers truly believe and bet their companies on. So it's a tremendous opportunity.And I think what makes me the right person to lead this team is that I've been here with Salesforce for four years. So I understand our Salesforce customer base. But I have also been a customer of Slack for the last seven years. So bringing the best of both worlds is our vision. Really bringing Slack as the front door of experiences for all of our Salesforce customers is what we're aiming for. And so I'm thrilled to be leading this team.BRIAN SOZZI: What's your biggest hope in terms of leading Slack? And how would you describe your leadership style?LIDIANE JONES: I really believe in doing what's right for our customers, first and foremost, and it's very aligned with our values of customer success and trust. So what I envisioned for the future is that we are going to transform how every part of our customer 360 of Salesforce, how work is done. And we believe it is-- I certainly believe that it is all of our teams coming together. It's the sales team collaborating with the service team and the marketing team. So really bringing the connecting tissue that will help companies break organizational silos to be more productive and better serve their customers.So I'm excited to bring that vision to bear. I think it's been an exciting six months and just the beginning of optimistic and future ahead.BRIAN SOZZI: All right, well, good luck on your CEO journey. Looking forward to seeing you potentially in a Dreamforce in a couple of months. Lidiane Jones, Slack CEO, we'll talk to you soon.LIDIANE JONES: Thank you, Brian. See you soon.]"

It will cost $60 a month per user on top of existing subscription fees for Slack and Salesforce.The update is designed to make Slack and Sales Cloud work better together, reducing time spent on administrative tasks or flicking between apps, Slack Chief Executive Officer Lidiane Jones said in an interview. Internal tests show a 76% reduction in editing information on prospective deals, which often sucks up a lot of time, she said. Other major Salesforce apps such as those for marketing and customer service will also get specific Slack products in the future, she added.Since acquiring Slack in July 2021 for $27.7 billion, Salesforce has worked to increase compatibility between its commerce tools and the workplace communications platform. Jones, who was appointed late last year when Slack co-founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield stepped down, plans to integrate key elements of Salesforce’s other products into Slack. “Slack can be the front door of Salesforce,” she said.Cross-selling Slack with other products may also be easier now that “Slack Sales Elevate” is released, Jones said. The product will make it easier to explain the value of bundling Slack into other contracts, she said. As Salesforce works to boost profit, it wants employees to sell a wider variety of services, thus requiring fewer salespeople. Slack’s sales teams are now integrated in the company’s wider go-to-market division, while staff focused on building the product report to Jones, she said.Story continuesSlack’s largest competitor, Microsoft Corp.’s Teams, is the subject of a European regulatory probe. The European Commission said Thursday it opened a formal investigation into whether Microsoft had breached competition rules by tying or bundling Teams to its other office software. This comes three years after Slack made a complaint to the EU’s antitrust authority. “We’ve been collaborating with the European Commission and so certainly we welcome the movement,” Jones said.Before leading Slack, Jones oversaw Salesforce’s marketing and commerce software and spent time at Sonos Inc. and Microsoft.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Scott Rowe, Flowserve's President and Chief Executive Officer, for his prepared comments.Story continuesRobert Scott RoweGreat. Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I couldn't be more pleased with the results that we delivered in the second quarter, including our adjusted earnings per share of $0.52. We continue to build on the operating momentum established at the end of last year, and I believe we are now delivering much closer to our true capabilities. I want to start by thanking our associates for their commitment to our customers and the Flowserve. Without their persistence and dedication, we wouldn't be in such a good place. Our results for the second quarter were highlighted by the sixth consecutive quarter with bookings over $1 billion, our highest quarterly level of revenue since 2015 and our second consecutive quarter delivering adjusted gross margins above 30%. Our improved operational execution, combined with our constructive market outlook has led us to raise our full year revenue and adjusted EPS targets. During the second quarter, we generated bookings of over $1.1 billion. This performance drove our first half book-to-bill of 1.05 and our backlog to near-record levels, which reflects the success of our targeted 3D growth strategy and our customers' ongoing global focus on energy security and decarbonization. 3D awards increased roughly 9% versus the prior year to $325 million. This amount included discrete energy transition and new energy awards exceeding $50 million, which represented an increase of 24% compared to last year. Similar to the first quarter, we did not benefit from any large projects awarded in the second quarter. In fact, we only received 1 project over $20 million. This quarter's bookings were driven primarily by aftermarket, MRO and small project work, including numerous awards in the $5 million to $10 million range across all regions and end markets. Following our 10th consecutive quarter with a book-to-bill that exceeds 1.0, Flowserve's $2.8 billion backlog currently leaves us well positioned to deliver revenue growth through 2024. Second quarter revenue grew 22.5% and approached $1.1 billion, driven by a better operating environment and significantly improved delivery performance. The process and operational improvements that we have made over the past year are now showing up in our financial results. From a profitability standpoint, we again delivered adjusted gross margins exceeding 30%. Gross margins improved year-over-year due to better price cost management, further manufacturing absorption and also from the avoidance of high frictional costs that we incurred throughout last year. We also expanded our year-over-year adjusted operating margins for the third consecutive quarter due to our ability to execute on the backlog while remaining vigilant with our overall cost structure. With our improved operating performance and the constructive outlook in our markets, we are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $1.85 to $2. Turning to our bookings in more detail. Our strong performance this quarter was primarily driven by record aftermarket bookings of over $590 million, representing a 12% increase over the prior year. Original equipment bookings also increased by a modest 0.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by MRO and small project work, reflecting the previously mentioned absence of any large orders. We continue to expect the overall environment for original equipment to remain supportive as our project funnel over the next 12 months is up nearly 20% since the beginning of the year. Several years of underinvestment, coupled with the relatively high utilization rates at our customers' facilities has served as the catalyst for the strength in our aftermarket and MRO business. This reasonably stable, recurring and higher margin type of work is further supported by operators looking to ensure the reliability and efficiency of their facilities with a primary focus on reducing the likelihood of any unplanned downtime. At this time, we see no signs of our MRO or aftermarket business slowing down. Each of our core end markets delivered solid year-over-year growth with the exception of chemical. In general industries, bookings were up 20% and oil and gas was up 12%, while power and water were both up in the 2% to 3% range. Following 10 consecutive quarters of year-over-year constant currency bookings growth, our chemical bookings saw a year-over-year decline in the quarter of 11%, which was due to the challenging compare period as last year's second quarter bookings were near all-time high levels. From a regional perspective, all of our reported regions were up year-over-year. We continue to expect that our end markets will remain constructive over the foreseeable future. Based on the current environment, we believe that we are likely in the early stages of a multiyear up cycle supported by the combination of energy security and energy transition, which aligns perfectly with our 3D strategy. We further expect aftermarket and MRO levels to remain elevated for the remainder of 2023 and into 2024. As mentioned previously, our project funnel remains solid and represents significant opportunity for our traditional markets, particularly in the Middle East as well as for decarbonization investment, including increased nuclear activity, LNG capacity additions and carbon capture opportunities. Let me now turn the call over to Amy to address our second quarter financial results in greater detail.Amy B. SchwetzThanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our financial results in greater detail. We are very pleased with our performance and with the continued execution improvements in both our segments during the period. In the second quarter, we delivered $0.52 of adjusted EPS on revenue of nearly $1.1 billion, which is our highest level of sales since 2015. The strong results we've produced in the first 6 months of 2023, coupled with the operating momentum we have demonstrated over the last several quarters provide us confidence in our ability to execute on our sizable backlog to drive year-over-year revenue and earnings' growth in the second half of the year and also set us up well for 2024. On a reported basis, our earnings per share for the quarter was $0.39, primarily impacted by realignment and FX charges. Velan acquisition costs and additional charges related to a previously reserved sales contract comprise the remainder. Together, these expenses resulted in a total of $0.13 of adjusted items. Our second quarter revenue increased over 22% year-over-year with contributions virtually in all areas. Original equipment and aftermarket revenues increased roughly 26% and 20%, respectively, compared to the prior year. At the segment level, FPD contributed original equipment and aftermarket growth of 34% and 20%, respectively, while FCD delivered both original equipment and aftermarket growth in the 18% to 19% range. From a regional perspective, revenues increased across the globe year-over-year with notable strength in the Middle East and Africa region as well as in Latin America, where sales were up 56% and 32%, respectively, while North America and Europe were up roughly 19% and Asia Pacific contributed 7% growth. Turning to margins. We delivered solid year-over-year improvement again this quarter. Adjusted gross margin increased 190 basis points to 30.3%. This increase was driven by the strong volume leverage produced by our operational execution, a greater contribution derived from our recent price increases and an improving supply chain environment. The positive tailwinds were partially offset by the continued recognition of lingering lower-margin backlog that was booked in tough market conditions. In addition, we are seeing the impact of increased compensation expense due to our annual merit increase and higher year-over-year performance-based expense accruals, reflecting our results this year compared to 2022. All in, we are very pleased to have delivered 30%-plus gross margins in the first half of the year, which is a level we believe we can sustain for the back half of 2023 and look to grow from in the future. Going forward, our actions and initiatives are designed to maintain a high level of gross margin performance. This includes increasing the margin profile of work coming into backlog, continuing to improve our execution on the shop floor and implementing on our previously announced $50 million cost-out program, which includes a comprehensive organizational redesign to improve accountability, speed, product focus, planning competencies and our ability to address changes in the business outlook more quickly. On a reported basis, second quarter gross margins increased 160 basis points to 29.9%, where the improvements previously discussed were partially offset by a $4 million increase in adjusted items, primarily due to higher realignment charges versus prior year. Second quarter SG&amp;A increased $27 million to $219 million, primarily due to increased performance-based compensation accruals compared to last year as well as a higher level of R&amp;D investment to further expand our 3D product offerings, partially offset by a $4 million reduction of costs associated with the discrete legal matter. Most importantly, adjusted SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales decreased 150 basis points to 20.2% as we successfully leveraged our higher revenue level and realized some of the early benefits from our 2023 cost-out plan. Except for the occasional fourth quarter, this quarter's SG&amp;A percentage is the lowest level we have delivered since 2015. As we grow revenues and maintain our cost focus, we would expect to be in this range or better. On a reported basis, second quarter SG&amp;A increased $35 million to $230 million. In addition to the items just mentioned, the reported amount also included an $8 million increase in adjusted items, primarily due to a $7 million increase in realignment expense compared to prior year and $3 million related to the Velan transaction. Despite the increased year-over-year amounts, reported SG&amp;A as a percent of sales declined 80 basis points to 21.3%. Our second quarter adjusted operating margin increased 320 basis points to 10.4%, reflecting our strong operational performance, less frictional costs and ongoing SG&amp;A control. At the segment level, strong performance at FPD and FCD delivered adjusted segment operating margins of 13.2% and 13.3%, respectively. This represents year-over-year improvement of 380 and 80 basis points, respectively. Second quarter reported operating margin increased 210 basis points year-over-year to 8.9%, where significant operating leverage was partially offset by the $13 million increase in adjusted items versus the prior year. Our adjusted tax rate was 26% in the second quarter. This is much higher than our full year guidance range and was primarily due to the geographical mix of income and the timing related to certain foreign tax credits. Considering the second quarter's rate, we now expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 20%. Turning to cash flow. We are pleased with the first half operating cash flow of $50 million, especially since the first half of the year is traditionally challenged. With our performance in the first 6 months of 2023, we have produced a $122 million improvement versus the first half of last year, which is primarily due to our higher earnings' level and a $90 million year-over-year reduction in cash used for working capital. We delivered a year-over-year improvement from an inventory perspective as well. Inventory, including contract assets and liabilities for the first half was a use of $78 million versus the prior year use of $95 million. Despite the significant increase in revenues, we delivered a $16 million decrease in cash used for receivables. So I'm pleased with our collection efforts, which produced a modest improvement in our days sales outstanding. We will continue to focus on improving our cash conversion cycle, which has been necessarily challenged over the last several quarters by our rapidly growing backlog as well as an improving but still elevated lead times, causing some lingering challenges -- caused by some lingering challenges in the supply chain. As a percent of sales, primarily working capital supporting our recent bookings and backlog growth declined modestly 90 basis points on a sequential basis to 31.9%. While our backlog has increased over 20% since the second quarter of 2022, our inventory, including contract assets and liabilities as a percent of backlog has dropped 130 basis points to 30.7%. We will continue to focus near term on reducing our working capital investment to a level below 30% of sales, driven by supply chain improvements and our more consistent and predictable execution. In addition to working capital, other significant uses of cash in the second quarter included $26 million in dividends, $17 million in capital expenditures and a $10 million term loan debt reduction. As pleased as we are with the year-over-year improvement in free cash flow during the first half of 2023, we continue to expect our traditional cash flow phasing this year as that will produce the vast majority of this year's free cash flow and a seasonally strong second half, primarily in the fourth quarter. Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect to continue our recent healthy operating performance, further capitalize on supportive end markets and deliver solid second half adjusted operating margins and adjusted earnings per share. Additionally, we remain on track to achieve $50 million of full year run rate cost savings by the end of the year through our organizational optimization strategy. As a result of the actions taken in the first half of the year, we have achieved roughly $16 million of full year run rate savings and are already seeing wins through the new organizational design, including more efficient streamlined processes, better accountability and increased focus on our product and service offerings. With our near-record backlog of $2.8 billion in constructive end-market environment, we now expect to deliver revenue growth in the 16% to 18% range, including a modest currency benefit given the weakening of the U.S. dollar since the year began. We have also increased our full year expected adjusted EPS range to $1.85 to $2, which incorporates our strong first half results and our expectations for a solid second half of the year. The midpoint of our range represents a year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS of 75%. Of further note, our guidance metrics, including the revenue and adjusted EPS target ranges do not include any impact from the expected acquisition of Velan. Our adjusted targets also exclude identified realignment expenses of approximately $40 million as well as potential items that may occur during the year, such as below-the-line foreign currency effects and the impact of other discrete items, such as acquisitions, divestitures, additional realignment opportunities, special initiatives, tax reform laws, et cetera. Including the identified realignment spending and our other first half adjustments, we continue to expect our reported EPS in the range of $1.40 to $1.65. Both the reported and adjusted EPS target range also assumes recent foreign currency rates, reasonably stable commodity prices, no significant geopolitical disruptions and expectations for the end market environment to remain supportive at the current levels. We also expect net interest expense of approximately $60 million and an adjusted full year tax rate of approximately 20%. Finally, in terms of phasing for the remainder of the year and considering our expected shipping cadence, we expect our third quarter adjusted earnings to align closer to our first quarter results, but we expect to finish the year with a robust seasonally strong fourth quarter. Our updated range reflects the positive momentum we have created over the last 3 quarters and increased confidence in our planning and execution. Let me now return the call to Scott.Robert Scott RoweThanks, Amy. Let me finish our prepared remarks by discussing our 3D strategy and our outlook for the remainder of the year. As our results indicate, the 3D strategy has been successful to date and embraced by our associates and our customers. Flowserve is well positioned to diversify into promising growth markets and digitize our installed base while also supporting our traditional customers in their decarbonization commitments and new energy ventures. Looking at each of the pillars of the 3Ds and starting with our diversification efforts. Water is one of the markets we are targeting. During the second quarter, we received 3 water project awards totaling nearly $25 million. Another example of diversification is growing our vacuum technology into additional end markets. Recently, a global solutions provider for the food and feed markets selected SIHI's liquid ring vacuum technology to support the processing of edible oils and fats used in food and dairy alternatives. Flowserve solution will reduce their operating costs, CO2 emissions and total energy usage. While this is only one illustration in the second quarter, our vacuum pump bookings grew nearly 40% year-over-year as we continue to reposition the technology in new and attractive end markets. From a decarbonization perspective, our bookings remain strong, including record energy transition bookings in the quarter as well as solid contribution from the nuclear markets, where we booked 2 North American projects totaling $12 million. We remain very optimistic about the outlook for nuclear awards as countries increasingly focus on providing clean and reliable energy. Our current nuclear funnel is roughly double that amount it was at this time last year. Our strong nuclear portfolio of pumps, valves and seals supports facilities across the globe and Velan's offering will only further expand our nuclear valve capabilities. For decarbonization, I want to highlight our participation of planned expansion of a renewable products refinery. This project is expected to nearly double the facility's existing production capability for sustained aviation fuel and renewable diesel fuel utilizing Flowserve's valve and pump technology. Finally, on digitize, we continue to make progress deploying Red Raven, our IoT offering and are now monitoring nearly 2,000 assets in over 70 customer facilities. Through the combination of new customers and renewals, we are growing this offerings reach at nearly twice the rate of last year. We are committed to increasing the instrumentation of our installed base of pumps, valves and seals to support our customers' monitoring needs as well as providing predictive maintenance analytics and flow loop optimization. We believe that offering digitization capabilities will further position Flowserve to be a valued strategic partner by providing ongoing solutions to help minimize unplanned downtime and optimize their various flow loops. Flowserve was recently awarded contracts at 3 chemical facilities in Europe to monitor pumps, blowers, fans and mechanical seals with Red Raven's technology. I am confident that our technology will significantly improve the efficiency of these assets while allowing our customers to better monitor and plan their overall operations. During the second quarter, Flowserve released our 2022 ESG report. While this report provides great examples of our progress in each of these categories, it also provides an accurate depiction of who we are and what we stand for at Flowserve. It truly captures the essence of our culture and our ambition to make a difference in the world through innovative flow control technology. We have categorized our ESG program within the context of 3 Cs: culture, climate and core responsibility. Additionally, our report highlights how our 3D growth strategy is in full alignment with our ESG objectives. I encourage everyone to review the full report, and you can find it featured on our website at flowserve.com. Before I close, I want to provide a brief update on the Velan transaction. At this point, we have received all the necessary regulatory approvals with the exception of the French government. We are working diligently with the French authorities, but at this time, we do not have a clear view on their approval time line. We do expect to have better visibility into a path for closing the transaction in the near future. We remain excited about the combination with Velan and we are committed to working through the process to get to closing. Finally, I couldn't be more pleased with our progress this year, and I am encouraged by our results that we have achieved thus far in 2023. Despite our progress, there is more work to be done. We have further opportunities to drive margin expansion, continue to improve operations and ensure that we have the best possible portfolio for today's environment. This is only the beginning, and I am confident that Flowserve is positioned for additional success in the second half of this year and beyond. We are pleased to share that Flowserve will hold an Analyst Day in New York City in late September. At the event, we will provide an update on our markets, our 3D growth strategy, technology developments, long-range financial targets and our capital allocation framework. We will issue a press release in the coming weeks with further details. In closing, I want to thank our associates for their efforts, which enabled us to deliver an outstanding second quarter. Together, we have made great progress on our operations in executing our 3D strategy. I remain confident in our ability to maintain our momentum and drive further improvements throughout the year. Our focus remains on converting our $2.8 billion backlog, pursuing accelerated growth through our 3D strategy and driving higher margins and earnings by leveraging support of end markets, operational improvements and our new organizational design. I'm confident that executing this approach will deliver long-term value for all of Flowserve's stakeholders. Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks, and we like -- and we would now like to open the call to questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions)And we will go ahead and take our first question from Nathan Jones with Stifel.Nathan Hardie JonesMaybe starting off with one on the guide. 3Q looks a lot like 1Q would imply that 4Q looks a lot like 4Q last year. I would have thought you had some tailwinds going on in terms of better pricing coming out of the backlog, maybe a better mix with all of these aftermarket bookings. Do you feel like there's still a degree of conservatism, which is understandable after the last couple of years baked into the guidance here?Amy B. SchwetzSure. Thanks for the question, Nathan. I'll start with this. I would say, overall, our philosophy on guidance this year has certainly been not to anticipate that everything goes exactly perfectly as we make our way through the course of the year. And we certainly have a backlog in place that allows us to perform really strongly. As we think about second half incrementals, we think they're going to look a lot like the first half of the year, but that will be divided pretty heavily between -- or divided pretty starkly between the 2 quarters with incrementals looking fantastic in the third quarter as we have a relatively easy compare and then tightening in the fourth quarter of the year. Really, the third quarter performance this year as we sequence from the second quarter to the third quarter has to do with some traditional things that we see between the second and the third quarter. I think the first is really around holidays in the Western Hemisphere. The second is around some revenue that we pulled forward and accelerated into the second quarter of this year. And the third is really around uncertainty of some of the timing of the actuarial liabilities that we true up in the third quarter of this year. So that kind of marks where we're seeing the third quarter in comparison to the second quarter.Nathan Hardie JonesAnd then maybe as my follow-up question, we'll talk about gross margins. It's good to see them getting back to this consistent 30% level. Again, you should have some tailwinds over the next 18 months as some of this backlog converts from better absorption, from better pricing coming out, probably some operational improvement that you've demonstrated here in the second quarter. Can you maybe talk a bit more about the medium-term outlook for gross margins and where you think they might be able to get to?Amy B. SchwetzYes. So we definitely see that this year is sort of a stabilizing year from a gross margin perspective with the opportunity to really grow beyond that 30% range. And you hit on some of the key factors that I think we see as the short- to medium-term levers that we're pulling to both stabilize and grow margins, starting with working off at lower margin projects that have been in the backlog for the past several quarters, getting to where we need to be from a price cost perspective and seeing those pricing increases actually flow through into our results. And then finally, getting better operating leverage and absorption through the higher revenue levels that we've seen in the last several quarters. I think whether you want to call it medium to longer term, we still see that there are large levers for us to pool and some of which we really put this new organizational structure in place to be able to pull on. And I'd start there with improved capabilities from a product management perspective and the ability and the willingness to rationalize our product offering. And then finally, making roof line moves as permitted to really continue to make our way down the cost curve and grow those margins. And I think I just put in another plug for our Investor Day and say one of the things that we're excited about doing in September is offering more insight into our long-term targets and our levers to achieve them.Robert Scott RoweAnd then, Nathan, just to put it in perspective, right, we've said this before. We're very much focused on getting back to 2019 levels. And so that's our near-term focus. We want to get the gross margins at 32%, 33%. And as Amy laid out, those short-term activities get us to that. And then there's still some levers beyond that with the product rationalization and the roof line that can drive us ahead. And so we feel confident in our ability to deliver the year with good margins, and then we feel very good about the path to continuing to expand margins in 2024 and beyond.OperatorWe'll go ahead and take our next question from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen.Joseph Craig GiordanoI have like kind of like a multipartner on energy transition and then a quick one on Velan to follow up. So I'll start, energy transition like bookings for the year, how big do you think that can be? And like how big is nuclear? I don't think you combine nuclear into energy transition, right? So maybe if you could size both of those things.Robert Scott RoweYes. The energy transition, we categorize energy transition and new energy together, and that was $54 million in the quarter, and that's the highest that we've had thus far. And so we're pretty excited about that category. And generally, what would be in there is some of the like carbon capture, hydrogen and other things. And so we're pretty confident that we can continue to grow that. We're excited about what we see there. On the new player front, it's similar, right? We booked $50 million of nuclear work in Q2. That's a good number for us. And what I would say, we see that outlook in our funnel right now has doubled. And so we have good visibility to future work. We've got a really nice portfolio with nuclear, and that's both on the pumps and valve side, and we've got some strategic initiatives that will help us not only on the traditional power but on some of the small modular reactors in the new nuclear as well. And so this is a growth area that we're very excited about. We see opportunities in Eastern Europe. We see opportunities in Western Europe. We see opportunities in Asia, predominantly in India. And then where -- what we see in the Americas is really around life extensions. And with our installed base within nuclear, both on the valve and pump side, any time there's an extension of life for the nuclear facility, we get substantial aftermarket work. So this is something we'll talk more about in the Investor Day. We'll talk more as we go forward, but it's an area that we're very excited about for the future.Joseph Craig GiordanoAnd then what is the company like Exxon potentially talking about becoming like a massive lithium monitor, I mean for a company like yours? And then just a follow-up on Velan. Is there something in France, like I've heard that they maybe have like a piece of business that's like relative to the total.Robert Scott RoweLet me talk on the lithium mining. And so any time there's mining, there's substantial water involved, and we've got pumps and valves that work in the mining application handling water. And so especially on the lithium, it is a high water mining operation. And so we're pretty excited about what we see in the funnel in terms of providing the high-efficiency pumps in the lithium mines plus some of the valve work and then the mechanical steels as well. And so that's only opportunities. And I'd just say part of the energy transition, right, as folks are looking to more of these battery and these rare earth minerals to provide the energy storage, we see a lot of work in the funnel for this type of activity. And then on Velan, I said it in the prepared remarks, we're working with all the authorities around the world. We've gotten approvals everywhere with the exception of France. It's a difficult process in France. We're working with the Defense Ministry, the energy ministry, it's not necessarily anti-competitive. It's more about national security and the way France is moving forward. And so we're going to work diligently with them. We're answering all of your questions. We are very hopeful that we can get through this, but we are committed to the process, and we'll continue to answer questions and hopefully, in the next -- the coming weeks, we'll be able to provide more clarity towards target closing.OperatorAnd our next question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.Deane Michael DrayI might have missed this, but you were emphasizing the absence of big projects in the quarter. Did you miss any just -- was there not that many to bid on? Was there any selectivity kind of your win rate there? Just some color for starters.Robert Scott RoweSure. We actually see a substantial amount of project work. And I would say with the backlog that we have and the margin expectations, we're being very selective on, one, what we bid on and then two, what margins that we -- you are prepared to win. And so we are looking at it at a balanced approach, right? Typically, these big projects are highly engineered work. They give us a lot of good aftermarket. We've got a better formula to make sure that we get the returns that we want. But again given the MRO activity so strong and the absorption where we are in our plans, we're not going to get overly aggressive on this work, but our funnel is substantial. We've got visibility to a lot of this. And I'm not saying we're walking away from it, but we're getting a lot smarter about what we want to win and how we create value with those awards. So I'm optimistic that we will see some larger awards throughout the year but we're not going to over rotate here and take work that doesn't bring the calories that we believe we deserve for the effort that it takes to perform these big projects.Deane Michael DrayAll right. I love hearing the selectivity angle. So that sounds good. And then on the other side, on aftermarket being elevated, some perspective would be helpful here. So is this a result of overall industry activity being higher, capacity utilization being higher? Or are you winning more of your share? Or is it a combination, was there some deferred maintenance that now you're getting that opportunity? So some perspective there, if you could?Robert Scott RoweSure, Deane. Yes, the aftermarket bookings at 591 are at record levels are up 12% year-over-year. And it really is a combination of things. And what we're seeing is this underspend in the COVID year. So I think 2020 -- through 2020, kind of at the beginning of 2022, there's a lot of catch-up going on there. And then also, a lot of these assets are performing at really high utilization rates. And so as they're wearing through pumps, valves and seals, we're starting to pick up more work. And then finally, we've really put a lot of effort around what we call our services and solutions business, which is what supports the aftermarket. And so this is life cycle agreement contracts, this is a significant focus on lead time reduction in our coding lead time reduction and delivery of parts. And so this focus is now paying off. And so we call our win rate, we call our entitlement and what we're seeing is that our entitlement is actually coming up as we convert this higher level of work. And so we're winning more market share. There's more activity out there. And then the last point, and it's an important one, there is substantial work around compliance that's happening all over the globe. And so as different regulation comes through or a company changes their standards for emissions, then there's aftermarket opportunities for us. And so we see that in the seal side, we see it in valves, we see it in pumps as well. And so some of this change in regulation in company standards is also helping to drive our aftermarket growth. And just before I get off the topic, I'd just say we track this on a daily and a weekly basis. We've got good visibility to that aftermarket work around the world. And at this point, we're not seeing any signs of slowdown and so we'll continue to be vigilant about that. But we -- at this point, we firmly believe that we can keep this level of activity going for the foreseeable future.Deane Michael DrayAll right. That's all good to hear. And just one quick follow-up is what you have not said today, like some of your industrial peers, you haven't pointed to some destocking going on, either at the OE or at the distributor level. Are you seeing any of that? Obviously, it's not showing up in your numbers. You're not -- it's not in the commentary, but any color there would be helpful.Robert Scott RoweSure. Yes. I think the distributors -- it's always a little bit of a game there, right? And it all depends on our lead times. And so when our lead times are short, they can keep less on their shelves. When our lead times are long, they've got to stock up and have the inventory for their customers. And so there's a bit of a balance there. Lead times globally are coming down, which is going to allow distributors to destock a bit. At the same time, our distribution bookings have been incredibly healthy last year and into the beginning of this year. And I really don't see that as a massive headwind for us. I think there -- it might be flat for a little bit, but the overall activity through our distribution channel has been really good. And so -- and then you look at our general industry bookings, they're up substantial year-over-year. A lot of that was driven by some kind of unique project work that we picked up, but overall distribution is hanging in there, and I wouldn't see that as a substantial headwind as we go forward.OperatorOur next question will come from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.Sabrina Lee AbramsIt's Sabrina Abrams on for Andrew Obin. Could you guys give some color on the profitability for the decarbonization and clean energy projects? Would these have the same profile as maybe traditional EPC contracts or because their tax credits involved, does it sort of come in at a better margin?Robert Scott RoweNo. Right now, that work is pretty much on par with the rest of our portfolio. And I would say more in kind of that general industrial type work rather than the highly engineered oil and gas work. And so we like the margins there. What I will say is some of the projects attract a lot of attention, as you could expect, and folks want to tell a good story there. And so sometimes we're seeing a little bit more pressure on price, but I'd say a good bar for that would be at least at the margins that you're seeing for SCD and FPD, sometimes a bit higher. And then if it's a flagship project, it might be a little bit lower just because there's more people attractive -- or attracted to the project. What I will say is what we're very, very focused on is trying to select a handful of operators that are leading in the energy transition. By doing that, we can work with them more upfront and select Flowserve at the very beginning. And what we're finding when we're doing that is we get slightly higher margins. But more importantly, we're locked in through the design and the development, and we've got a front row seat to whatever that capability or that process is. So whether it's carbon capture or hydrogen or recyclables, we're in the middle of understanding what the flow loop requirements are. And so that approach is working well. We feel like we're winning more of our share in the decarbonization. And I would expect as we continue to learn more, we'll be able to get higher margins, both in the original equipment and in the aftermarket.Amy B. SchwetzAnd I'd just add to that. I think the goal behind these projects is to make them scalable and repeatable. And that works for us as well as we're able to continue to repeat that design and get better and better at the manufacturing process, it goes along. That helps us with margins over time.Sabrina Lee AbramsGreat. And then I think last quarter and throughout like the past several quarters, you've commented on seeing margins in the backlog improve and getting better. Is this still on an upward trend where the products you're currently booking have a better profile than what's currently in the P&amp;L?Amy B. SchwetzThat's what we see happening. And it's happening in 2 ways. One, just the release of some of these lower-margin projects from the backlog over time, and that's happening pretty ratably over the course of 2023. And the other thing that's happening in addition to just the overall environment being more constructive is the mix that we're talking about as we look at aftermarket and original equipment being one that's favorable overall to the margins in our backlog as well. So we do view that as something that sets us up well, both coming into the back half of the year, but more importantly, as we transition into 2024.OperatorNext question will come from Michael Halloran with Baird.Michael Patrick HalloranSo can you just talk a little bit more about the project funnel and how you see it laying out? Obviously, the commentary on the nuclear side and the confidence or the growing confidence you see in the energy transition piece that makes a lot of sense. So if you look at some of the more traditional pieces of your business, can you just talk to how you think that project funnel is developing in the marketplace? And if you think things are still being added or if there's any hesitancy growing anywhere in that chain?Robert Scott RoweThe project funnel was good, and I said this in the prepared remarks, we've seen the project funnel grow year-to-date. We're above where we were last year with the project funnel. And last year, the funnel included the Jafurah project at $200 million plus. And so we think -- we like what the project funnel is showing us. And then in terms of kind of areas where we've seen substantial growth, nuclear is up significantly. LNG is up significantly and then the whole decarbonization and new energy is up significantly. From a regional perspective, the Middle East is the highest, and we're seeing significant opportunities in the Middle East. And then we're seeing -- and those would be more traditional, both the downstream refinery and the chemical business. And then in Asia, we still have good visibility to new projects, but those are more competitive and harder to win than what we have in the Middle East or in North America. And so overall, I'd say it's reasonably well balanced between some of the new stuff and what we've seen in a traditional fashion. And again, I feel confident in our ability to win. And I feel like as the market continues to move forward, the pricing dynamic will get better, and we'll start to see more wins on the OE side. But right now, we're in a good position. The backlog allows us to be more selective. We're being disciplined in that approach, but I feel like we can continue to grow OE into next year and beyond.Michael Patrick HalloranAnd a follow-up to part of the end of the question there, which is just the pricing piece. Obviously, you feel comfortable about how you guys are managing your pricing, I think we can see it in your backlog commentary. When you think about the end market dynamics or the marketplace dynamics, you mentioned you hope pricing can get a little better as we progress here. Are you seeing that happen anywhere at this point? Or is this literally just you are being selective in the pricing? Or are we getting to the point where there's enough capacity utilization from an industry perspective that you're seeing a little bit of softening in some of that competitiveness?Robert Scott RoweYes. We have seen a substantial improvement year-over-year in pricing. I'd say the whole industry is behaving and performing better. We would still like to see more improvement as we go forward. And there are still pockets that are highly selective. And so if there's a flagship project out there that might have the energy transition associated with it or something in the Middle East that could provide lots of aftermarket, we're still seeing some pricing that wouldn't make sense given where we are in the cycle. But I would say, overall, it's substantially better than last year and I would expect it to improve from this point forward.OperatorThe next question will come from Damian Karas with UBS.Damian KarasYou sound extremely confident in next year. So maybe just playing devil's advocate a bit, thinking about some of the macro trends, things like PMIs and maybe territory. What would it take to disrupt that growth through 2024? Maybe if you could just kind of talk about some of the key risks? And are you thinking that bookings kind of flat line from here and you're getting that continued sales expansion for your backlog and projects? Or are you kind of expecting you can continue to grow bookings into next year?Robert Scott RoweBookings revenue and margins as we think about 2024. Right now, kind of based on the commentary and the outlook in the project funnel and where our aftermarket and MRO is, we expect modest bookings increase in 2024. I don't think you're going to see what we saw last year, that 15-plus percent across the board, I think we're going to see modest growth. And the activity is there. And I think we've been pretty selective on some of this bigger work. And we have the ability to go down. But at this point, there's no reason to do that to win more work given where the backlog is. And so I feel like we can go forward with the OE side, and I don't see the MRO and aftermarket going down either given the utilization rates in some of the -- what I said before on the compliant changes in the regulatory environment. Now what could go wrong? I mean, anything that's driving a hard recession or a change in the outlook of the economy obviously impacts his business. And so could that happen? Sure. At this point though, given the pullback in 2022 or 2020 and 2021, I just don't see that given the substantial underinvestment in these end markets. And so I think there's growth for us for the next couple of years. We can see that in the general indices out there. A lot of the oil and gas companies have talked about their willingness and need to spend. We're seeing it in the international side. And then when we think about the 2 big drivers for us right now, it's this energy security, which nations and countries are desperate to secure their energy source, that's number one. And then the decarbonization effort, that's number two. And so I don't see either of those reversing course and I think there's only going to be more investment to make sure that they can secure their energy and then decarbonize existing assets. So I feel good about it. And then when we look about -- let's go to revenue for 2024. Again, we're positioned pretty well there, given the backlog that we have and the ongoing bookings. Bookings would have to decline pretty substantially. I'm looking at Amy for a number here. I'm not going to throw out a number, but they'd have to come down pretty significantly from where we are today, cannot have revenue growth in 2024. And so we feel like in multiple environments, we still grow the company into 2024. And then Amy laid out our margins, right? And so again, we feel we're very well positioned both in the short term and the medium and long term to continue to drive gross margin expansion into 2024. And I won't walk through the list that she mentioned earlier. But right now, we feel like we're as well positioned as any of the peer group in terms of being able to drive bookings' growth, revenue growth and margin performance into 2024.Amy B. SchwetzYes. Damian, I'd just use it as a data point that when we started the year with a smaller backlog than we have today. We had guided initially to 6% to 8% revenue growth, and we had a number of people point out that, that decline -- or that, that implied a negative kind of book and burn business in terms of -- from a growth perspective in 2023. So the backlog is really gives us a lot of insight into what 2024 can and should look like kind of regardless of the macro environment at that point in time, and it's our job to capitalize on that.Damian KarasGreat. Really appreciate all that. And times are pretty rosy right now. So just curious how you're thinking about managing the business, things like your staffing and headcount, investment levels. And I guess, just more generally, costs in your footprint, kind of just making sure that you don't get caught with your pants down the road when the tide does eventually turn.Robert Scott RoweSure. We've announced a $50 million cost-out program, as we said in the prepared remarks that we're still on track to deliver that. And that is kind of the recession-proofing. And so there's opportunities to align our cost structure with some of the things that we think. And then we've done the significant reorganization that we launched at the beginning of this year. And the new reorganization is really intended to focus more at the product level and the business unit level and support our 3D strategy. And so part of the realignment here is to really get the organization fully align with the 3D strategy. But then on the positive side, it helps us not only on the margins, but it helps to think about and being preserved for the future there. So that's in place. We're committed to that moving forward. In fact, a lot of that work has already been done.OperatorOur next question will come from Brett Linzey with Mizuho.Brett Logan LinzeyI wanted to come back to the project funnel. So just suggesting it's heavier aftermarket versus OE. I guess, first, is that the case? And then what is the typical lag between something that enters the funnel to an order to a shipment, and then just to follow up off that.Robert Scott RoweYes. Just to be clear, when we talk about the project funnel, that really is the OE work. It doesn't necessarily include any of our aftermarket business. And so the optimism there was really on the OE side and the project side. And we've got kind of a threshold that there's only projects that are x million dollars in there or higher. And so this is really a nice barometer or an index for the larger EPC-type work that we see out there. And so again, we feel good about that, that funnel is up year-on-year without the Jafurah project, and we've seen a substantial increase since the beginning of the year.Amy B. SchwetzAnd when we talk about the funnel, we are seeing about a subset of the funnel, which we believe will book within the next 12 months.Brett Logan LinzeyYes. Makes sense. And then just back to the organizational redesign. I was hoping you could spend a little more time around the streamlining the efficiency efforts and is there a way to frame in dollar terms or margin terms, what the enablement will be over time here?Robert Scott RoweSure. I'd say the enablement and what it's going to give us, we'll do that at the Analyst Day. So that will -- we're going to hit that head on and commit to some longer-term targets and exactly what could be attributed to the reorg. But the reorg itself, fundamentally, what it did is it took us to 2 major divisions. In the past, we had 3 leaders that one was leading the aftermarket business. But what we did below that, which is really important, we now have 7 business units with business unit leaders. And so think about like the business unit would be industrial pumps, our seal business, the engineered isolation valve business is now a vertical and -- with a VPG and leader. .And so before -- as we went through Flowserve 2.0, we had a pretty heavy structure at the corporate level, truly defining process and standards around the organization. And now as we evolve to this new organization, we can slim down the corporate functions in terms of process and control. What we're now doing is really putting the honest and the accountability level at the 7 BUs across the organization. So we're really excited about what it brings. It's a more customer-focused organization, and then it drives simplicity across the entire Flowserve enterprise. It drives accountability for our results and then it will lend itself to some cost out that we talked about previously.OperatorOur next question will come from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi.Unidentified AnalystThis is (inaudible) behalf of Andy. You guys touched on seeing good investments across recyclable and circular economy, we're definitely hearing more about this. So maybe can you comment on how impactful or how big of an end market can this be for Flowserve?Robert Scott RoweSure. We've been fortunate to participate in a lot of the early big wins on the recyclable side, and we've got some great partnerships, one that we announced is with Clariter that's truly doing a green recyclables back-to-base materials, including crude-grade oils and waxes. And so we've had a front row seat now, and it's interesting to watch this evolve but I would be reluctant at this point to say what the overall potential is, but we have is one of our 3 biggest growth opportunities within the decarbonization lane. And so we're very excited about it. It lends itself well to our portfolio of valves and pumps. And so when you're breaking down plastics, it requires high heat, there's a caustic component to it. And so it allows us to provide more of an engineered solution. And then as Amy said earlier, the other thing that we're doing with these companies is a lot of them are relatively small or early in their inception, and we're actually being -- we're helping them substantially scale their companies by helping them look at their flow control or their flow loop in terms of efficiency and using the right equipment and driving an optimal flow loop for the recycle process. So this is something that we're pretty excited about it. We will talk about it as an end market in the Investor Day. But at this point, I'm not prepared to talk about what the overall potential is because it's evolving so quickly.Unidentified AnalystGot it. Helpful, Scott. And lastly, on China, relatively small end market for you, but we have been hearing some cautious comments. So can you elaborate from Flowserve's perspective, what you're seeing in that region?Robert Scott RoweYes. I think cautious is probably a good word for China right now. It's not a huge part of our overall business, but it is a business that we'd like to continue to grow and be involved in. But I would say this emerging from COVID, we had some higher activity last year. It's kind of flatlined thus far this year. We do have visibility to some larger projects. But right now, we're seeing those get slid to the right and delayed a bit. So I'd just say relatively cautious view on the Chinese end market. But overall, Asia Pacific for us, we still feel that we can grow our business there.OperatorAnd with that, that was our last question. That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to thank you for joining today's call. That does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

For fiscal 2024, the company anticipates revenues to be modestly down to flat year over year, driven by the persistent weakness in its wholesale business and a longer-than-expected turnaround for Vans. The company’s wholesale business, mainly in the U.S., remains challenging as its major partners are having a more cautious approach on forward orders. Vans performance is also concerning.However, the North Face and China business have been experiencing momentum. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is also seeing an improved performance in the supply chain, allowing it to capitalize on revenue opportunities. It has also been managing costs and inventory position. Overall, management expects a better second-half revenue performance with respect to the first half on improving wholesale performance, moderating declines at Vans and easing year-over-year comparisons.For fiscal 2024, the bottom line is envisioned to be $2.05-$2.25 per share.

This was partly negated by softness in the United States and Canada.The gross margin increased 140 basis points (bps) to 50.6%, mainly caused by reduced inbound ocean freight costs and favorable inventory provisions, somewhat offset by a rise in clearance and promotional activity.

To skip our detailed analysis of current market dynamics, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Bargain Stocks To Buy in August.Fitch Downgrades US Debt - AAA to AA+On August 2, Fitch Ratings downgraded the US credit rating from a long-held AAA to AA+ while holding a Stable Outlook. The downgrade came in light of the country's ""expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years, a high and growing general government debt burden, and the erosion of governance relative to 'AA' and 'AAA' rated peers over the last to decades,"" according to Fitch. In light of this downgrade, US markets have been down for the day. The S&amp;P 500 fell by 65.64 basis points, or 1.44%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 355.50 basis points, or 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite index fell by 316.56 basis points, or 2.22%, on August 2. While some are worried that this is signaling the end to the extended stock rally seen in the markets so far this year, others don't seem to be all too worried about the downgrade.On August 2, CNBC's Closing Bell showed a snippet from an earlier conversation with Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. According to Dimon, the Fitch downgrade ""doesn't really matter that much."" He also noted that while there are several countries now that are higher-rated than the US, these countries continue to live under the ""American military enterprise,"" highlighting that the US still retains its international dominance. Additionally, Liz Young, the head of investment at SoFi, also noted at CNBC's Closing Bell that this downgrade isn't a surprise, but it's also not a big deal for the US at present. The country very narrowly avoided a default two months ago, and the state of the markets and the economy continues to be volatile.Is A Pause In The Rally A Good Thing?However, this should not worry investors too much. According to Young, the pause in the stock market rally after the downgrade and the ensuing market pullback may even be healthy for the market in the long run. Finally, Josh Brown, the CEO, and co-founder of Ritholtz Wealth Management, also noted during the closing bell that before the downgrade, the average gains for the top 20 S&amp;P 500 stocks stood at around 83%, and these same stocks have fallen by about 3% on average after the Fitch downgrade. Brown believes that investors should consider this an opportunity to find stocks to go long on rather than pulling out of these companies entirely.Story continuesMost of the stocks that have been on the rise in the S&amp;P 500 so far this year include tech stocks, primarily, followed by other sectors such as consumer staples and healthcare, among more. Sectors like these that have largely been performing well in 2023 can serve as excellent investment opportunities at present since top-tier stocks in these areas are currently down. Investors can thus add these names to their portfolios at a bargain if they act fast and act smart. Companies like Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), and AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO), among several others, are considered to be some of the best bargain stocks in the market today, according to analysts. However, other stocks that have particularly begun falling in light of the Fitch downgrade may also be worth taking a look at right now. They may well be considered to be some of the best cheap stock options to buy today. Since the S&amp;P 500's top performers were the ones that took the biggest hits after the downgrade, picking them up now may also ensure that investors get some of the best stocks to buy and hold for 20 years or more. Considering the above, we have compiled a list of some good bargain stock options for investors heading into August.12 Best Bargain Stocks To Buy in AugustImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyTo select the stocks for our list, we used a stock screener to first find stocks with P/E ratios below 20.

Humana and Elevance Health were down during the quarter because of commentary from UnitedHealth Group Incorporated management indicating that medical cost trends were running at the high end of their guidance driven by higher levels of outpatient medical activity, particularly among Medicare patients. We think UnitedHealth, Humana, and Elevance will be able to manage through an uptick in medical cost trends, but we modestly reduced our positions in Humana and Elevance due to the potential impact on earnings.We continue to own UnitedHealth, Humana Inc., and Elevance Health, Inc. because we believe these companies will be able to manage through this period without a material earnings impact, but we did modestly reduce our positions in Humana and Elevance Health.”8.

Any number of examples between large cap tech companies and more mature companies could illustrate this very same point, but we find this specific case most interesting because of its history.Note that in late 2014/early 2015 these multiples crossed one another. The relative harmony between Alphabet and Autozone lasted for just shy of a year at that time, before Alphabet’s shares surged and Autozone’s shares slumped. This relationship need not matter for markets, though we think there is some signal for investors. Autozone today trades at the highest multiples of its recent history, while Alphabet trades at its lowest.

While buyers had fewer for-sale options, with active inventory 49.2% below typical pre-pandemic July levels, the market tipped slightly in their favor as the median list price declined year over year (-0.9% to $440,000) for the second month in a row.""While a second monthly year-over-year decline in list prices bodes well for potential buyers, the ongoing lack of homes available for sale continues to prop up home prices and will keep declines relatively modest for the remainder of the year,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""Interest rate hikes continue to further cut into buyers' purchasing power, although they appear to have adapted to the higher mortgage rate environment faster than sellers, many of whom are still on the sidelines, locked in to lower interest rates and unwilling to cash in their home's equity to purchase another. That's putting a damper on home sales, which will likely post their smallest annual tally this year in over a decade.""July 2023 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over July 2022Change over July 2019Median listing price-0.9% (to $440,000)+37.7 %Active listings-6.4 %-47.8 %New listings-20.8 %-27.1 %Median days on market+11 days (to 45 days)-12 daysShare of active listings with price reductions-3.6 percentage points (to 15.5%)-2.2 percentage pointsHome listing inventory crunch intensifies as fewer sellers enter the marketGrowth in the U.S. inventory of active listings slowed for four months in a row, and in July, declined compared to the previous year for the first time since early 2022. That means today's buyers have significantly fewer options to choose from compared to one year ago – on a typical day in July there were 45,000 fewer homes available to buy. With interest rates on track to remain elevated for the remainder of the year and homeowners choosing to sell in lower numbers than has been typical in recent years, the stock of homes for sale is expected to remain low in the coming months.Story continuesIn July, the U.S. inventory of active listings slowed for the fourth month in a row and decreased -6.4% compared to July 2022; the decline was the first since April 2022. Inventory is 49.2% below typical July pre-pandemic levels.Both newly listed homes (-20.8%) and pending listings (-12.6%), or homes under contract, declined year over year. July's decline in pending listings is smaller than June's -16.7% decline and much improved from December's peak decline (-36.9% year over year).Active inventory decreased in 38 out of 50 of the largest metros compared to last year. Only the Southern region saw inventory grow, up +2.8% year over year, led by New Orleans (+39.6%), San Antonio (+34.5%) and Memphis, Tenn. (+33.2%).In July, none of the 50 largest metro areas saw new listings increase over the previous year. Declines were greatest in Phoenix(-44.3%) Seattle (-38.4%) and San Jose, Calif. (-35.3%).Home listing prices decline but mortgage rates keep purchase costs highIn July, national median list prices declined slightly year over year for the second month in a row. Despite the dip, the low supply of homes for sale and a resilient labor market are expected to keep upward pressure on prices this year, as will still-high buyer demand. The housing market continues to generally move faster than it did in the pre-pandemic era despite significant slowing from the frenzied pace of the past few years; while time on market is up slightly from last year, the share of homes with price reductions is down from last July.For the second month in a row, the U.S. median list price declined slightly (-0.9% year over year) to $440,000 in July, down from $445,000 in June. The median list price is down -2.0% from its record high of $449,000 in June 2022.Higher mortgage rates compared to July of last year increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by roughly $346 (+17.5%) compared to a year ago.Nationally, the share of homes with price reductions decreased from 19.1% in July 2022 to 15.5% this year. The share of price reductions remains below typical levels seen in 2017 to 2019.The typical home spent 45 days on market in June, 11 days longer than this time last year, but 12 fewer days than they typically did in the average June 2017–2019.Across the 50 largest U.S. metros, in July the typical home spent 39 days on the market, 8 days more than the previous July. Time on market increased the most in Miami (+24 days), Austin, Texas (+20 days), San Antonio (+19 days), and Raleigh, N.C. (+19 days)Spotlight On: A rising number of buyers are looking for homes in other marketsWith rising rates and still-high home prices, the number of home shoppers searching for homes in areas other than where they live continues to rise. Realtor.com®'s Q2 Cross-Market Demand Report, also released today, found that Western shoppers are most likely to look for out-of-market homes, but Northeastern shoppers are catching up – that region saw the highest growth this quarter. While home shoppers show the greatest preference for searching for homes in nearby metros or states, long-distance home searching sometimes pairs unexpected cities, such as from San Francisco to Chicago and Chicago to Dallas. In Q2 2023, 60.3% of all Realtor.com® listing views from the Top 100 metros went to homes located outside the metro areas where shoppers live, up 0.7 percentage points from Q1 2023 and 4.1 percentage points year over year.Regionally, Western home shoppers (67.7%) were most likely to look for out-of-market homes in Q2, but Northeastern shoppers (59.9%) are catching up. Northeastern shoppers saw the highest growth in Q2, when the share of out-of-market shopping was 5.5 percentage points higher than the prior year.In all four regions, more than half of online shopping traffic went to homes outside of the shoppers' metro areas. Only the Western region had this level of outside shopping interest three years ago.Chicago has been the top out-of-state destination for home shoppers based in San Francisco for the past four quarters, likely because of its relatively affordable housing, similar tech/industry structure and easy access to transportation. Similarly, Dallas serves as the metro pair for Chicago for shoppers seeking tech jobs, easy air transportation and warmer weather.Tampa, Fla. is a metro pair for multiple metros in New York and Ohio, including Akron, Cincinnati and Cleveland in Ohio and Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse in New York. Las Vegas is urban Honolulu's metro pair, Phoenix is Portland, Ore.'s metro pair, and Miami is New York City's metro pair.""Housing affordability isn't likely to improve anytime soon, so it's not surprising to see that Americans are on the move and increasingly searching for homes in more affordable areas of the country where they can stretch their housing dollars further,"" said Jiayi Xu, Realtor.com®  Economist. ""Sellers are much more likely to see interest from out-of-towners than in years past, and from where that interest is coming might be the most surprising.""Views to Out-of-Metro Homes by RegionsShare of Outbound Views to Other Metros (2023Q2) Share of Outbound Views to Other Metros(2022Q2) YOYNortheast59.9 %54.4 %+5.5 pptMidwest55.0 %51.7 %+3.3 pptSouth58.8 %54.5 %+4.3 pptWest67.7 %64.3 %+3.4 pptTop 100 Metros60.3 %56.2 %+4.1 pptJuly 2023 Housing Overview by Top 50 Largest Metros Metro AreaMedian Listing PriceMedian Listing Price YoYMedian Listing Price per Sq.

The articles paint a picture of Mr. Heppner as a leader who exploited investors which, according to the lawsuit, includes falsehoods published with “actual malice.”A spokesperson for The Wall Street Journal, owned by News Corp, declined to comment as did Beneficient. News Corp has extensive ties to the Murdoch family including Rupert Murdoch who is executive chairman. The suit against Mr. Gladstone was filed by Clare Locke, a firm that sued Fox News in the voting machine scandal around the 2020 election that recently resulted in a $787.5 million settlement. Mr. Murdoch is also chair of Fox News parent Fox Corp. (The two companies split apart roughly a decade ago).Mr. Gladstone didn’t reply to a request for comment from IPO Edge.Story continuesOne aim of the lawsuit is to address a “false narrative” around legacy transactions, in particular an investment in the business from another company called GWG Holdings that was characterized as “Heppner’s takeover.” The suit says that the deal with GWG was made at arms length with approval from a special committee that didn’t include Mr. Heppner.The lawsuit says it was not Mr. Heppner’s deal as Mr. Gladstone suggests but was struck “as part of a larger strategy to diversify before Heppner became chairman of GWG’s board” at a time when Mr. Heppner “never had control or approval rights” and had no say in who was appointed to the GWG board.Furthermore, the suit says GWG invested in Beneficient “as part of a publicly disclosed business strategy, and GWG’s investment in Beneficient, at the time of Gladstone’s Article and tweet, was worth substantially more than the principal invested.”The suit goes on to emphasize that Beneficient attempted to share accurate information with Mr. Gladstone that he chose not to use. “When Gladstone asserted pre-publication that Beneficient ‘need[ed] to take that $230 million from GWG[,]’ he was explicitly contradicted by Plaintiffs’ representatives and warned the description was factually inaccurate—instead, the transaction described was an investment for value—and warned that the assertion that Beneficient ‘took’ money from GWG supported a false narrative,” the suit says.Beneficient is a technology-based platform designed to help medium-to-high net worth individuals and smaller institutions exit illiquid positions in alternative assets like private equity, which typically lock up investor money for a decade or so. Ben has taken steps to streamline the process so investors can apply for a quote entirely online – much like a car insurance quote on a standardized form. The tech allows Ben to offer liquidity in transactions as small as $100,000 – far below typical transactions that occur now.Needless to say, financial innovation can compel companies to navigate complex rules and regulations. Beneficient has two former Federal Reserve Presidents on its board: Richard Fisher of Dallas and Dennis Lockhart of Atlanta – both of whom have extensive experience in the world of money and banking.Contact: IPO-Edge.com Editor@IPO-Edge.com Twitter: @IPOEdge Instagram: @IPOEdge ]"

Adjusted net income was $295 million or $0.48 per diluted share. Net operating cash flow was $1,076 million or $1,121 million before changes in working capital (adjusted CFO). Free cash flow was $442 million or $531 million before changes in working capital and including Equatorial Guinea (E.G.) distributions and other financing (adjusted FCF).(PRNewsfoto/Marathon Oil Corporation)Continued delivery on commitment to return at least 40% of adjusted CFO to shareholdersAchieved strong second quarter financial and operational results with no changes to full-year production or capital spending guidance ranges""Second quarter adds to our track record of consistent execution against our well-established Framework for Success"" said Chairman, President, and CEO Lee Tillman. ""We built on our return of capital leadership, increasing shareholder distributions to over $430 million during second quarter, including over $370 million of share repurchases. Second quarter financial and operational results were again very strong, highlighted by notable increases to our cash flow, free cash flow, and production relative to the first quarter. We remain on track to deliver against our full year capital spending and production guidance with oil equivalent production trending above the midpoint. In summary, we remain well positioned to continue offering our investors top tier and sustainable free cash flow generation, an advantaged return of capital profile, and differentiated per-share growth with an investment grade balance sheet - all at an attractive valuation. I remain confident that our 2023 business plan is both resilient and compelling across a broad range of commodity prices and that it benchmarks at the very top of both the E&amp;P sector and the S&amp;P 500 on the metrics that matter most.""Story continuesReturn of CapitalMarathon Oil's percentage of CFO framework provides clear visibility to significant return of capital to equity investors, ensuring the shareholder gets the first call on cash flow generation and protecting shareholder distributions from capital inflation. In a $60/bbl WTI or higher price environment, the Company targets returning a minimum of 40% of CFO to equity investors. The Company remains on track to meet or exceed this minimum objective in 2023.During second quarter, Marathon Oil returned $434 million to shareholders, including $372 million of share repurchases and the $62 million base dividend. Through the first two quarters of 2023, Marathon Oil has returned $831 million to shareholders, representing 40% of adjusted CFO. Shareholder distributions through the first two quarters of 2023 include over $700 million of share repurchases and $125 million in base dividends.Since significantly increasing return of capital to equity investors in fourth quarter 2021 under its current Return of Capital Framework, Marathon Oil has returned $4.6 billion to shareholders, including $4.2 billion of share repurchases that have reduced outstanding share count by 24%, contributing to significant growth in all per-share metrics.2Q23 FinancialsCASH FLOW AND CAPEX: Net cash provided by operations was $1,076 million during second quarter or $1,121 million before changes in working capital. Second quarter cash additions to property, plant and equipment totaled $634 million, while capital expenditures (accrued) totaled $623 million.BALANCE SHEET AND LIQUIDITY: Marathon Oil ended second quarter with $215 million in cash and cash equivalents. The Company redeemed $131MM of 8.125% Senior Notes in July, bringing year-to-date gross debt reduction to $200 million. This followed the successful April remarketing of $200 million of tax-exempt bonds at an interest rate of 4.05% that matures in 2026. At quarter end, Marathon Oil had $2.1 billion of available borrowing capacity on its revolving credit facility that matures in 2027. All three primary credit rating agencies continue to rate Marathon Oil as investment grade, with Fitch and Moody's reaffirming their credit rating in June 2023.ADJUSTMENTS TO NET INCOME: The adjustments to net income for second quarter increased net income by $8 million, primarily due to a small unproved property impairment and the income impact associated with unrealized losses on derivative instruments.2Q23 OperationsUNITED STATES (U.S.): U.S. production averaged 356,000 net boed for second quarter 2023, an increase from 341,000 net boed during first quarter.

Unit production costs averaged $5.72 per boe, and net income from equity method investees totaled $22 million during second quarter. Second quarter production, unit costs, and equity income were all negatively impacted by a triennial turnaround completed during the month of April. Second quarter cash distributions from equity method companies totaled $249 million, including $215 million of dividends and $34 million of distributions classified as return of capital.2023 GuidanceMarathon Oil's originally provided 2023 production guidance ranges remain unchanged with the Company's full year 2023 total Company oil equivalent production trending above the midpoint of guidance. Third quarter total Company oil and oil equivalent production are both expected to be at or above the high end of the annual guidance ranges. No change to the Company's 2023 capital spending guidance range of $1.9 to $2.0 billion with first half capital spending (accrued) accounting for just over 60% of the full year budget at the midpoint of guidance, consistent with the Company's business plan.The Company's 2023 business plan continues to benchmark at the top of its high-quality E&amp;P peer group, as measured by expected shareholder distribution yield; FCF yield and FCF efficiency; capital efficiency; FCF breakeven; and growth in production per-share.A slide deck and Quarterly Investor Packet will be posted to the Company's website following this release.

Our presentation of adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted net income (loss) is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for gains or losses on dispositions, impairments of proved and certain unproved properties, changes in our valuation allowance, unrealized derivative gains or losses on commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, effects of pension settlements and curtailments and other items that could be considered ""non-operating"" or ""non-core"" in nature. Management believes this is useful to investors as another tool to meaningfully represent our operating performance and to compare Marathon to certain competitors. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) or net income (loss) per share as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Our presentation of adjusted CFO is defined as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for changes in working capital and is a non-GAAP measure. Management believes this is useful to investors as an indicator of Marathon's ability to generate cash quarterly or year-to-date by eliminating differences caused by the timing of certain working capital items. Adjusted CFO should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Our presentation of free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities and cash additions to property, plant and equipment. Management believes this is useful to investors as a measure of Marathon's ability to fund its capital expenditure programs, service debt, and fund other distributions to stockholders. Free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Our presentation of adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted free cash flow before dividend (""adjusted free cash flow"") is defined as adjusted CFO, capital expenditures (accrued), and EG return of capital and other financing. Management believes this is useful to investors as a measure of Marathon's ability to fund its capital expenditure programs, service debt, and fund other distributions to stockholders. Adjusted free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Our presentation of capital expenditures (accrued) is a non-GAAP measure. Capital expenditures (accrued) is defined as cash additions to property, plant and equipment adjusted for the change in capital accrual and additions to other assets. Management believes this is useful to investors as an indicator of Marathon's commitment to capital expenditure discipline by eliminating differences caused by the timing of capital accrual and other items. Capital expenditures (accrued) should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, cash additions to property, plant and equipment as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Our presentation of reinvestment rate is a non-GAAP measure. The reinvestment rate in the context of adjusted free cash flow is defined as capital expenditures (accrued) divided by adjusted CFO. The reinvestment rate in the context of free cash flow is defined as cash additions to property, plant and equipment divided by net cash provided by operating activities. Management believes the reinvestment rate is useful to investors to demonstrate the Company's commitment to generating cash for use towards investor-friendly purposes (which includes balance sheet enhancement, base dividend and other return of capital).These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the business that, when viewed with GAAP results may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the business and are a useful tool to help management and investors make informed decisions about Marathon Oil's financial and operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our investor package on our website at https://ir.marathonoil.com/ and in the tables below. Marathon Oil strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely on any single financial measure.Forward-looking StatementsThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

MSI is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 3, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 7.8%. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.9%, on average.The Chicago, IL-based company is expected to have recorded year-over-year higher revenues on the back of growth in both segments — Products and Systems Integration, and Services and Software. It benefits from the increasing demand for its mission-critical technologies in North America and globally.Factors at PlayDuring the quarter, Motorola announced that it reduced misrouted 9-1-1 calls for public safety answering points (PSAPs) by about 50% in Utah, enabling faster response time for people in distress. Leveraging the National Emergency Number Association i3-compliant 9-1-1 Next Generation Core Services call routing technology, the company has significantly improved emergency response to help save countless lives. The interoperable, resilient next-generation 9-1-1 systems are being increasingly deployed nationwide for faster emergency support. This is likely to have generated incremental revenues during the quarter.In second-quarter 2023, Motorola secured a contract from the City of London Police for its VB400 body-worn cameras in order to boost the security of police officers. The use of body-worn cameras improves transparency and accountability, which can foster trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. Advanced features of VB400 combined with the Pronto mobile digital policing platform will significantly improve real-time communication and collaboration, enhance the decision-making process and streamline the workflow.During the to-be-reported quarter, Motorola also secured a five-year contract from the Ministry of the Internal Administration of Portugal to maintain and enhance the country’s mission-critical public safety communications network. The agreement will facilitate 180 public safety agencies and 40,000 first responders, including police, fire and medical services, to benefit from a highly reliable and secure TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio) communications network.Riding on such state-of-the-art products, Motorola expects to record strong demand across video security and services, land mobile radio products and related software while benefiting from a solid foundation. These systems drive the demand for additional device sales and promote software upgrades and infrastructure expansion. The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks related to critical communications operations. These developments are expected to have positively impacted its performance in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Products and Systems Integration segment’s revenues is pegged at $1,424 million. The figure indicates a rise from $1,285 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for revenues from this segment stands at $1,399.4, implying 8.9% year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Services and Software segment’s revenues stands at $935 million, up from $855 million recorded in the year-earlier quarter. Our estimate for revenues from this segment stands at $956.8, suggesting 11.9% year-over-year growth.  For the June quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2,357 million, which indicates growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $2,140 million. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share stands at $2.51, which suggests an increase from $2.07 recorded in the prior-year quarter driven by top-line growth.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Motorola in the second quarter.

The leading wireless solutions provider reported lower revenues year over year due to a slowdown in revenues of Enterprise products.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, quarterly net loss was $2.6 million or a loss of 10 cents per share against a net income of $2.3 million or 8 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. Net sales contraction and higher operating expenses dented the bottom line during the quarter.Non-GAAP net income came in at $0.9 million or 3 cents per share compared with $5 million or 18 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents by a considerable margin.Cambium Networks Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseCambium Networks Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Cambium Networks Corporation QuoteRevenuesDuring the quarter, Cambium generated revenues of $59.5 million, down from $69.3 million in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year decline was attributable to significantly lower sales of Enterprise products owing to aggressive pricing by competitors and soft global economic conditions leading to order cancellations and delays in end-customer projects. Lower net sales in Point-to-Multi-Point (PMP) revenues added to the woes, while higher Point-To-Point (PTP) product sales partially reversed this positive trend. The top line missed the consensus estimate of $76 million.By product category, quarterly revenues at PMP came in at $26.7 million compared with $28.3 million a year ago. The declining demand trends from service providers owing to the transition from PMP 450 products to Cambium’s new gigabit technologies hurt net sales from this segment. Revenues from the PTP business rose to $25.1 million from $15.7 million in the prior-year quarter, driven by robust growth in the defense business. Revenues at the Enterprises business declined to $6.4 million from $24 million in the year-ago quarter.  Region-wise, revenues from North America rose to $39.5 million from $31.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) declined to $6.8 million from $21.3 million in the prior-year quarter. The company witnessed a top-line decline from the CALA (Caribbean and Latin America) region, as revenues fell from $8 million in the year-ago quarter to $6 million. Revenues from Asia-Pacific declined to $7.2 million from $8.9 million in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesOther DetailsNon-GAAP gross profit decreased to $29.9 million from $33.9 million for respective margins of 50.3% and 48.9%. The decline was largely due to lower Enterprise revenues. Non-GAAP operating income was down to $1.6 million from $6.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.8 million compared with $7.8 million a year ago, for respective margins of 4.7% and 11.3%.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityDuring the quarter, Cambium utilized $4.5 million against an operating cash flow of $10 million in the prior-year quarter. As of Jun 30, 2023, the company had a $32 million cash balance with $23.2 million long-term debt.OutlookFor the third quarter of 2023, revenues are expected in the range of $62-$70 million, while non-GAAP earnings are anticipated in the band of $3.7-$6.9 million or 13-25 cents per share. Non-GAAP operating income is projected between $5.2 million and $9.2 million, while adjusted EBITDA is likely to be in the range of $6.3-$10.3 million, with a corresponding margin between 10.2% and 14.8%.For 2023, management has lowered its revenue estimates to the range of $265-$275 million from $327-$337 million. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 50.2% and 51.6%. Non-GAAP net income is expected in the band of $16.7-$21.9 million or 59-78 cents per share, down from $33.7-$36 million or $1.18-$1.26 per share expected earlier. The company plans to maintain its cost-control initiatives, and management is conservative about revenue growth rate owing to the persistence of uncertainty in the global economy.Zacks Rank &amp; Stock to ConsiderArista currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.InterDigital, Inc.

Microsoft has not responded publicly to Mr Wyden’s calls.State Department and company officials jointly revealed the digital break-in last week, with Microsoft saying at the time that it had “contacted all targeted or compromised organisations directly… with important information to help them investigate and respond”.The Chinese forged digital master keys that gave them access to Microsoft’s email servers. Their targets were not named publicly but the company said they mainly included “entities in Western Europe”.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

With me this morning is Niran Baruch, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Finance of AudioCodes. Niran will start off by presenting a financial overview of the quarter. I will then review the business highlights and summary for the quarter and discuss trends and developments in our business and industry. We will then turn it into the Q&amp;A session. Niran?Niran Baruch: Thank you, Shabtai, and hello everyone. Before I start my former remarks, I would like to remind everyone that in conjunction with our earnings release this morning, we will post shortly on our investor relations website and earnings supplemental deck. On today's call, we will be referring to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. The earnings press release that we issued earlier this morning contains a reconciliation of the supplemental non- GAAP financial information that I will be discussing on this call. We will be comparing our second quarter 2023 results to the prior quarter as we believe it provides a better gauge of our financial performance. Revenue for the second quarter were $60 million, an increase of 1.4% over the $59.2 million reported in the first quarter of the current year.Services revenues for the second quarter were $28.5 million, accounted for 47.4% of total revenues. The amount of the deferred revenues as of June 30, 2023 was $77.7 million compared to $77.6 million as of March 31, 2023. Revenue by geographic region for the quarter was split as follows: North America 47%, EMEA 34%, Asia Pacific 13% and Central and Latin America 6%. Our top 15 customers represented an aggregate of 55% of our revenues in the second quarter of which 43% was attributed to our 11 largest distributor. GAAP results are as follows: Gross margin for the quarter was 64.1% compared to 61.7% in Q1 2023. Operating income for the second quarter was $2.3 million or 3.8% of revenues compared to an operating loss of $0.8 million or 1.4% of revenues in Q1 2023.Net income for the quarter was $1.1 million or $0.03 per diluted share compared to an operating loss of $0.2 million or $0.01 per diluted share for Q1, 2023. Non-GAAP results are as follows: Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 64.5% compared to 62.1% in Q1, 2023. Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $5.7 million or 9.5% of revenues compared to $2.9 million or 4.9% of revenues in Q1, 2023. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $5.1 million or $0.16 per diluted share compared to $2.7 million or $0.08 per diluted share in Q1, 2023. At the end of June 2023 cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, marketable securities and financial investment totaled $118.5 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 million for the second quarter of 2023.Day sales outstanding as of June 30, 2023, were 95 days. In June 2023, we received court approval in Israel to purchase up to an aggregate amount of $25 million of additional ordinary shares. The court approval also permits us to declare a dividend of any part of this amount. The approval is valid through December 27, 2023. We declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per share. The aggregate amount of the dividend is approximately $5.7 million. The dividend will be paid on August 31, 2023 to all of our shareholders of record at the close of trading on August 17, 2023. Regarding headcount. As discussed last quarter, we undertook actions to reduce headcount to better align our cost structure to the current business environment. These measures were partially reflected in our second quarter headcount figures, ending the quarter with 946 employees, down from 978 in the first quarter.We expect full amount of headcount reduction and associated cost savings to be reflected in our third quarter. Now to providing an update on our guidance. We reiterate our guidance for revenues for 2023 to be in the range of $240 million to $250 million. We're now raising our guidance for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.70 compared to the original range of $0.50 to $0.70. I will now turn the call back over to Shabtai.SoftwareShabtai Adlersberg: Thank you, Niran. I'm pleased to report second quarter 2023 results with meaningful business activity improvement relative to the prior quarter in our key strategic areas. We executed well in a challenging macro environment, with key growth engines, namely Microsoft, customer experience and voice AI growing nicely. We have also seen bookings experiencing measurable improvements relative to the last quarter. Importantly, core business leading indicators such as pipeline remain robust and we saw relative stabilization in non-core lines such as the service provider and IP phones, which was the line contributing the most the drop in revenue in the first quarter of 2023. These factors, coupled with incremental OpEx savings from cost-cutting actions announced last quarter provide us with increasing confidence to deliver on our commitment of delivering significant improvements in operating leverage over the rest of 2023 and beyond.We made good progress in our enterprise business, now reaching 88% of our company revenue. Microsoft related business in the quarter grew 12% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. Core to this growth was Microsoft Teams business, which grew 18% year-over-year. Strong ongoing momentum for AudioCodes live managed services continued with annual recurring revenue exiting the quarter at $40 million and growing over 60% year-over-year. Live total contract value generated in the second quarter grew 75% over the previous quarter. Strong life performance to date puts us on track to achieve our target of $46 million to $50 million objective for 2023, representing approximately 50% year-over-year growth. Zoom related business grew over 20% year-over-year.We also executed well in our customer experience in a conversational AI business with CX delivering 7% growth year-over-year. Overall, we executed well this quarter in our burgeoning success particularly in live puts us on an accelerated path in our long-term transformation to software and services. Talking about the broad-based improvement in business trends that we saw in second quarter, this clearly a validation of the strong competitive moat that we have built in our voice business. Even in the tight budget environment that we are in, enterprises continue to turn to industry leaders such as AudioCodes for voice connectivity services unified communications and customer experience sectors. What best exemplifies the competitive differentiation we have in our software and services solution is our recent Live Cloud Office Pro [ph] contract win with a Tier 1 service provider.This deal enables migration of the carriers and customers to next-gen UC platforms, starting initially with Microsoft Teams PSTN and voice and then to other leading UC platform over time. As a reminder, Live Cloud Pro is a white label audit codes solution, consisting of managed SBC service along with service delivery in total portal for value -- I'm sorry -- for value-add voice services, such as contact center, recording, interaction analytics of meetings for enterprises, tenants and user management. Important to know that this carrier has conducted a thorough competitive bake-up process of the leading SBC vendors in the market before deciding to synthesize on other code solution. Why did we come out on top? We won based on our best-in-class voice connectivity SaaS solution in our broad portfolio of service of devices, software application and services that is unparalleled in the industry.Partners and end customers alike have a strong preference for reducing complexity in our unique end-to-end unified communications and customer experience platform approach provides us with a significant leg up on our competition. While the initial value of this contract award size is small, the long-term revenue opportunity is large. As one, this carrier operates in a market that is the very early stage of cloud transformation. And second, significant upsell potential for our broader portfolio for solutions. We are grateful for this trust that this Tier 1 carrier is placing us as well as others that have made a live and live cloud managed services offering a rousing success. We look forward to providing ongoing update on the progress in our long-term transformation to software and services revenue stream.Before turning to detailed business segment discussions, let's quickly shift to profitability metrics and guidance. Our second quarter 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.16 in the quarter, exceeding our internal budget. We estimate roughly half of the earnings upside to the higher non-GAAP gross margins and the balance to the lower OpEx in the quarter. Second quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 64.5%, which improved from 62.1% in the previous quarter, driven primarily by more favorable product mix. Second quarter OpEx was $33 million, down from $33.9 million in the prior quarter, with the decline attributable to earlier than expected implementation of the cost-cutting measures announced last quarter. Regarding headcount. Accordingly, we ended the quarter with headcount of 946 full-time employees, down from 978 employees in the first quarter.We expect our OpEx to continue to step down to $32 million in third quarter 2023, down approximately $2 million from the first quarter 2023 levels. On the guidance front, as Niran already stated, we are reiterating our 2023 revenue guidance. While we adjust our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to $0.55 to $0.70 to reflect better-than-expected second quarter earnings results. This outlook builds in continued conservative enterprise spending environment in our previously announced cost optimization. Now to specific business line operations. First is the Microsoft business. Microsoft business increased 12% year-over-year in the second quarter, which compares with down 3% in the first quarter. That's a very nice improvement. In terms of second quarter Microsoft business, Teams increased 18% year-over-year and 20% sequentially, while Skype for Business was down over 50% year-over-year and 33% sequentially.We are now towards the end of the transition of Microsoft business from Skype for Business Teams. And as such, the negative impact from Skype for Business declined over the past three and a half years becomes negligible going forward. Microsoft business has shown strength mainly in North America and Asia-Pacific, while roughly flat in EMEA. In terms of bookings of new Microsoft business, we continue to see stronger performance in 2023 compared to 2022. Hence, the greater number of sizable live deals that we closed in second quarter in North America and Asia-Pacific, while EMEA region remains subdued. Overall, we added 282 million new Teams accounts in the quarter, up from 250 accounts in the first quarter. On its earnings call last week, Microsoft disclosed over 17 million PSTN users, representing 45% growth year-over-year.The healthy stream of Teams PSTN voice ads in a tightly enterprise budget environment, further underscores the value proposition of adding Teams phone to the overall Teams experience. Importantly, the 17 million-plus PSTN users represent just a fraction of the overall 300 million Teams users -- monthly active users, providing us with ample multiyear runway to drive ongoing penetration gain. One care for us in the Microsoft business is the Teams live deals, which represents each a high total contract value. I'm glad to inform that in the second quarter, we were able to sign close to 10 accounts with a total contract value of above $0.5 million, roughly $0.5 million to $1 million, which helps to build for us a very stable growing backlog of monthly recurring revenues for the next 36 months and beyond.Now to our contact center business. Contact center business grew 7% year-over-year in the quarter, and strength in North America and Asia-Pacific. After several quarters of lumpiness in this area, we believe we may be approaching an inflection point in CX bookings growth and more so in live CX deals. Live CX deals show great potential for the future as they relate to the migration of mega contact center accounts from legacy on-prem vendors onto new cloud based contact center implementation and the need to substantially transform and switch the voice access network between different CX vendors is a result of an on-prem to cloud migration disruption. Underlying this growing confidence is a maturation of the deals within healthy pipeline built over the past 12 months, consisting of core SBC Voca CIC entry-level Microsoft Teams, contact center solution and other voice AI application opportunities.I would like to give you an example of a recent live CX contract we signed with a Tier 1 global system integrator in support of a multinational logistics firm. We believe that this deal brings to bear the broad capabilities of our live CX and conversational AI portfolio. Just a brief background, this large global customer intends to migrate over a multiyear period, tens of thousands of contact center agents spread of 200 locations in over 100 countries from a large incumbent on-prem contact center vendor to a CCaaS vendor. AudioCodes was selected as the SBC vendor of choice for the following reasons. One, our SBC managed service saved the customer valuable time and costly internal IT resources that are required for such a large complex migration project.Second, our custom design business continuity solution, leveraging our Voca conversational AI/VR smart compliance recording and WebRTC client. In the event of a service outage in the cloud solution, and in the CCaaS platform, incoming costs would be seamlessly diverted to our solution to our system, thereby ensuring service continuity. Third, having this extra layer of insurance is of paramount importance to this customer and is a key factor in its decision to move to a CCaaS platform. Note that our custom-built architecture has been approved by the corporate division of the customer and could be purchased at individual contact center site levels. This contract carries a multiyear deployment schedule and upon full ramp, annual recurring revenue is expected to reach $1 million without accounting for incremental revenues associated with expected uptake of our business continuity service.Now to services. Services accounted for 47.5% of revenue and grew 2.7% year-over-year compared to 10.8% in the previous quarter, with the deceleration in growth rate primarily related to timing of professional services completion. Notably, our professional services bookings remained strong, up 18% in the quarter, implying healthy growth over the balance of the year. While this fueled our ongoing momentum in services, primarily in our live subscriptions business, which ended second quarter at $40 million ARR, up from over $36 million last quarter. Additionally, we ended the quarter with total contract value for our live subscription signed from inception of this program, exceeding $120 million, up from over $110 million last quarter, providing us with increasing level of revenue visibility.At this stage, the backlog of managed services projects recurring revenue grows steadily and has shown growth of well over 50% in the second quarter. We expect strong momentum in live services to continue in 2023 and beyond and reiterate our annual recurring revenue target of $46 million to $50 million by the end of 2023. Now to Voice AI. Voice AI business grew over 15% year-over-year. As presented already in the past, we have identified the potential of applying AI technologies to the world of voice back in 2018 when we established the Voice AI Group. Now employing close to 100 R&amp;D employees and which have since engaged in the development of technology and solutions for several advanced AI applications. What's unique in these major investments of ours is the fact that this is in a sense, a departure from our traditional world of voice networking and connectivity to a new world of voice application, which are based on software and application.It's going to be software and services centric. We have since developed several applications, one of which we announced yesterday. Voca Conversational Interaction Center, which is an AI first CCaaS solution in which we target to grow into meaningful new business line for us, which will generate tens of millions of dollars in the next couple of years. In fact, adding Voca CIC to our already existing business of SBC and live CX services and adding in the future a new evolving application of interactive analytics, we believe we are creating a very strong second leg of the CX business side-by-side with our successful business of voice solutions for the unified communication as a service line. Voca Conversational Interactive Center, our entry-level Microsoft Teams native AI-first contact center is garnering significant customer interest in 2023, as enterprises are increasingly looking to leverage Teams for true consolidation of UCaaS and CCaaS.As announced yesterday, Voca CIC is now officially certified by Microsoft Teams contact center solution. We also made significant progress in our conversational AI lines. We made good progress on other lines, we'll touch them immediately. So, let's talk about the different lines. Let's talk about Voice AI Connect. This is a connectivity service supporting voice bots, use cases such as virtual agents and agent assist. Voice AI Connect made good progress in the quarter. Second quarter bookings nearly doubled from first quarter, helped by expansion purchases by multiple customers, which speaks for the efficacy of our solutions and the growing adoption of conversation AI particularly amongst large enterprises. Voca CIC, we have contracts awards nearly doubled sequentially in the quarter and created opportunities pipeline remained robust, growing over three times on a year-by-year basis.What has been fueling our burgeoning success here is a strong position in Teams' voice ecosystem, giving us an attractive installed base from which we can upsell our entry-level CCaaS solution and enterprise customers increasingly look to leverage Teams for both consolidated UC and CX environment. Now let's mention Meeting Insights. This is our meeting room solution. Basically, we have completed the integration of GPT-4, making officially available to end customers productivity enhancement services such as auto generating meeting summary outline and action items, leveraging the power of generative AI. We are not stopping there as we are making investment to build new products to drive more actionable insights for our users and towards the development for own LLM technology.To wrap up, we have executed well in a challenging macro environment, with key growth engine in our core business, namely Microsoft customer experience and Voice AI bookings experiencing measurable improvements relative to the last quarter. Importantly, core business leading indicators, such as pipeline remain robust, while non-core service provider and access fund business lines seem to have stabilized. These factors, coupled with incremental OpEx savings from cost-cutting actions announced last quarter provide us with increasing confidence in our ability to deliver on our commitment of delivering significant improvements in operating leverage over the rest of 2023 and beyond.

106,55c77fd6-8ab5-30f6-b694-4bd82c797fb2,MSFT,2023-08-03,Earnings Estimates Reflect Stabilization,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-estimates-reflect-stabilization-232400914.html,1691018640,STORY,['MSFT'],"[Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points: The picture emerging from the Q2 earnings season is one of continued resilience and strength, with an above-average proportion of companies not only beating estimates but also providing reassuring guidance for the coming periods. There continues to be modest pressure on estimates for Q3 and beyond, but a big part of that is coming from the Energy sector. Outside of the Energy sector, estimates are very stable and are actually going up for some sectors. Importantly, the evolving earnings outlook for the coming periods is inconsistent with the long-feared ‘earnings cliff’ narrative. For the 335 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results, total earnings are down -9.8% from the same period last year on +0.3% higher revenues, with 80.6% beating EPS estimates and 66.3% beating revenue estimates.For 2023 Q2, S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to decline -8.6% from the same period last year on +0.3% higher revenues. This would follow the -3.4% decline in index earnings in the preceding period (2023 Q1) and the -5.4% decline in the last quarter of 2022.In other words, 2023 Q2 is expected to be the third consecutive quarter of declining S&amp;P 500 earnings. The expectation currently is for another earnings decline in Q3 of -2.1%, after which growth turns positive in Q4 and continues in 2024. In fact, Q3 earnings would be positive had it not been for the Energy sector drag.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see from these quarterly earnings-growth expectations, the long-feared recession doesn’t show up in this near-term earnings outlook. A big-picture view of corporate profitability on a long-term basis doesn’t leave much room for a recession either, as you can see in the chart below.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThese growth expectations reflect current bottom-up consensus earnings estimates for the individual S&amp;P 500 companies that, in turn, are based on the estimates from individual sell-side analysts that cover those companies.Predicting recessions is beyond the core competence of equity research analysts. But they do keep a close eye on the evolving business trends for the companies and industries they follow. Analysts maintain elaborate financial models for the companies in their coverage, which allows them to come up with their earnings, revenues, and other estimates.We at Zacks make it our business to closely monitor how analysts’ earnings estimates evolve over time. In fact, our rating system, the Zacks Rank, is based on earnings estimate revisions.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have flagged a notable stabilization in the estimate revisions trend since the start of 2023 Q2, reversing the persistently negative trend that had been in place for almost a year prior.Earnings estimates in the aggregate for the S&amp;P 500 index have come down only a touch since the start of April, with a number of key sectors starting to see modest positive estimate revisions. These sectors include Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Tech, Medical, and Retail.Hard to tell at this stage if the revisions trend will remain on its recent positive trajectory or revert back to its original negative trend. But it is nevertheless a market-friendly development.Sector FocusThe strong Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL reports reassured investors of opportunities in artificial intelligence while showing clear signs of stabilization, if not altogether improvement, in their core businesses.Alphabet’s better-than-expected Q2 earnings and revenues represented year-over-year growth rates of +14.8% and +8%, respectively. The company’s results show reacceleration in search and clear signs of stabilization in advertising spending, with the latter getting reconfirmed by strong results from Meta META, whose +26.2% earnings growth in Q2 came paired with +11% top-line growth and some margin gains.Microsoft’s top- and bottom-line beats represented year-over-year earnings and revenue growth rates of +20% and +8.3%, respectively. Guidance suggested strong demand for its AI services, as the raised Azure revenue guidance shows. Microsoft also indicated accelerating its cloud investments, with capex sequentially increasing each of the next four quarters. This likely provides a favorable read-through for Nvidia NVDA and other chipmakers.Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Nvidia are part of what we call the ‘Big 7 Tech Players’, with Apple, Tesla, and Amazon as the remaining club members. These mega-cap players have led the market’s surge this year, though the rally has recently expanded beyond these seven stocks.For the ‘Big 7 Tech Players’ as a whole, Q2 earnings are expected to be up +20.4% from the same period last year on +9% higher revenues, as the chart below shows.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe chart below shows the group’s earnings picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ2 earnings for the Tech sector as a whole are expected to be up +0.5% from the same period last year on +0.9% higher revenues. Estimates have inched up since the period got underway, largely reflecting more effective cost controls. But the aforementioned signs of stabilization in Microsoft and Alphabet’s core businesses will go some ways towards improving the revenue outlook for the group.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A Comprehensive Analysis,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walgreens-boots-alliance-inc-wba-193235951.html,1691004755.0,STORY,"['WBA', 'VALU']","[Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) recently experienced a 3.21% gain, with a share price of $30.52. Despite this, the company reported a Loss Per Share of $3.84. The question that arises: Is Walgreens Boots Alliance a potential value trap? This article explores this question, delving into the company's financials, valuation, and future prospects. Read on for an insightful analysis.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with WBA. Click here to check it out. WBA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of WBAWalgreens Boots Alliance is one of the largest retail pharmacy chains in the U.S., boasting over 8,500 locations. Almost three quarters of Americans live within five miles of a Walgreens store. The company generates approximately two thirds of its revenue from prescription drug sales, contributing to 20% of total prescription revenue in the U.S. Additionally, Walgreens also earns from retail products, European drug wholesale, and healthcare. With more locations incorporating services like Health Corner and Village Medical, Walgreens creates an omnichannel experience for patients, positioning itself as a comprehensive healthcare provider.Is Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA) a Value Trap? A Comprehensive AnalysisUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated considering historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line represents the stock's ideal fair trading value. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.At its current price of $30.52 per share and a market cap of $26.3 billion, Walgreens Boots Alliance is significantly undervalued based on its price-to-GF-Value ratio. However, the stock's warning signs, which include a low Altman Z-score of 1.79, suggests that the stock may be a potential value trap.Story continuesIs Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA) a Value Trap? A Comprehensive AnalysisFinancial StrengthExamining the financial strength of a company is crucial before investing. Companies with poor financial strength pose a higher risk of permanent loss. The cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage offer insight into a company's financial strength. Walgreens Boots Alliance has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.03, worse than 93.37% of companies in the Healthcare Providers &amp; Services industry, indicating poor financial strength.Is Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA) a Value Trap? A Comprehensive AnalysisProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk. Walgreens Boots Alliance has been profitable for 10 out of the past 10 years. However, with an operating margin of -5.53%, it performs worse than 68.1% of companies in the Healthcare Providers &amp; Services industry. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Walgreens Boots Alliance is 5.6%, ranking worse than 58.77% of companies in the industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is another way to gauge its profitability. For the past 12 months, Walgreens Boots Alliance's ROIC is -6.08, and its WACC is 4.6, suggesting the company is not generating sufficient returns on its capital investments.Is Walgreens Boots Alliance a Value Trap?Despite showing signs of undervaluation, Walgreens Boots Alliance may be a potential value trap due to its poor financial strength, fair profitability, and below-average growth. The company's Altman Z-score, a measure of its financial health and bankruptcy risk, stands at 1.79, placing it in the distress zone. Ideally, an Altman Z-score above 2.99 signifies a safer financial position.ConclusionIn conclusion, Walgreens Boots Alliance shows signs of being a potential value trap. The company's financial condition is poor due to its low Z-score. Its growth ranks below 66.92% of companies in the Healthcare Providers &amp; Services industry.

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger exclusively told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""And I just say, I don't see anything on the horizon for that.""""So at one level, I just sort of say, OK, it's a downgrade,"" added the globe-trotting Gelsinger. ""Hey, there may be some implications for costs of debt. But I really see that as somewhat minor.

Fitch said it ""expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years"" as one reason for its downgrade. The other factors included a ""growing debt burden"" and the ""erosion of governance.""Stocks promptly sold off on Wednesday, led lower by a 2% drop in the Nasdaq Composite. The S&amp;P 500 suffered its first 1% down day since May, Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre pointed out.Markets remain under pressure globally on Thursday as the downgrade continues to weigh on investor sentiment.Interestingly, and to Gelsinger's point, the US dollar has gained strength in the wake of Fitch's move, now hovering around a four-week high.Other top executives Yahoo Finance have talked to are using the downgrade moment to play up their financial strength to investors.""It's incredibly important,"" Starbucks (SBUX) CFO Rachel Ruggeri told Yahoo Finance about the downgrade. ""That's why we've been focused on continuing to operate within a three-times-leverage ratio. So that's the guide that we keep so that we can maintain our BBB+ rating. But also, it allows us to be able to support, I'd say, a more conservative stance in terms of our overall financial health.""Story continuesFor Intel's Gelsinger, it's business as usual for his tech giant.""I'd say in terms of the impact of me running Intel as a business or CEOs like myself running global businesses, I don't see that much real impact from this change,"" Gelsinger said.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Overall, Narasimhan says customizations, such as cold foam, ""contribute to over $1 billion in revenue annually.""So who is buying all of those drinks?Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri tells Yahoo Finance Live ""it's definitely skewed more towards a younger consumer.

And this wasn't even in the height of summer when it's super hot. Is this a secular change in how people consume coffee? Is this like the knew-- is this just what it is now, that people are going to drink cold coffee year round and that's it?RACHEL RUGGERI: It's definitely skewed more towards a younger consumer. And so we have a large consumer base of millennials and Gen Z, and their tastes and preferences tend to be more cold. Now, I'm way over Gen Z and I love cold espresso, so. But it is definitely an increasing trend, and we don't see it going away.Story continuesWhat we're encouraged about in the quarter is that our beverage grew 10%, and that was a combination of growth in both hot and cold. So we did see growth of about 2% weighted on that 10 from the hot perspective, but we also saw cold grill about 8%.So we continue to innovate in both areas so that we can, you know, offer coffee and continue to lead in coffee for all of the different customer tastes and profiles, but definitely cold is a big opportunity for us, which is why you see us continuing to innovate in areas like ice shake and espresso and refreshment, and even with our new blended lemonade refreshers.Those are all areas for us to be able to continue that growth in cold, which not only grows in the morning but actually has a position across all dayparts so we see a lot of opportunity ahead, but it's definitely not going away.- And one investment that got a lot of buzz this past quarter among consumers is those new ice nuggets that you guys are switching over to. How much money do you expect to save at the end of the day with this investment, and what's the response so far?RACHEL RUGGERI: Well, what I'd say is we're in the early journey of what we call our nugget ice. And being able to put nugget ice in our stores, we've hit our highest volume of cold stores so that we can actually support the capacity. And that's largely what the nugget ice is about-- it's to be able to support the capacity of the cold demand.And so we'll continue to roll out across our stores. Early on what we're seeing is, it's better for partners, it's easier in terms of overall it blends faster. Eventually, it'll be piped into the stores so they'll no longer have to be, you know, carrying buckets of ice. And so it's a better option for the partners and creates a better experience, but at the same time, our customers love it.And so the combination of that, you know, gives us confidence that we'll be able to continue to fuel the growth-- cold growth that we see, you know, with improvements and advancements like nugget ice.]"

And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Laxman.Laxman Narasimhan: Thank you, Tiffany, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. In a few moments, Rachel Ruggeri will walk you through the detailed results of the third quarter, and Belinda Wong would then join us for Q&amp;A. To start, our strong third quarter results point to all-around momentum in the business. This quarter, we grew consolidated revenue by 12%, up 14% when excluding more than a 1% impact in foreign currency translation to a record $9.2 billion. Importantly, earnings growth of 19% outpaced revenue growth with margin expanding by 50 basis points to 17.4%. Our strong performance reflects the strengthened foundation of our business, resulting from the significant progress we are making against our reinvention plan.Since stepping into the role, I have now traveled to every region, working directly with partners. I left each interaction impressed by the differentiated global appeal of the Starbucks brand powered by innovation and anchored in our unique ability to deliver human connection. These experiences give me great confidence in the significant growth and margin opportunities in front of us, positioning us well to strengthen the brand and create outsized long-term shareholder value. It was this time last year when Howard and the team identified the must-win opportunities and investments for our foundational reinvention plan. While Rachel will walk you through detailed results, I will now outline the momentum we have from the quarter in five key priority areas while pointing out where we see further headroom.Our first priority, we will elevate the brand by running great stores. This comes to life in the strengthened execution in North America. Our North America team delivered record revenue in the quarter, with a growth of 11% underpinned by 7% comparable same-store sales growth, leading to the highest average weekly sales in our history. Our ticket growth was driven by pricing, customization and food attach. Additionally, we continue to see improvements in items sold per labor hour. Operationally, we are seeing evidence that we are executing better. Barista attrition, where we are already industry-leading has improved further by 11% year-over-year. Through scheduling and staffing improvements, we are beginning to increase the number of hours per partner in store, critical to running great stores and improving partner engagement while also improving productivity.Innovation in beverage and equipment continues to drive our business. In fact, our cold business reached 75% of U.S. beverage sales this past quarter. As the leader in premium coffee, we are particularly encouraged to see cold espresso beverages were up 13% year-over-year. Additionally, we continue to elevate the premium coffee experience in both cold and hot. For example, the rollout of our Clover Vertica brewer continues as planned, delivering a larger variety of high-quality hot coffee, including decaffeinated on demand. Our innovative equipment rollout remains on track, are faster and easier to use portable handheld cold form blenders continue to have an outsized impact for both the partner and customer experience. The cold foam blenders are now rolled out to all U.S. company-operated stores in time to meet the summer demand for Starbucks Refreshers' frozen beverages.The new blenders support the additional growth of cold foam, the fastest-growing customization at Starbucks. Modifiers such as cold foam now contribute to over $1 billion in revenue annually. The Mastrena 2 espresso machines and new warming ovens are also now in all U.S. company-operated stores. Taken all together, our equipment investments that we began last year are supporting labor efficiencies, allowing us to increase capacity during our busiest day parts. These investments are both elevating the Starbucks Experience and further differentiating us from competitors. In this past quarter in North America, we once again saw our unit volume outpace pre-COVID levels by double-digits with high attach rates across dayparts, the mornings as well as the afternoons.Also in thinking about dayparts, our Starbucks Refreshers platform, which skews towards an alternate location occasion has seen double-digit growth this past quarter in every daypart. With this success, we are leaning in even further with a systematic pipeline of innovation across dayparts. This includes this summer's launch of our Starbucks Refreshers frozen beverages, customization in our Oleato beverage platform as well as with our cold-pressed Cold Brew, which enters a testing phase across a few dozen stores this fourth quarter with a rollout across U.S. company-owned stores expected by the end of fiscal year 2024. Food is also fueling growth. This past quarter, we saw all-time high food attach and sales of breakfast sandwiches. As an attached business, food drove a higher ticket in the quarter, improving volume growth and contributing to the record average weekly sales.Overall, we are excited about the significant opportunity in food as we explore new, elevated and convenient food offerings. We will share more of this in time. We also continue to grow and diversify our store portfolio. We see significant headroom for new store growth in underpenetrated areas in the U.S., including smaller cities as well as new formats in larger metros. New stores and remodels are where we are first prioritizing our Siren System equipment rollout and we plan to move all stores to brand-forward digital menu boards over the next couple of years to further sharpen personalization and daypart activation. We are seeing strong growth in delivery. In fact, we are close to creating a $1 billion incremental leg in our delivery business from minimal presence a few years ago.And now we are operationally setting ourselves up for this channel in major markets, starting from a position of strength. As a second strategic priority, we're looking ahead at how we will further strengthen and differentiate our leadership position in digital. In the third quarter, we continued to grow our digital universe. Our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards customers grew to nearly 75 million globally, growing more than 25% in the quarter. This was driven by a record 90-day active user base of 31.4 million Starbucks Rewards customers in the U.S., an approximate 15% growth or 4 million new customers from the previous year. Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S. drove 57% of tender for the second consecutive quarter, up over 3 percentage points from the prior year.In China, we hit the highest number of 90-day active users we have ever had at over 20 million Starbucks Rewards customers. This is further evidence of our brand strength, relevance and customer engagement in the market. Starbucks has had a long track record of industry-leading digital innovation. As we approach the fundamental platform transformation underway with AI, we intend to invest to lead in this area using a foundational Deep Brew capability as the launching pad. Our focus in these investments will remain on improving the partner experience while elevating the customer experience and delivering productivity gains. We are revamping our approach to further accelerate digital innovation, including order, including payment and delivery enhancements, in terms of speed and personalization, which we believe leads to greater habituation by our customers.This includes developments in the U.S. mobile app user experience as well. Additionally, we plan to make significant investments in China to further enhance our digital capabilities in the market. Our third priority is global growth. As a company with over 100 million customer occasions each week, more than 37,000 stores and operating in 86 markets around the world, the runway for global growth is limitless. For the quarter, we again saw double-digit top line growth across the International segment. The segment delivered record system sales for the second consecutive quarter as well as the highest revenue and operating margin since the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, we continue to see double-digit growth in the company-owned markets of Japan and the U.K., while the geographic license partners across the rest of the world all reported very strong performance.Our international store growth was 10% year-over-year. New stores are bringing attractive unit economics for the business while we benefit from strong growth in returns on invested capital in these markets. Turning to China. I am encouraged by our performance in the quarter. I had the opportunity to spend time in the market recently. I can now fully appreciate the extraordinary strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand, which is known as Xingbake locally. Looking at our third quarter results, our China revenue grew 51% from the prior year or up 60% when excluding a 9% impact of foreign currency translation. Additionally, we sequentially grew our revenue 8% from the prior quarter or up 10% when excluding a 2% impact of foreign currency translation, underscoring the robust long-term health of our business.Despite these early days in our recovery journey, stores that opened in fiscal year 2019 or earlier achieved full sales recovery in the routine morning daypart while other dayparts reported sequential monthly improvement. A strong recovery in the third quarter was amplified by the many distinctive competitive advantage that set us apart in China. The first and foremost advantages are in comparable partners who honor the heritage of our company, bring sophisticated appreciation for our high quality coffee and passion for delivering the Starbucks Experience in ways that are relevant to our Chinese customers. Our second advantage is our vertically integrated operations. We start with a locally relevant and increasingly greener store footprint.Our distinctively designed stores across formats celebrate the Chinese culture in a unique Xingbake manner, reflecting local arts, crafts and calligraphy. In the fall, we plan to open our Coffee Innovation Park, our single largest and most sustainable manufacturing investment outside of the U.S. This next-generation facility with state-of-the-art supply chain operations will also include a unique customer immersion center. Third, our locally relevant innovation in China for over 20 years has won over customers in what has historically been a tea-drinking culture. Today, we have nearly 6,500 stores and another nearly 2,400 points of customer connection through our We Proudly Serve program in China. And yet, there is so much more opportunity ahead in underpenetrated areas within this market.Some growth facts to think about. The average person in China drinks 12 cups of coffee each year. That significantly lower coffee consumption than in Tier 1 cities like Shanghai, where we first entered the market and now have nearly 1,100 stores. And we still have more room to grow in Shanghai. Compare this also to Japan where our per capita is 200 cups versus the 12 cups in China and the U.S., where the per capita is closer to 380. We are still in our early days in China, one of the largest consumer markets. With our locally-based investments in R&amp;D and locally relevant offerings like our Dragon dumplings, which had an amazing quarter. We have built a brand that is highly relevant for China, in China. And we believe our unique approach has us well positioned to play the long game and win.coffeePixabay/Public DomainFinally, another advantage in China is digital. This will be further demonstrated with highly digital supply chains we run and in the way we engage our customers. We are reshaping our business models, leaning into the remarkable loyalty of our Starbucks Rewards members as well as convenience offerings, including delivery and curbside for our On-The-Go business. A comment on our international business beyond the U.S. and China. We have seen very strong growth and strong unit economics in these markets. It is becoming an important third leg for us. Looking outside the stores in the third quarter, our Channel Development segment revenue was $449 million, down 6% year-over-year, while delivering operating margin of 46.3%, up 630 basis points year-over-year, reflecting SKU rationalization as well as the shifts taking place with a more on-the-go customer.We continue to see the opportunity for growth in channel-through innovation, as evidenced by the highly successful ready-to-drink Starbucks Pink Drink and Starbucks Paradise Drink introduced last quarter and the Grab and Go series launched in Japan in partnership with Suntory. We saw unprecedented sales during the first month of the launch in Japan, just as we did with our cream cheese lattes in China. Our fourth strategic priority is fueling productivity. We think of our business as a theater in the front and a factory in the back. We have a clear opportunity to maximize efficiencies and effectiveness while reducing waste by focusing on a vast opportunity in stores and also above stores. We have focused on meaningful improvements in staffing and scheduling to ensure that we have the right combination of the right partners in the right roles with the right hours to fuel both engagement and productivity.We also closed the third quarter on target with our waste reduction goals as we strive to make operations as efficient as possible while preserving the Starbucks Experience. This is just the beginning of the productivity journey at Starbucks. We have broadened the areas beyond our initial reinvention plan to include our end-to-end supply chain, direct and indirect procurement, how we design and build stores as well as opportunities across technology and our supporting processes. Arthur Valdez, Jr., who joined us recently as the Chief Supply Chain Officer, brings three decades of supply chain and logistics leadership to Starbucks and will be critical in these efforts. Along with sales leverage, what I could see in opportunities with future productivity gains gives me real confidence in long-term progressive margin expansion.Finally, the DNA of Starbucks is nothing without our culture. This is inherent to the company and something I was quick to learn through my immersion and experience working in stores. Our fifth strategic priority is reinvigorating our culture of human connection. We will measure our success on our business performance through the lens of humanity, just as we always have. And that requires us to reinvigorate our culture. Our partners are the heart of our business for me. We will continue to invest in the overall partner experience through compensation and benefits as well as through in-store improvements. At Starbucks, we strive to be a different kind of company, but we do recognize that we are operating in a different kind of world. It is through that lens we have spent the last several months rolling out a new unifying mission for the company, new promises for all our stakeholders and soon, a new set of values that will reground the culture of Starbucks in our heritage and a more modernized workplace.Before I turn the call over to Rachel, I want to leave you with this. It is an honor to be driving such a stellar branded company in one of its best chapters. While we continue to navigate in an environment with a heightened level of macro uncertainty around the world, we will execute with discipline and rigor on our priorities. After all, Starbucks is a strong, resilient brand delivering to customers what the world needs most right now, human connection. As I look at the runway in front of us, the possibilities to deliver that connection are truly limitless. What I see is a durable iconic business with multiple paths available for us to deliver on our long-term revenue growth of 10% to 12% and earnings growth of 15% to 20%. I look forward to discussing our strategies and plans for fiscal year 2024 and beyond in greater detail in November in an extended investor call organized in a hybrid media format.We would share more details in the coming weeks. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rachel to talk more about our remarkable third quarter financial performance of the quarter. Rachel?Rachel Ruggeri: Thank you, Laxman, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to discuss our Q3 performance, which beat our expectations as our innovation and our brand continues to resonate with our customers around the world, fueling demand across our stores and digitally. Our U.S. business delivered record breaking performance on many fronts, and our China business continued to recover in line with our expectations. It's clear we have abundant opportunity ahead. Our overall performance was bolstered by the progress we're making against our strategies, specifically our reinvention plan and it's unfolding into tangible financial results. As a reminder, when we set guidance at the beginning of the year, we said that the benefits from our reinvention plan would amplify at the back half of this fiscal year, and that is exactly what we're seeing, highlighting our ability to effectively reinvest in our business for the benefit of all stakeholders.Our Q3 consolidated revenue reached a record $9.2 billion, up 12% from the prior year or up 14% when excluding more than 1% impact of foreign currency translation. The strength of the brand, loyalty of our customers and innovative products fueled strong sales resulting in double-digit consolidated comparable store sales growth of 10%. In addition to the 10% comparable store sales growth, revenue also benefited from 7% net new company-operated store growth globally year-over-year as well as continued momentum in our global licensed market. Q3 consolidated operating margin expanded 50 basis points from the prior year to 17.4%, exceeding our expectations, primarily driven by sales leverage, pricing and productivity improvement from increased efficiency in our U.S. stores.Margin expansion was partially offset by investments in store partners as well as higher G&amp;A costs in support of reinvention. Q3 EPS was $1, up 19% from the prior year, driven by strong performance across our business segments, demonstrating the power of a broad global portfolio. I'll now provide segment highlights for Q3. North America delivered another record quarter of revenue with $6.7 billion in Q3, up 11% from the prior year, primarily driven by a 7% increase in comparable store sales, consisting of 6% and 1% growth in average ticket and transactions, respectively, as well as net new company-operated store growth of 4% year-over-year. Our results were further strengthened by the continued momentum from our licensed store business. Our U.S. business delivered 7% comparable store sales growth in Q3, primarily driven by solid ticket performance with 6% growth, which benefited from a combination of pricing, food attach and customization.Our customers have relatively adopted the practice of customizing their beverages, allowing for a more personalized and differentiated experience while contributing to a growing higher-margin ticket with abundant opportunity ahead. In Q3, over 60% of beverages were customized, representing a 9% growth when compared to just five years ago. Cold Foam, for example, continues to be a customization favorite. This quarter's all-time high food attach was driven by two of every five customers attaching food with their orders, up over 25% from just five years ago, driven by our delicious breakfast sandwiches leading to an all-time high ticket in the quarter. Transaction comparable sales growth in the quarter was 1%, which combined with record ticket drove the highest average weekly sales in our company's history, surpassing the all-time high set during holiday in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.We are seeing more customers come into our stores with customer counts up 5% year-over-year, in line with the record high set in Q1 of this fiscal year. Our growing tech enabled convenience capabilities are driving our customers to engage more deeply with Starbucks as evidenced by the growth in customization, attach and mix shift towards more premium beverages, leading to record demand and incremental higher-margin revenue. Another proof point of our continued demand is the ongoing success of our Starbucks Rewards program, which ended the quarter achieving records on many fronts, a record number of active members, spend per member and total member spend. These records alone reflect the stickiness of our business, but we are most pleased by the consistency of our customer connection stores, which highlights customer satisfaction and the delivery of the Starbucks Experience.U.S. licensed stores revenue continued its momentum this quarter, up 21% from the prior year with strength across the portfolio and vending food (ph) from increases in post-COVID travel, especially return of business travel, which benefits from Starbucks Connect, our digital offering, now rolled out across all major U.S. airports. North America's operating margin was 21.8% in Q3, contracting 40 basis points from the prior year as expected, primarily driven by the timing of productivity focused labor investments as part of our reinvention plan. For color, the reinvention investments included partner wages and benefits as well as an increase in targeted partner training. The contraction was partially offset by favorable impacts of pricing coupled with labor productivity and sales leverage largely from the ramping benefits of the reinvention plan.Moving on to International. In the quarter, the segment delivered $2 billion in revenue, the highest revenue since Q4 of fiscal year 2021, up 24% from the prior year or up 30% when excluding more than 5% impact from foreign currency translation. Our revenue growth reflects double-digit growth in all major markets, including China, which benefited from lapping prior year mobility restrictions. The growth is attributable to a 24% increase in comparable store sales, which was driven by 21% transaction growth as customers continued returning to our stores, largely in China as well, as remarkable digital engagement through the increasing Starbucks Rewards member base. In addition, the International segment delivered 11% net new company-operated store growth year-over-year, with China contributing a significant portion of store growth as we continue to invest ahead of the curve in China, supporting our long-term ambitions for the market.Excluding China, our international markets combined continued their strong momentum with revenue growing 11% year-over-year in Q3 or up 14% when excluding a 3 percentage impact from foreign currency translation. The meaningful growth was a byproduct of our successful innovation and digital engagement across various markets. Excluding China, International had 8% store growth year-over-year and approximately 35% of our new stores year-to-date were drive-through, resulting in approximately 15% of total store count having the drive-through channel furthering our ability to create new occasions and serve new customers globally. Shifting to China. China had a strong quarter, delivering their highest beverage sales for Q3 over the last five years, underpinned by comparable store sales growth of 46% in Q3, in line with our expectations.Comp growth was driven by strong transactions, which benefited from the lapping prior year Q3 mobility restrictions. As the market continues to recover, we're pleased with the consistency of demand fueled by new product innovation, increasing digital capability, record sales of our Dragon Dumpling Festival food and an acceleration of new store openings amounting to nearly three stores per day. Average weekly sales in China grew quarter-over-quarter and we expect this to continue into Q4 with average weekly sales growth of low to mid-single digits, resulting in similar sized comp growth for the quarter. With the current demand and the long-term opportunity we see in China, we continue to invest in our stores, partners and communities. And we'll have our largest roasting plant outside of the U.S., the Coffee Innovation Park opening this fall.Our unwavering investments have contributed to our healthy recovery and performance, positioning us well for the long term. Operating margin for the International segment was 19% in Q3, expanding an impressive 660 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by sales leverage from lapping prior year mobility restrictions in China, partially offset by investments in digital and partner wages as well as inflationary pressures. Shifting to Channel Development. The segment's revenue contracted 6% year-over-year to $449 million in Q3, driven largely by at-home coffee while proudly holding the number one share position at 15.1%. Despite the softening of revenue, the segment remained strong due to the breadth and depth of the portfolio. We are particularly proud of our North American coffee partnership, which continued to see category-leading sales and share growth outpacing the total category.Our innovation continues to distinguish us while benefiting the segment overall with strong performance. A perfect example of this is the award-winning ready-to-drink Starbucks Pink Drink and Starbucks Paradise Drink that Laxman mentioned earlier. The segment's operating margin was 46.3% in Q3, up a resounding 630 basis points from prior year, driven by strength in the North America coffee partnership and sales mix shift. As previously shared, operating margin has returned to the segment's normal mid-40s range, a testament of our strong partnerships and the benefits of a diversified portfolio. Now moving to guidance for the balance of fiscal year 2023. Given we're in the final quarter of our fiscal year with clear visibility into full year results, combined with the momentum we've built, the pace of reinvention plan unfolding and the strength of our global portfolio, we have the confidence to move our full year earnings growth from the plans we shared in November of the low end of the 15% to 20% growth range to a growth of 16% to 17% for full year fiscal year 2023.Despite the macroeconomic environment variables, we are poised to move our earnings growth guidance as it reflects the strength of our brand globally and the long-term durability that we are building through our reinvention plan. As it relates to our remaining guidance, we are pleased to reaffirm full year guidance on all other measures. As a reminder, that includes revenue growth of 10% to 12%, global comp growth near the high end of 7% to 9% and solid margin expansion. Store growth, capital spend and tax rate guidance also remain unchanged from what we shared previously. As a reminder, we expect an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of approximately 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points on fiscal year 2023 revenue and earnings, respectively.With that, let me provide further detail around our Q4. First, in regard to International. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we expect our International segment Q4 margin to expand year-over-year but to be meaningfully lower than Q3 due to seasonality along with accelerated digital and store renovation investments. Second, in regard to China, as I noted earlier, we expect China's average weekly sales to continue to sustain the growth quarter-over-quarter, resulting in average weekly sales growth of low to mid-single digits in Q4, with similar sized comp growth as the market is lapping government stimulus for customers and favorable discounting from prior year coupled with the timing of difference of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which all contributed to prior year transaction growth.We continue to expect a low to mid-single-digit comp on a full year basis, consistent with our prior guidance as well as record-breaking year of net new store development. Finally, as it relates to Channel Development, we expect revenue pressures to continue in Q4, driven largely by the at-home coffee business as customer behavior shift with revenue expected to be largely flat to prior year. However, we expect margins will continue to be above the mid-40s range, driven by seasonality, leveling to a strong mid-40s margin business for the full year. In summary, here are my key takeaways from my discussion today. Our momentum is in full swing and our strong brand, successful product innovations and financial and operational performance across the globe is a testament to our focus and our discipline.Our reinvention plan investments are unfolding and providing tangible returns throughout our business. As a result of our solid performance, our full year fiscal year 2023 guidance including revenue has been reiterated and we are confident to move our earnings growth to 16% to 17% for full year fiscal 2023. Finally, I want to say thank you to our partners around the globe for showing up every day and making customer's day brighter by extending active kindness. It's because of you that the future is truly limitless. With that, we'll open the call to Q&amp;A.

Starbucks earned a net income of $1.41 billion, or 99 cents per share, rising from last year’s comparable quarter when it made $912.9 million, or 79 cents per share. Adjusted earnings per share came to $1, topping 95 cents that Refinitiv’s survey of analysts expected.With improved productivity and higher menu prices, operating margin expanded from 15.9% to 17.3%.Same-store sales both in North America and international markets was weaker than expected. The rise of 10% was below the 11% growth that StreetAccount estimated. The U.S. and China made 61% of the coffee giant’s portfolio.Non-US same-store sales expanded 24%, below the estimated 24.2%. Like McDonald’s, Starbucks’ international growth was fueled by China whose same-store sales skyrocketed 46%. International transactions rose 21%, slightly less the expected 23%. But the average ticket was only up 2%, far below the expected 8%, suggesting that consumers are spending less.Trouble On The Domestic Front?Unlike McDonald’s whose same-store U.S. sales rose 10.3% with visits rising for the fourth straight quarter, there seems to be trouble for Starbucks at its home market. Unlike McDonald’s who reported double-digit growth for same-store sales across all three of its divisions, Starbuck’s North America same-store sales grew only 7% below the estimated 8.4%, customer traffic grew 1% at the coffee giant’s domestic market as customers were getting more sandwiches and extras like cold foam to their coffees, with the undergoing consumer trend shifting away from hot coffees to cold beverages that made three quarters of beverage orders in the U.S. With higher prices and these additions, the average ticket size jumped 6% in the region. However, transactions only rose 1%, below the expected 3%Story continuesThe loyalty app continues to grow, again gaining momentum during the reported quarter with total active members rising 15% YoY to 31.4 million.Reaffirmed Fiscal 2023 OutlookRevenue is projected to grow between 10% and 12% while adjusted EPS guidance was slightly changed from its prior range of 15% to 20% to a new window between 16% and 17%. Despite mixed results and weaker than expected sales, CEO Laxman Narasimhan remains confident of Starbucks’ strong growth narrative with multiple paths going forward on its quest to further improve its margins.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

During the integration of recently acquired businesses, the company has seen diversity in practice of the classifications of certain expenses, and the reclassification was made to better align the presentation of expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income with management’s internal reporting. The expenses reclassified from cost of sales to SG&amp;A relate to certain administrative activities conducted in production facilities and research and development. Foreign currency transaction expense was also reclassified from cost of sales to other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These reclassifications had no impact on net income, earnings per share, cash flows, segment reporting or the financial position of the Company and were retrospectively applied to all periods presented in the financial tables of this press release.Note on OrdersOrders provide near-term perspective on the company's outlook, particularly when viewed in the context of prior and future quarterly order rates. However, orders are not in themselves an indication of future performance. All comparisons are at constant currency exchange rates, with the prior year restated to the current-year rates. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, all comparisons include acquisitions in both the numerator and denominator and exclude divestitures. Diversified Industrial comparisons are on 3-month average computations and Aerospace Systems comparisons are rolling 12-month average computations.Note on Net IncomeNet income referenced in this press release is equal to net income attributable to common shareholders.Note on Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis press release contains references to non-GAAP financial information including (a) adjusted net income; (b) adjusted earnings per share; (c) adjusted segment operating margins; (d) adjusted segment operating income; and (e) organic sales growth. The adjusted net income, earnings per share, segment operating margin, segment operating income and organic sales measures are presented to allow investors and the company to meaningfully evaluate changes in net income, earnings per share and segment operating margins on a comparable basis from period to period. Comparable descriptions of record adjusted results in this release refer only to the period from the first quarter of FY2011 to the periods presented in this release. This period coincides with recast historical financial results provided in association with our FY2014 change in segment reporting. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is included in the financial tables of this press release.Forward-Looking StatementsForward-looking statements contained in this and other written and oral reports are made based on known events and circumstances at the time of release, and as such, are subject in the future to unforeseen uncertainties and risks. Often but not always, these statements may be identified from the use of forward-looking terminology such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “expects,” “targets,” “is likely,” “will,” or the negative of these terms and similar expressions, and include all statements regarding future performance, earnings projections, events or developments. Neither Parker nor any of its respective associates or directors, officers or advisers, provides any representation, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements will actually occur. Parker cautions readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. It is possible that the future performance and earnings projections of the company, including its individual segments, may differ materially from past performance or current expectations.Among other factors which may affect future performance are: changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments; disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs and changes in product mix; ability to identify acceptable strategic acquisition targets; uncertainties surrounding timing, successful completion or integration of acquisitions and similar transactions, including the integration of Meggitt PLC; the ability to successfully divest businesses planned for divestiture and realize the anticipated benefits of such divestitures; the determination to undertake business realignment activities and the expected costs thereof and, if undertaken, the ability to complete such activities and realize the anticipated cost savings from such activities; ability to implement successfully business and operating initiatives, including the timing, price and execution of share repurchases and other capital initiatives; availability, cost increases of or other limitations on our access to raw materials, component products and/or commodities if associated costs cannot be recovered in product pricing; ability to manage costs related to insurance and employee retirement and health care benefits; legal and regulatory developments and changes; compliance costs associated with environmental laws and regulations; potential supply chain and labor disruptions, including as a result of labor shortages; threats associated with international conflicts and efforts to combat terrorism and cyber security risks; uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of outstanding legal proceedings, including the outcome of any appeals; local and global political and competitive market conditions, including global reactions to U.S. trade policies, and resulting effects on sales and pricing; and global economic factors, including manufacturing activity, air travel trends, currency exchange rates, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates (including fluctuations associated with any potential credit rating decline) and credit availability; inability to obtain, or meet conditions imposed for, required governmental and regulatory approvals; changes in consumer habits and preferences; government actions, including the impact of changes in the tax laws in the United States and foreign jurisdictions and any judicial or regulatory interpretation thereof; and large scale disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, industrial accidents and pandemics. Readers should consider these forward-looking statements in light of risk factors discussed in Parker’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 and other periodic filings made with the SEC.Contact:Media -   Aidan Gormley - Director, Global Communications and Branding216-896-3258 aidan.gormley@parker.com     Financial Analysts -  Jeff Miller - Vice President, Investor Relations216-896-2708 jeffrey.miller@parker.com PARKER HANNIFIN CORPORATION - JUNE 30, 2023    CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME       (Unaudited) Three Months Ended June 30, Twelve Months Ended June 30,(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 2023  2022*  2023  2022*Net sales $5,095,943  $4,187,832  $19,065,194  $15,861,608Cost of sales  3,262,860   2,768,925   12,635,892   10,550,309Selling, general and administrative expenses 834,940   650,956   3,354,103   2,504,061Interest expense  157,176   71,270   573,894   255,252Other (income) expense, net  (62,228)  578,513   (178,359)  937,760Income before income taxes  903,195   118,168   2,679,664   1,614,226Income taxes  194,117   (10,738)  596,128   298,040Net income  709,078   128,906   2,083,536   1,316,186Less: Noncontrolling interests  122   75   600   581Net income attributable to common shareholders$708,956  $128,831  $2,082,936  $1,315,605         *Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect the income statement reclassification, as described in the attached press release.         Earnings per share attributable to common shareholders:       Basic earnings per share $5.52  $1.00  $16.23  $10.24Diluted earnings per share $5.44  $0.99  $16.04  $10.09         Average shares outstanding during period - Basic 128,440,007   128,510,429   128,367,842   128,539,387Average shares outstanding during period - Diluted 130,222,542   130,172,735   129,822,085   130,355,943                  CASH DIVIDENDS PER COMMON SHARE       (Unaudited) Three Months Ended June 30, Twelve Months Ended June 30,(Amounts in dollars)  2023   2022   2023   2022Cash dividends per common share$1.48  $1.33  $5.47  $4.42         RECONCILIATION OF ORGANIC GROWTH       (Unaudited) Three Months Ended June 30, Twelve Months Ended June 30,  2023  2022  2023  2022 Sales growth - as reported 21.7% 5.8% 20.2% 10.6%Adjustments:       Acquisitions 16.3% —% 13.1% —%Divestitures (0.6)% —% (0.4)% —%Currency(0.4)% (4.2)% (3.0)% (1.7)%Organic sales growth 6.4% 10.0% 10.5% 12.3%PARKER HANNIFIN CORPORATION - JUNE 30, 2023RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS TO ADJUSTED NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS(Unaudited) Three Months Ended June 30, Twelve Months Ended June 30,(Dollars in thousands)  2023   2022   2023   2022 Net income attributable to common shareholders$708,956  $128,831  $2,082,936  $1,315,605 Adjustments:       Acquired intangible asset amortization expense 126,296   77,073   500,713   314,450 Business realignment charges 9,226   4,946   26,706   14,757 Integration costs to achieve  18,786   1,824   95,439   4,766 Acquisition-related expenses 2,754   11,662   166,294   95,727 Loss on deal-contingent forward contracts —   619,061   389,992   1,015,426 Net gain on divestitures —   —   (362,003)  — Amortization of inventory step-up to fair value (57,992)  —   109,981   — Russia liquidation  —   —   —   20,057 Meggitt early debt retirement  9,999   —   9,999   — Tax effect of adjustments1  (26,613)  (171,921)  (222,379)  (340,258)Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders$791,412  $671,476  $2,797,678  $2,440,530          RECONCILIATION OF EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE TO ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE(Unaudited) Three Months Ended June 30, Twelve Months Ended June 30,(Amounts in dollars)  2023   2022   2023   2022 Earnings per diluted share$5.44  $0.99  $16.04  $10.09 Adjustments:       Acquired intangible asset amortization expense 0.97   0.59   3.85   2.41 Business realignment charges 0.07   0.04   0.20   0.11 Integration costs to achieve 0.14   0.01   0.73   0.04 Acquisition-related expenses 0.02   0.09   1.29   0.74 Loss on deal-contingent forward contracts —   4.76   3.00   7.79 Net gain on divestitures —   —   (2.78)  — Amortization of inventory step-up to fair value (0.45)  —   0.84   — Russia liquidation  —   —   —   0.15 Meggitt early debt retirement  0.08   —   0.08   — Tax effect of adjustments1  (0.19)  (1.32)  (1.70)  (2.61)Adjusted earnings per diluted share$6.08  $5.16  $21.55  $18.72          1This line item reflects the aggregate tax effect of all non-tax adjustments reflected in the preceding line items of the table.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Parker-Hannifin is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PH in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $5.53 per share for PH, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.50 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PH, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.50% heading into earnings season.Parker-Hannifin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseParker-Hannifin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseParker-Hannifin Corporation price-eps-surprise | Parker-Hannifin Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that PH has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Parker-Hannifin, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our discussion in the agriculture industry, head directly to 5 Best Agriculture ETFs To Buy. A July 2023 report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) predicts that global agricultural and food production will continue to grow over the next decade but at a slower rate compared to the last ten years. This slower growth is attributed to demographic factors. Despite uncertainties like geopolitical tensions, climate issues, and price volatility for agricultural inputs; crops, livestock, and fish production are projected to increase at an average annual rate of 1.1%. Food consumption is expected to rise by 1.3% per year until 2032, indicating an increase in the use of agricultural commodities as food. The projections assume a swift recovery from recent inflation and no key policy changes. However, ongoing inflationary pressures could negatively impact global food demand and production. The report also emphasizes the significance of policies to ensure greater efficiency and food security, especially in light of skyrocketing farming input prices that can burden the poor, who spend a higher proportion of their budget on food.QU Dongyu, Director-General at FAO, commented: “The broad trends outlined in this report are heading in the right direction, but need to be accelerated. Promoting a faster shift to sustainable agrifood systems will bring many benefits and help usher in better lives for all, leaving no one behind.”Don't Miss: 12 Best Energy ETFs: Top Oil, Gas and Renewable Energy FundsSimilarly, according to Mathias Cormann, Secretary-General at OECD: “Surges in agricultural input prices experienced over the last two years have raised concerns about global food security. Investments in innovation, further productivity gains and reductions in the carbon intensity of production are needed to lay the foundation for long-term food security, affordability and sustainability.”Story continuesIn terms of agricultural commodities, the report by FAO and OECD highlighted some key figures. For example, the demand for cereal production is expected to slow down, mainly because per capita food consumption of most cereals has reached saturation levels in many countries. By 2032, it is estimated that 41% of all cereals will be consumed by humans, 37% will be utilized for animal feeds, and the remaining will be used for biofuels and other industrial purposes. The growth in global crop production will be supported by advancements in plant breeding and a shift towards more efficient production techniques. Moreover, the increase in sugar consumption globally will be mainly attributed to Africa and Asia. On the other hand, high-income countries are likely to experience a continued decline in sugar consumption. Global per capita meat consumption is forecasted to increase by 0.1% per year, largely propelled by middle and lower-income countries. Fish available for food consumption is expected to grow worldwide, with the fastest growth anticipated in Africa. Poultry meat is expected to account for almost half of the increase in total meat production through 2032. Lastly, world milk production is estimated to grow at a rate of 1.5% annually over the next decade, with more than half of the increase coming from India and Pakistan. These two countries together will contribute to almost one-third of global milk output in 2032.Also Read: 11 Best AI ETFs to Invest In 2023Hunger and malnourishment continue to be significant issues, distressing more than 800 million people globally. To address this challenge, the global food network must increase food production while using fewer resources like land, energy, and water, in addition to also reducing waste. Consultants at Morgan Stanley recently identified 10 key agriculture tech sectors. The most promising sectors include alternative proteins, resource-efficient seeds, and precision agriculture, offering high growth, compelling risk-reward, and customer benefits, backed by feasible policy initiatives. Agri-food testing, animal health, and organic/naturally healthy food were also ranked well with lower risk and reasonable growth opportunities. However, innovations in crop protection and fertilizers faced skepticism due to sustainability concerns and state policies. Vertical farming and aquaculture were highlighted as potential areas to keep an eye on for future developments. On June 26, Reuters quoted Travis Parman, chief communications officer at startup AppHarvest:“There is a lot of opportunity with controlled-environment agriculture, because the U.S. is so under-built. It is a way to really de-risk our fresh fruit and vegetable production.”To benefit from the growth potential in the agriculture industry, investors often gravitate towards stocks like Corteva, Inc. (NYSE:CTVA), Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), and Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM).

That figure was pegged at 5% only months ago. Given that TSMC is the foundry to most of the chip industry the slowdown has clear implications across the industry. However, there are still several semiconductor stocks to watch.Chipmakers in the automotive, cell phone, and industrial sectors are expected to be affected negatively. However, AI chip sales are expected to be the lone bright spot in which growth should continue. The logical conclusion is that AI-oriented chip firms remain investment worthy which is exactly the thesis for the firms in this article on top semiconductor stocks to watch.Semiconductor Stocks to Watch: ASML (ASML) a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comASML (NASDAQ:ASML) has already performed very well this year. The company is the leader in a niche market that includes few competitors at all and none which can match its technological capabilities. The result is that its shares can likely move even higher. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsASML’s extreme ultraviolet technology is applied to its massive lithography machines used for the manufacture of the world’s most complex chips. No other firms are as capable as ASML in this regard. That means it essentially has a monopoly on the production and sale of these machines that cost hundreds of millions of dollars. AI chip production is an order of magnitude more difficult which only gives ASML a greater advantage. Its lithography machines are going to continue to be in higher demand as firms look to produce AI chips en masse. That’s part of the reason ASML is confident that sales will increase by 30% in 2023. In turn, that confidence serves as a signal to investors that ASML stock is a buy at this time. Semiconductor Stocks to Watch: Synopsys (SNPS) A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comStory continuesThe current race to design and produce AI chips benefits Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS). The company provides design automation software for the semiconductor industry. Synopsys’ DSO.ai product is an AI integration into the design software that searches for optimization targets in the design phase of chip manufacturing. The appeal of the product is obvious: Firms want optimized chips and Synopsys’ AI-driven software allows that to occur. Synopsys also has AI integrations for the verification and test phases of chip production, VSO.ai, and TSO.ai. Synopsys saw its revenues increase in the most recent quarter and in the most recent trailing 6 months. However, net income fell slightly as higher costs eroded margins. It hasn’t much-affected share prices at all. Instead, they’ve risen quickly following the release as it exceeded guidance. It remains one of the lesser-discussed chip stocks but one which is very much worth considering for its overall utility within the sector. Semiconductor Stocks to Watch: Applied Materials (AMAT) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) provides manufacturing equipment to the chip industry. Share prices for AMAT stock have fallen following the TSMC news, creating an opportunity. Applied Materials is a more conservative semiconductor investment overall. It includes a dividend with a yield approaching 1%. During the most recent quarter, Applied Materials returned $219 million to shareholders via that dividend. The firm also repurchased an additional $800 million of shares. It’s clear that the company is more focused on shareholders than growth relative to younger chip firms. The point is that AMAT shares offer stability and price appreciation through the growing chip market opportunity.  Revenues increased by 6% while net income increased by 3%. Those metrics suggest Applied Materials is, again, a steady choice for more risk-averse investors. Like every other chip firm, Applied Materials recognizes the transformative power of AI for its business. The firm believes parallel innovation rather than serial innovation is the path forward. That means Applied Materials believes industry cooperation will push forward its progress. Nvidia (NVDA) tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comAs I write this, Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock continues to fall the day after TSMC’s bad news. Meanwhile, the majority of other chip stocks have shown signs of a quick rebound. I think this is an obvious opportunity for Nvidia investors. TSMC already noted that AI chips are the lone bright spot it sees in terms of revenues in 2023. And Nvidia is the biggest and best AI chipmaker. It’s really a very simple choice to be bullish on NVDA shares right now. Remember, Nvidia expects roughly $11 billion in sales in Q2 which is far greater than the $7 billion Wall Street had previously been expecting. That still remains and Nvidia won’t release those earnings until Aug. 21. Shares are trading below $450 but analysts believe they could go as high as $767 in the next 12 months. Don’t be surprised if they rise dramatically again. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is set to begin an AI subscription model for 365 Office which should increase revenues. Other firms are going to drive value from AI chips as well and that means Nvidia could see even higher demand soon. AMD (AMD)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) offers a lot of potential for investors seeking a true breakout stock. Its breakout potential is all due to its competition with Nvidia in relation to AI chip dominance. It’s no secret that Nvidia is winning to this point. Its chips are regarded to be the most advanced for AI applications which have caused share prices to skyrocket in 2023. For investors looking for a challenger to that dominant position, AMD is a clear choice. That pursuit could logically see AMD share break out at some point. As a result, purchasing now is probably a smart idea. That said, let’s analyze AMD in relation to Nvidia and AI. MosaicML compared both firms’ second-best chips and found that AMD chips were roughly 80% as powerful as those from Nvidia. The company believes that further software updates should make the chips equivalent in terms of performance. The company went on to say that AMD excels at software whereas other firms have struggled. Importantly, software is one of the most powerful areas in which improvements to AI chips can be made. That further suggests that AMD is not very far behind Nvidia and that shares could soon benefit. Marvell Technology (MRVL)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comMarvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a very heavily favored chip stock. The 30 analysts with coverage of the firm are in near unanimous agreement that it is a buy. There’s nearly 10% upside implied by those prices and Marvell Technology pays a dividend so returns could be even higher. The company provides cloud-optimized chips and is one of the better data infrastructure firms in relation to semiconductors. Marvell Technology helps firms improve their data infrastructure either on-premise or through the cloud. It is also one of the chip firms that has benefited from AI this year. CEO Matt Murphy earlier stated that AI revenues will accelerate in H2 of this year. The firm’s networking chips are its main AI product and manufacturing is just ramping up. The firm expects AI revenues to double next year after production comes online fully. That should set shares up for a breakout at some point. Qualcomm (QCOM) man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comIn some sense, Qualcomm’s (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock might seem like a chipmaker to avoid on the TSMC news. TSMC was clear that it sees a slowdown in mobile phone chip production but again sees AI chip sales improving. Qualcomm is a major mobile phone chip provider. It is an integral partner of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in particular. That relationship is set to continue to be strong through 2025 even as Apple begins to transition away from Qualcomm intending to bring production in-house. iPhone sales aren’t slowing down. That means that Qualcomm should be fine. Its AI mobile phone chips are particularly strong and despite Apple’s desire to move away from Qualcomm, it isn’t that simple. Qualcomm has Apple cornered in that regard and as iPhone sales continue to be strong Qualcomm’s mobile chip sales should remain strong too. That seems to be what the market said the day after the TSMC news as shares rebounded by more than 4%. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This compares to FFO of $0.58 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of -5.36%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this lodging real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.48 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.55, delivering a surprise of 14.58%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates two times.Host Hotels , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $1.39 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.11%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.38 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Host Hotels shares have added about 14.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.2%.What's Next for Host Hotels?While Host Hotels has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Host Hotels: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.35 on $1.24 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.90 on $5.33 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Other is currently in the bottom 31% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Sotherly Hotels (SOHO), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on August 10.This real estate investment trust is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.40 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +21.2%.

Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Host delivered comparable hotel RevPAR growth of 2.7% over the second quarter of 2022, which is noteworthy given the challenging comparison of the prior year. Our results were driven by improvements in the group business segment and continued rate strength across the portfolio, despite some moderation at our resort properties. Overall, transient demand was affected by headwinds in San Francisco and Seattle and elevated international outbound travel without a corresponding increase in international inbound travel, which led to RevPAR results below our second quarter guidance range. At the same time, comparable hotel Total RevPAR grew 3.8%, which is evidence of the continued strength of out-of-room spend.”Risoleo continued, “During the second quarter, we continued to execute on our capital allocation strategy with the reopening of the transformed Ritz-Carlton, Naples and the completion of the Marriott Transformational Capital Program, further improving the quality of our iconic portfolio. In addition, we tightened our full year RevPAR growth guidance range to 7.0% to 9.0%, based on our performance for the first half of year and the macroeconomic backdrop for the second half of the year. We believe that our balance sheet, diversified portfolio, and renovated assets leave Host uniquely positioned to deliver elevated EBITDA growth in the future.”(1) NAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) per diluted share, Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel revenues are non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally, comparable hotel results and statistics include adjustments for dispositions, acquisitions and non-comparable hotels. See Hotel Operating Data for RevPAR results of the portfolio based on the Company's ownership period without these adjustments.HIGHLIGHTS:Comparable hotel Total RevPAR was $367.54 for the second quarter and $366.74 year-to-date, representing an increase of 3.8% and 16.9%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. Comparable hotel RevPAR was $225.12 in the second quarter and $221.46 year-to-date, representing an increase of 2.7% and 14.9%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022, primarily driven by an increase in average rate of 2.4% for the quarter and 3.5% year-to-date. Growth in city center markets led to the overall improvement, offsetting moderating rates at resorts in comparison to an exceptionally strong second quarter in 2022.Generated GAAP net income of $214 million in the second quarter, a decline compared to the second quarter of 2022 and reflecting GAAP operating profit margin of 17.9% for the quarter, a decrease of 580 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2022. Year-to-date, GAAP net income of $505 million reflected an increase compared to 2022, primarily due to an increase in operating profit and gain on asset sales, while GAAP operating profit margin declined 40 basis points compared to 2022 to 17.9%.Comparable hotel EBITDA was $449 million and Adjusted EBITDAre was $446 million for the second quarter, representing a decline compared to 2022 second quarter results, and reflecting a decrease in comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 440 basis points to 32.7%. Year-to-date, comparable hotel EBITDA was $888 million and Adjusted EBITDAre was $890 million.As expected, in addition to higher insurance and utility expenses, second quarter margin declines were driven by stabilized staffing levels in comparison to second quarter of 2022.Announced the reopening of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples on July 6, 2023, following restoration efforts as a result of Hurricane Ian in September 2022. The reopening introduced transformational renovations to all guestrooms and suites as well as the new tower expansion and a reimagined arrival experience. The final phase of reconstruction at the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point, the resort's waterpark, was also completed and reopened in June. As of August 2, 2023, the Company has received $113 million of property insurance proceeds from its related claims, of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs. The proceeds received to date have all been classified as property damage and no gain related to Hurricane Ian has been recognized.Completed the final project of the Marriott Transformational Capital Program with the renovation of the Washington Marriott at Metro Center. The program, which began in 2018, included extensive guestroom and public area renovations at 16 assets and finished under budget.Achieved a milestone in the Company's progress towards its renewable energy goal, resulting in a 2.5 basis point reduction in the interest rate on the outstanding term loans under the Company's sustainability-linked credit facility.Comparable hotel RevPAR for July is estimated to be $209, a 2.5% improvement over 2022.BALANCE SHEETThe Company maintains a robust balance sheet, with the following balances at June 30, 2023:Total assets of $12.4 billion.Debt balance of $4.2 billion, with an average maturity of 4.7 years, an average interest rate of 4.5%, and no significant maturities until April 2024.Total available liquidity of approximately $2.5 billion, including furniture, fixtures and equipment escrow reserves of $213 million and $1.5 billion available under the revolver portion of the credit facility.DIVIDENDSThe Company paid a second quarter common stock cash dividend of $0.15 per share, an increase of $0.03 or 25% over its first quarter dividend, on July 17, 2023 to stockholders of record on June 30, 2023. All future dividends, including any special dividends, are subject to approval by the Company’s Board of Directors.HOTEL BUSINESS MIX UPDATEThe Company’s customers fall into three broad groups: transient, group and contract business, which accounted for approximately 65%, 32%, and 3% respectively, of its 2022 room sales.The following are the results for transient, group and contract business in comparison to 2022 performance, for the Company's current portfolio:  Quarter ended June 30, 2023  Year-to-date ended June 30, 2023   Transient  Group  Contract  Transient  Group  Contract Room nights (in thousands)  1,517   1,085   174   2,849   2,123   332 Percent change in room nights vs. same period in 2022  (0.8)%  0.0%  12.6%  3.7%  22.5%  12.0%Rooms revenues (in millions) $517  $292  $33  $992  $593  $62 Percent change in revenues vs. same period in 2022  0.8%  4.2%  23.8%  6.4%  30.7%  30.2%                         CAPITAL EXPENDITURES The following presents the Company’s capital expenditures spend through the second quarter of 2023 and the forecast for full year 2023 (in millions): Year-to-date ended June 30, 2023 2023 Full Year Forecast       Actual Low-end of range High-end of rangeROI - Marriott Transformational Capital Program$18 $25 $30All other return on investment (""ROI"") projects 79  200  220Total ROI Projects 97  225  250Renewals and Replacements (""R&amp;R"") 133  275  300R&amp;R and ROI Capital expenditures 230  500  550R&amp;R - Insurable Reconstruction 93  125  175Total Capital Expenditures$323 $625 $725         2023 OUTLOOK Based on performance in the first half of the year and the macroeconomic backdrop for the second half, the Company tightened its full year comparable hotel RevPAR guidance range to 7.0% to 9.0% growth over 2022, bringing the midpoint of its full year expected RevPAR growth to 8%. At the midpoint of guidance, the Company’s full year 2023 expected RevPAR is forecast to be 5.6% above 2019.In the second half of the year, the Company expects year-over-year comparable hotel RevPAR percentage changes to be up low-single digits at the midpoint of guidance.In comparison to 2019, which the Company believes is the most relevant comparison, operating profit margins are expected to decrease 10 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to increase 40 basis points at the midpoint of guidance. However, as expected, margins declined in the second quarter in comparison to 2022, driven by closer to stable staffing levels, higher wages, insurance and utility expenses, lower attrition and cancelation fees, and occupancy below 2019 levels. The second quarter decline is expected to be the largest year-over-year decline and margins are expected to continue to moderate for the remainder of the year. In addition, the guidance range does not include any expected gains from business interruption proceeds related to Hurricane Ian at this time, as timing of any recognition is uncertain.The Company anticipates its 2023 operating results as compared to 2022 will be in the following range: Current Full Year 2023 Guidance Current Full Year 2023 Guidance Change vs. 2022 Previous Full Year 2023 Guidance Change vs. 2022 Change in Full Year 2023 Guidance to the Mid-PointComparable hotel Total RevPAR$341 to $347 7.2% to 9.0% 7.7% to 10.5% (80) bpsComparable hotel RevPAR$210 to $214 7.0% to 9.0% 7.5% to 10.5% (100) bpsTotal revenues under GAAP$5,246 to $5,338 6.9% to 8.8% 7.3% to 10.1% (80) bpsOperating profit margin under GAAP14.1% to 14.8% (170) bps to (100) bps (140) bps to (30) bps (50) bpsComparable hotel EBITDA margin29.7% to 30.1% (210) bps to (170) bps (200) bps to (130) bps (30) bps        Based upon the above parameters, the Company estimates its 2023 guidance as follows: Current Full Year 2023 Guidance Previous Full Year 2023 Guidance Change in Full Year 2023 Guidance to the Mid-Point Net income (in millions)$700 to $748 $713 to $793 $(28)Adjusted EBITDAre (in millions)$1,535 to $1,585 $1,545 to $1,625 $(25)Diluted earnings per common share$0.97 to $1.03 $0.98 to $1.09 $(0.04)NAREIT FFO per diluted share$1.82 to $1.88 $1.83 to $1.94 $(0.04)Adjusted FFO per diluted share$1.82 to $1.89 $1.84 to $1.95 $(0.04)        See the 2023 Forecast Schedules and the Notes to Financial Information for items that may affect forecast results and the Second Quarter 2023 Supplemental Financial Information for additional detail on the mid-point of full year 2023 guidance.ABOUT HOST HOTELS &amp; RESORTS Host Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc. is an S&amp;P 500 company and is the largest lodging real estate investment trust and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper-upscale hotels.

Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following: potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of RevPAR; the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions, which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and ResultsEffective January 1, 2023, the Company ceased presentation of All Owned Hotel results and returned to a comparable hotel presentation for its hotel level results. Management believes this provides investors with a better understanding of underlying growth trends for the Company’s current portfolio, without impact from properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage sustained.To facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations, we present certain operating statistics (i.e., Total RevPAR, RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses, hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, or undergone large-scale capital projects in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally, operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally, hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.Similarly, hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case, these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often, related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel, we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on property insurance and business interruption settlements on our consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.Of the 77 hotels that we owned as of June 30, 2023, 75 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following hotels that we owned as of June 30, 2023 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods, due to closure of the property:Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort &amp; Spa (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022, closed until November 2022); andThe Ritz-Carlton, Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022, closed until July 2023).Foreign Currency TranslationOperating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction, or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore, hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations, consistent with our financial statement presentation.Non-GAAP Financial Measures Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted), (ii) EBITDA, (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre, and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period, as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period, in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted NAREIT’s definition of FFO included in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization, impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs, even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement, the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share, when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT, provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.Severance Expense –In certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to, (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.In unusual circumstances, we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example, in 2017, as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our on-going operating performance and, therefore, we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.EBITDA Earnings before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate,” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition, property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.Severance Expense – In certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to, (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.In unusual circumstances, we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share, Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share, EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs, they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre, which are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense (for EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only), severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been, and will be, made and are not reflected in the EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, NAREIT FFO per diluted share, Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure, and should not be used as a measure of, amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.Similarly, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 33 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners, we do not control and, therefore, do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by outside partners, and a 15% interest held by outside partners in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and, therefore, consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating ResultsWe present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, food and beverage profit, and EBITDA (and the related margins), on a comparable hotel, or ""same store,"" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage, as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business, as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because, even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses, gains or losses on disposition, certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense, the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses, operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular, these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons, we believe comparable hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management.SOURAV GHOSH Chief Financial Officer (240) 744-5267JAIME MARCUS  Investor Relations (240) 744-5117 ir@hosthotels.comPDF available: http://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/1c57dcef-0b44-48c7-8cc9-66679bbae773]"

But now, with U.S. companies still seeking to persuade employees to return to offices, bookings have stagnated. Investors in travel companies are concerned that the spending from vacationers cannot make up the shortfall.Business trips generated as much as half of passenger revenue at U.S. airlines before the global health crisis, according to industry group Airlines for America. This helped airlines sell high-margin premium seats and fill weekday flights.For months, Alaska Air's business bookings have been 25% below pre-pandemic levels. The Seattle-based carrier said it is hopeful of finally breaking through ""the 75% recovered ceiling"" next year when companies finalize new travel budgets, but it is wary of factoring that assumption into network planning.""We are still waiting for the market to fully normalize,"" Alaska Air's chief financial officer, Shane Tackett, told Reuters. The company has been investing in leisure destinations like Mexico and Costa Rica, while its network in California remains 25% below 2019 levels.JetBlue Airways said on Tuesday it will redeploy capacity away from New York to high-margin leisure destinations with business travel demand 20% below pre-pandemic levels.Southwest Airlines is shifting the frequency of its flights from mostly short-haul business routes to medium- and long-haul routes. It will also move flights from early morning or late-night hours and cut flights on Tuesdays and Wednesdays by up to 10% compared with Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays.""I expect business to continue to come back, but it's going to trail the restoration of leisure here for a while,"" Southwest CEO Bob Jordan said on an earnings call last week.Story continuesHotels are also grappling with weak corporate demand. Marriott on Tuesday said U.S. bookings from technology and accounting firms are still down significantly compared with 2019 levels, and room bookings by large companies are recovering more slowly.Corporate travel's recovery has been led by countries in Asia-Pacific and Europe, where more people returned to offices, compared with countries like the U.S. where companies are more amenable to remote-work arrangements, according to a MasterCard report on business travel trends.SHIFT IN TRAVEL PATTERNSAirline executives say hybrid work arrangements are allowing people to combine business and leisure trips, helping carriers fill high-margin seats previously booked by corporate travelers.Delta Air Lines said revenue growth from premium cabins has been outpacing that from low-cost seats since the pandemic. American Airlines is generating higher revenue from customers combining business and leisure, prompting it to reset the terms of its contract with big corporate customers.But some investors are skeptical that consumers can continue to travel at the same blistering pace. Recent passenger screening and fare data shows U.S. travel demand has peaked, hurting the carriers' pricing power. The NYSE Arca Airline index has lost about 10% in the current quarter compared with a gain of about 3% in the S&amp;P 500 index.Valuations for travel companies remain below historical levels which reflects investor uncertainty beyond the summer, said Kevin Kopelman, an analyst covering hotels and online travel at Cowen.Some executives expect corporate travel to gather steam in September.

134,7a65bd87-e854-3feb-aac3-4d594f4fdfb6,LUV,2023-08-03,Sluggish return of business travelers forces US airlines to rejig their networks,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sluggish-return-business-travelers-forces-050100825.html,1691038860,STORY,"['ALK', 'DAL', 'JBLU', 'LUV', 'BABWF']","[By Rajesh Kumar SinghCHICAGO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - U.S. airlines are enjoying strong leisure travel demand, but corporate travelers are still not back in full force, compelling airlines to restructure their networks to account for fewer people flying for business purposes.Before the pandemic hit in 2020, corporate travel was the travel industry's cash cow. But now, with U.S. companies still seeking to persuade employees to return to offices, bookings have stagnated. Investors in travel companies are concerned that the spending from vacationers cannot make up the shortfall.Business trips generated as much as half of passenger revenue at U.S. airlines before the global health crisis, according to industry group Airlines for America. This helped airlines sell high-margin premium seats and fill weekday flights.For months, Alaska Air's business bookings have been 25% below pre-pandemic levels. The Seattle-based carrier said it is hopeful of finally breaking through ""the 75% recovered ceiling"" next year when companies finalize new travel budgets, but it is wary of factoring that assumption into network planning.""We are still waiting for the market to fully normalize,"" Alaska Air's chief financial officer, Shane Tackett, told Reuters. The company has been investing in leisure destinations like Mexico and Costa Rica, while its network in California remains 25% below 2019 levels.JetBlue Airways said on Tuesday it will redeploy capacity away from New York to high-margin leisure destinations with business travel demand 20% below pre-pandemic levels.Southwest Airlines is shifting the frequency of its flights from mostly short-haul business routes to medium- and long-haul routes. It will also move flights from early morning or late-night hours and cut flights on Tuesdays and Wednesdays by up to 10% compared with Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays.""I expect business to continue to come back, but it's going to trail the restoration of leisure here for a while,"" Southwest CEO Bob Jordan said on an earnings call last week.Story continuesHotels are also grappling with weak corporate demand. Marriott on Tuesday said U.S. bookings from technology and accounting firms are still down significantly compared with 2019 levels, and room bookings by large companies are recovering more slowly.Corporate travel's recovery has been led by countries in Asia-Pacific and Europe, where more people returned to offices, compared with countries like the U.S. where companies are more amenable to remote-work arrangements, according to a MasterCard report on business travel trends.SHIFT IN TRAVEL PATTERNSAirline executives say hybrid work arrangements are allowing people to combine business and leisure trips, helping carriers fill high-margin seats previously booked by corporate travelers.Delta Air Lines said revenue growth from premium cabins has been outpacing that from low-cost seats since the pandemic. American Airlines is generating higher revenue from customers combining business and leisure, prompting it to reset the terms of its contract with big corporate customers.But some investors are skeptical that consumers can continue to travel at the same blistering pace. Recent passenger screening and fare data shows U.S. travel demand has peaked, hurting the carriers' pricing power. The NYSE Arca Airline index has lost about 10% in the current quarter compared with a gain of about 3% in the S&amp;P 500 index.Valuations for travel companies remain below historical levels which reflects investor uncertainty beyond the summer, said Kevin Kopelman, an analyst covering hotels and online travel at Cowen.Some executives expect corporate travel to gather steam in September. Luis Gallego, CEO of British Airways owner IAG , last week said corporate traffic was showing ""some signs of recovery"" in the third quarter.Companies such as Alphabet's Google, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been pushing employees to return to offices.But as companies hold down costs in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, a full business travel recovery in 2023 and beyond is at risk, MasterCard said in its annual travel report.

To skip our detailed analysis of current market dynamics, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Bargain Stocks To Buy in August.Fitch Downgrades US Debt - AAA to AA+On August 2, Fitch Ratings downgraded the US credit rating from a long-held AAA to AA+ while holding a Stable Outlook. The downgrade came in light of the country's ""expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years, a high and growing general government debt burden, and the erosion of governance relative to 'AA' and 'AAA' rated peers over the last to decades,"" according to Fitch. In light of this downgrade, US markets have been down for the day. The S&amp;P 500 fell by 65.64 basis points, or 1.44%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 355.50 basis points, or 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite index fell by 316.56 basis points, or 2.22%, on August 2. While some are worried that this is signaling the end to the extended stock rally seen in the markets so far this year, others don't seem to be all too worried about the downgrade.On August 2, CNBC's Closing Bell showed a snippet from an earlier conversation with Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. According to Dimon, the Fitch downgrade ""doesn't really matter that much."" He also noted that while there are several countries now that are higher-rated than the US, these countries continue to live under the ""American military enterprise,"" highlighting that the US still retains its international dominance. Additionally, Liz Young, the head of investment at SoFi, also noted at CNBC's Closing Bell that this downgrade isn't a surprise, but it's also not a big deal for the US at present. The country very narrowly avoided a default two months ago, and the state of the markets and the economy continues to be volatile.Is A Pause In The Rally A Good Thing?However, this should not worry investors too much. According to Young, the pause in the stock market rally after the downgrade and the ensuing market pullback may even be healthy for the market in the long run. Finally, Josh Brown, the CEO, and co-founder of Ritholtz Wealth Management, also noted during the closing bell that before the downgrade, the average gains for the top 20 S&amp;P 500 stocks stood at around 83%, and these same stocks have fallen by about 3% on average after the Fitch downgrade. Brown believes that investors should consider this an opportunity to find stocks to go long on rather than pulling out of these companies entirely.Story continuesMost of the stocks that have been on the rise in the S&amp;P 500 so far this year include tech stocks, primarily, followed by other sectors such as consumer staples and healthcare, among more. Sectors like these that have largely been performing well in 2023 can serve as excellent investment opportunities at present since top-tier stocks in these areas are currently down. Investors can thus add these names to their portfolios at a bargain if they act fast and act smart. Companies like Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), and AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO), among several others, are considered to be some of the best bargain stocks in the market today, according to analysts. However, other stocks that have particularly begun falling in light of the Fitch downgrade may also be worth taking a look at right now. They may well be considered to be some of the best cheap stock options to buy today. Since the S&amp;P 500's top performers were the ones that took the biggest hits after the downgrade, picking them up now may also ensure that investors get some of the best stocks to buy and hold for 20 years or more. Considering the above, we have compiled a list of some good bargain stock options for investors heading into August.12 Best Bargain Stocks To Buy in AugustImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyTo select the stocks for our list, we used a stock screener to first find stocks with P/E ratios below 20.

(NYSE:HUM) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“These positive effects were somewhat offset by adverse stock selection in managed health care, where the Fund’s investments in health insurance leaders Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) and Elevance Health, Inc. were a modest drag on performance. Humana and Elevance Health were down during the quarter because of commentary from UnitedHealth Group Incorporated management indicating that medical cost trends were running at the high end of their guidance driven by higher levels of outpatient medical activity, particularly among Medicare patients.

Any number of examples between large cap tech companies and more mature companies could illustrate this very same point, but we find this specific case most interesting because of its history.Note that in late 2014/early 2015 these multiples crossed one another. The relative harmony between Alphabet and Autozone lasted for just shy of a year at that time, before Alphabet’s shares surged and Autozone’s shares slumped. This relationship need not matter for markets, though we think there is some signal for investors. Autozone today trades at the highest multiples of its recent history, while Alphabet trades at its lowest. Meanwhile, despite growth estimates dropping considerably at Alphabet and appreciating modestly at Autozone, Alphabet will outgrow Autozone by a wide margin over the next five years…” (Click here to read the full text)6.

This compares to FFO of $2.96 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of -1.03%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this shopping mall real estate investment trust would post FFO of $2.80 per share when it actually produced FFO of $2.74, delivering a surprise of -2.14%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates two times.Simon Property , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry, posted revenues of $1.37 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.26%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.28 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Simon Property shares have added about 6.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.2%.What's Next for Simon Property?While Simon Property has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Simon Property: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $2.98 on $1.35 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $11.91 on $5.43 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Retail is currently in the top 33% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Tanger Factory Outlet (SKT), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on August 3.This factory outlet mall operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Tanger Factory Outlet's revenues are expected to be $104.21 million, up 2.8% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The real estate trust has also raised its base minimum rent, which was up 3.1% in the quarter ended June 30, in order to protect margins.With student loan repayments returning in the second half of the year, discretionary spending is likely to be curtailed further.The company now expects annual net income attributable to shareholders to be between $6.39 and $6.49 per share, compared with its previous forecast between $6.45 to $6.60 per share.Data from UBS Evidence Lab showed that outlet malls have seen lower foot traffic and mall tenant categories of clothing and accessories, and food services and drinking places have seen growth rates fall below the overall retail sales level in May.This is in contrast to grocery-oriented shopping centers such as those owned by Simon Property's peer Kimco Realty, which beat quarterly revenue estimates last week.Simon Property's reported funds from operations (FFO) per share of $2.88 in the quarter ended June 30 dropped from $2.91 a year ago. Analysts on average had expected per share FFO of $2.92, as per Refinitiv data.Net revenue from lease income in the second quarter came in at $1.25 billion, in line with Street expectations.(Reporting by Juveria Tabassum; Editing by Pooja Desai and Maju Samuel)]"

Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.We determine FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (""NAREIT"") Funds From Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement. Our main business includes acquiring, owning, operating, developing, and redeveloping real estate in conjunction with the rental of retail real estate.  Gains and losses of assets incidental to our main business are included in FFO.  We determine FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sale, disposal or property insurance recoveries of, or any impairment related to, depreciable retail operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.(D)Includes our share of: -Gain on land sales of $0.1 million and $6.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $4.6 million and $6.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.-Straight-line adjustments decreased income by ($4.1) million and ($5.8) million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and ($11.8) million and ($16.1) million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.-Amortization of fair market value of leases increased (decreased) income by $0.1 million and ($0.2) million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $0.2 million and ($0.3) million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/simon-reports-second-quarter-2023-results-and-increases-full-year-2023-guidance-and-raises-quarterly-dividend-301891899.htmlSOURCE Simon]"

HUM reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $8.94, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a whisker. The bottom line grew 2.1% year over year. Its shares gained 5% in the pre-market trading session, reflecting the outperformance.HUM’s adjusted revenues advanced 14.2% year over year to $25,733 million. Yet, the top line missed the consensus mark by a whisker.The quarterly results benefited on the back of a solid individual Medicare Advantage business and expanding membership through state-based contracts. Improved per member individual Medicare Advantage premiums also contributed to the upside, which was partly offset by an elevated operating expense level.Humana Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Humana Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseHumana Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Humana Inc. QuoteOperational UpdateTotal premiums of Humana amounted to $25,495 million, which improved 14.5% year over year in the second quarter and outpaced our estimate of $24,545 million.Services revenue declined 27.5% year over year to $978 million and also missed our estimate of $987.7 million. Investment income of $274 million increased nearly six-fold year over year in the quarter under review.The benefits expense ratio came in at 86.3%, which deteriorated 50 basis points (bps) year over year due to investments related to benefit design of HUM’s products as well as increased utilization trends in the Medicare Advantage business. The operating cost ratio improved 160 bps year over year to 11.8%, thanks to divestiture of the 60% ownership interest of Humana in the Gentiva Hospice business, which was earlier known as Kindred, in August 2022.Total operating expenses of $25,311 million increased 12.8% year over year and came higher than our estimate of $24,190.8 million. The increase was mainly due to higher benefits expense.Humana reported a net income of $956 million in the second quarter, which climbed 37.2% year over year but lagged our estimate of $1,086 million.Story continuesSegmental UpdateInsuranceThe segment’s revenues rose 14.8% year over year to $25,875 million in the quarter under review, higher than our estimate of $24,902.9 million.Operating income of $1,031 million decreased 6.9% year over year and fell short of our estimate of $1,138.3 million. The benefits expense ratio deteriorated 70 bps year over year to 86.8%. The operating cost ratio of 9.9% deteriorated 50 bps year over year due to higher commissions, which had to be paid to brokers in view of the substantial membership growth witnessed in Humana’s individual Medicare Advantage business.As of Jun 30, 2023, total medical membership of the segment came in at 17.1 million. The figure dipped marginally year over year.CenterWellThe segment recorded revenues of $4,530 million in the second quarter, which inched up marginally year over year but missed our estimate of $4,532.2 million. Improved pharmacy revenues and a solid provider business provided an impetus to the segment's quarterly performance.Operating income dropped 19.8% year over year to $287 million. The segment’s operating cost ratio of 92.6% deteriorated 150 bps year over year in the quarter under review.Financial Update (as of Jun 30, 2023)Humana exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $16,214 million, which increased more than three-fold from the figure at 2022 end. Total assets of $56.5 billion climbed 31.1% from the 2022-end level.Long-term debt amounted to $9,722 million, which increased 7.6% from the figure as of Dec 31, 2022. Short-term debt came in at $2,022 million. Debt to total capitalization improved 430 bps year over year to 41% at the second-quarter end.Total stockholders’ equity of $16,834 million increased nearly 10% from the figure at 2022 end.In the first half of 2023, HUM generated operating cash flows of $9,863 million, which increased nearly eight-fold from the prior-year comparable period.Capital Deployment UpdateHumana bought back shares worth $529 million in the second quarter. It had a leftover share repurchase capacity of $2.2 billion as of Aug 1, 2023. HUM also paid out dividends of $111 million to its shareholders during the quarter under review.2023 OutlookRevenues are reaffirmed to stay within $104.4-$106.4 billion, the midpoint of which indicates an improvement of 13.5% from the 2022 figure.Adjusted EPS continue to be projected at a minimum of $28.25, which suggests growth of at least 11.9% from the 2022 figure. However, GAAP EPS is presently estimated to be a minimum of $26.91, down from the previous guidance of at least $27.88.The Insurance segment’s GAAP revenues continue to be forecasted between $101.2 billion and $102.7 billion. Revenues of the CenterWell segment, on a GAAP basis, continue to be expected within $18-$18.5 billion.Management currently projects individual Medicare Advantage membership to witness a minimum growth of 825,000 this year, up from the prior expectation of a minimum growth of 775,000.Group Medicare Advantage membership is still expected to decrease by around 60,000. Membership from the Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plan is estimated to decline by around 700,000 members, while the earlier view called for the metric to fall by around 800,000 members.The benefit ratio of the Insurance unit is reaffirmed to stay in the 86.3-87.3% band for 2023. The consolidated GAAP operating cost ratio is still anticipated to lie between 11.6% and 12.6%.Cash flow from operations is reaffirmed at around $4.5 billion this year. Meanwhile, capital expenditures are projected to be roughly $1.2 billion.2025 TargetHumana remains optimistic to attain its target of adjusted EPS of $37 in 2025.Zacks RankHumana currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

As we noted in our press release, our second quarter results were in line with our expectations. Our professional services revenue remained strong. We saw sequential and year-over-year growth in processing and maintenance. And as expected, we had license revenue for the quarter of $1.8 million. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was $15.7 million, a 3% increase compared to the second quarter of 2022. The components of our revenue for the second quarter consisted of license revenue of $1.8 million; professional services revenue of $7.4 million; processing and maintenance revenue of $5.7 million, an increase of 26%; and third-party revenue of $0.9 million. We did experience a decline in third-party revenues as our customers utilized fewer ancillary services on a year-over-year basis. Customers can perform these services themselves, contracts through third parties or we can provide these services through our direct contracts with third parties. Services include items such as customer service, statement printing, card production, network fees and compliance costs. We would like to reiterate that third-party revenues are lower margin compared to our other revenue streams, and so there is less of an impact to the bottom line. As noted in our 8-K filing last week, we signed an amendment with Goldman Sachs that, among other things, converts managed services revenue, which is a portion of our professional services revenue, from a time and materials basis to a fixed monthly fee of $1 million. We recognized a slightly higher monthly amount from this revenue stream for the first 6 months of 2023. While the partial conversion to a recurring revenue structure is beneficial from a visibility perspective, it will result in lower services revenue for the remainder of the year. As a result and combined with lower-than-expected third-party revenue, we have adjusted our guidance for the year to approximately 5% for services revenue growth. Revenue growth, excluding our largest customer, was 7% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. The slowdown from the first quarter is primarily due to lower third-party revenues as discussed previously. We continue to onboard new customers, both directly and through various partnerships we have with program managers, including programs with American Express as the network. As in previous quarters, we currently have multiple implementations and progress with new customers we expect to go live in the coming months. Processing and maintenance revenues grew 26% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022 from the recently added customers mentioned above who are now live and continued growth from existing customers. And now turning to license revenue. We recognized another license tier in the second quarter of 2023 as expected, resulting in $1.8 million of license revenue for the second quarter. We expect a new license tier in the third quarter of 2023. Professional services revenue remained strong in the second quarter. We anticipate professional services revenue in the third quarter in the range of $6.7 million to $7 million. And now turning to some additional highlights on our income statement for the second quarter of 2023. Income from operations was $2.7 million for the second quarter of 2023 compared to income from operations of $3.5 million for the same time last year. Our operating margin for the second quarter of 2023 was 17% compared to an operating margin of 23% for the same time last year. The decrease is primarily driven by hiring in India and in our Colombia office that we opened in October 2021, in addition to continued infrastructure investments in our processing environment. Our second quarter tax rate was 24.8% compared to 23.9% in the second quarter of 2022. Earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.22 compared to $0.33 for Q2 2022. As noted in our press release this morning, for the full year, we expect growth in services revenue of approximately 5% and license revenue to be between $3 million and $7 million. We expect growth from customers, excluding our largest customer which is all services revenue, to be approximately 11%. We expect license revenue in the third quarter. However, it's difficult for us to predict the timing of license revenue for the fourth quarter and beyond for reasons we've discussed previously. Within services, we continue to expect strong growth in processing and maintenance as our customers continue to grow and as we continue to onboard new customers. Professional services revenue continued to be strong in the first and second quarters. And we anticipate professional services revenue in the third quarter of 2023 to be likely in the range of $6.7 million to $7 million. The lower professional services revenue reflects the change to our Goldman contract converting a portion of the revenue to a fixed monthly fee. With that, I'll turn it over to Leland.Story continuesJames Leland StrangeOkay. Thanks, Matt. I think you covered all the essential financial things, and I'm going to talk about a few things in -- unprepared remarks but just things that people have been asking. So let me just first comment on the fact that you talked about India being part of the reason for the difference between last year and this year. I can say at this point, we have pretty much flattened the growth in the India operation based on slower growth here. We have slightly under 1,100 employees as of the end of this quarter, and that comes -- the contractors that we also use full time. I would say our full-time staff is probably about 1,000 employees. We probably have 80 contractors, most of which are full time for us, not all. And then we have maybe 20, 25 interns at the present time. So -- and in reaction to a little bit slower growth, we have taken a step of slowing things down there now. So we are continuing to spend money in 2 areas. One, the [Tesla] project that we call a potential project, which is the new CoreCard software. That's still perhaps 2 years out. Hopefully, it will be less time than that. And we're certainly going to be using some modules that we're developing in less time. In fact, we'll be doing one of those in this year. But we're going to continue to spend in that way. But the big question that I'm always asked is, what about Goldman and Apple? And where do you stand based on what they've been saying? There is some press recently that talked about Goldman is talking to American Express about taking the Apple account. I think the President of Goldman said it right when he said the GM and Apple relationship is not unilateral. I interpret that to mean that Goldman can't do whatever they want to do with those relationships without getting complete buy-in from those 2 parties. I must say in the beginning, I know nothing. As you would expect, Goldman is very quiet in terms of how they deal with these things. And the people we deal with, not only will they not tell us, but the fact is they know nothing because it's really just -- it's really handled at the very top. So everything I say now is just speculation based on my relationship and the amount of time we spent with them and also knowing about what we do and about our software. So here's what I would speculate. Well, let me back up. There's one place that I won't have to speculate. You note we filed an 8-K, I guess, a week or so ago that said that Goldman and CoreCard had an amendment to their agreement. So we extended all of our contracts for 2 years. So that will give you some indication of the relationship we have. Now part of that moved some of our revenue that was on time and materials to fixed price. And as Matt said, that's probably going to result in a little less income to us over time, but we felt like that was the right thing to do to have a 2-year contract and have recurring revenue. And in terms of a 2-year contract, it's by my opinion and I think anybody's opinion that would take more than 2 years from the time you said, ""Okay, we're going to move those contracts somewhere else to another party off of CoreCard."" So we're -- I am very, very, very comfortable that we'll be processing the Apple Card 2 years from now. Of course, it can be moved. And of course, you need to do what you need to do to keep the business, but we're doing it very well. We just had a very successful end-of-month, end-of-quarter processing of the Apple Card faster than it's ever been processed before. So we're very happy with performance. And likewise, with the contract renewal for 2 more years, we also feel very comfortable with that. Now one thing to think about on that contract has nothing to do with really licensing in the software. It's perpetual license. And as long as they add new cards, they're going to have to pay us. So it's kind of unlimited in that sense. But in terms of just the normal things we do for them is now a 2-year agreement. So what does that mean? Will they move it? It's possible. It's highly unlikely, but it's possible. And if they do move it, what happens then? Well, it's possible that a new provider will still want CoreCard to process the card. Now there are a lot of things you do outside of processing like this is the area -- these are the areas they're going to have problems with. And that's your customer service, that's disputes, basically dealing with the customer and dealing with some regulatory issues. It was not a problem with the processing that we were taking care for them. So a new -- Goldman's never done that before, by the way. So if you go to someone new such as American Express, they do that all the time. They would know how to do that as well as a lot of other people discovering a lot of folks. In fact, there are some rumors that Apple might choose a bank that -- basically a no-name bank and not put their name in big letters on the card, and then Apple would take on some of that third-party stuff. Again, I believe we will be the processor for that. Other people certainly could do the customer service and the dispute, and that's a job they do better. So that's where we stand on that. We don't believe there's a risk of that as long as we do what we're supposed to do. And as long as we do a good job for it, we don't believe there's a risk. We believe we've priced it right. We believe that we provide very, very good service. So we don't share a problem with that. That's usually what it's all about. Everybody is worried about what the press says. And I would say the next thing, obviously, growth has slowed. We're seeing big, medium-sized banks -- we don't deal with the big banks right now. But the medium-sized banks are really saying, ""We don't want anything that would get our name in the headlines. We don't want to announce a change of processors. We don't want to do anything that simply would be a -- that would cause people to take a hard look at us."" So on that (inaudible) really just been put on hold. We still have a good number of customers that are teed up. They can go buy the new point, but (inaudible) some of them are just kind of put it on hold as the current financial, economic situation picks up. One thing we are doing [next year] is that we're developing a commercial card for a mid-sized bank. So I want to say things are pretty much on hold, but there's just one situation where we're developing to their -- well, I won't say to their specification. But with their help, we're developing a new commercial card product that will go live for what we call friends and family in the fourth quarter. That simply means it will be in test. It will be used lightly. It would be rolled out in first quarter of next year. I don't expect huge revenue from that initially. We think it's a very important product for us, particularly the fact that it's being developed hand in hand with the bank as opposed to just someone come out with product specifications. And we believe it does have really good possibility, both for that good mid-sized bank as well as others in the future. So that's -- we're doing a lot of new stuff. We've got -- still have new clients coming in. They're just not getting to market as fast as we would hope they get to market. Matt, any other comments that you hear from folks? Those are the main ones that I hear that I wanted to respond to.Matthew A. WhiteYes. No, I think that covers it. I think the only thing I would add is that the -- there were 3 contracts that were extended with Goldman. One -- 2 of those were for statements of work that we have with them, and that was a 2-year extension. And then for the maintenance work that we do, that was a 3-year extension. That's the only thing I would add.James Leland StrangeOkay. So let's take it to questions now if we have any questions. As we always say, if you don't want to ask the questions here on the call, we're always open to explain whatever maybe we haven't explained that well. So operator, let's see if there are any questions for us.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Hal Goetsch with B. Riley Securities.Harold Lee GoetschMy question is, expense growth, you've had a good overview of the employee count and also like point out you had a lot of employee growth in the last 2 years or so. Do you think your expense growth here is going to be leveling out in the next year to 2 years?James Leland StrangeYes, I do. I think there's going to be some inflation impact, obviously, to payroll and expenses. But in terms of overall growth, we're not going to need to grow that a lot to take on a good bit more business. We're going to need actually fewer people working on the Goldman, Apple thing because that's running pretty smoothly. So we think we're in pretty good shape to take on more business without adding a lot. Matt, do you want to add anything to that?Matthew A. WhiteNo, that's right. There'll be some smaller increases. But overall, we're trying to keep the headcount pretty steady, and that's what we've been doing in India and kind of only adding where we need to. But we added enough people last year to where our focus is on getting those folks trained so they can contribute.Harold Lee GoetschOkay. Great. If I could ask one follow-up. Leland, you mentioned the banks don't want to do anything that gets their names in the papers. And basically, it seems to me they want to keep their risk profiles low. And what would -- should we be looking for as analysts and investors to know when that little -- that modest overhang is lifting? What will we see in the economy, what will we see in the regulatory picture based on your experience? What should we be looking for?James Leland StrangeWell, that's a good question. I need to think about that one a little bit. It's -- from an overall economic standpoint, I just think you need to -- we need the overhang that we're getting, with Fitch hitting the credit of the U.S. yesterday and with all -- I guess the market's down, S&amp;P, and they're also down almost 2%, S&amp;P down close to 1.5% today, I think you just need to be -- you don't need to see growth. You need to see some stability. It's both political and economic, just some stability so people can just say, ""Let's just get back to business as usual."" Nobody feels like it's business as usual right now.Harold Lee GoetschYes. I would agree with that. I mean, there's many, many small banks that are selling consumer credit portfolios to nonbank financials to improve their ratios. And so what you're saying makes perfect sense to me. I'll get back in the queue.Operator(Operator Instructions) There are no more questions at this time. I would like to turn it back over to management for any closing remarks.James Leland StrangeAll right. Well, we just thank you for your continued interest and support. We're going to continue to push forward. We feel pretty comfortable about where we are. We think we're moving fast at this point, but we think we're on the right path, and we'll continue. So thank you. And for any other questions along the way, please give us a call. Thank you very much. Have a great day. Bye.OperatorThank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.]"

Joining me on the call are Cameron Bready, President and CEO, and Josh Whipple, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO.Story continuesNow I’ll turn the call over to Cameron.Cameron Bready: Thanks Winnie and good morning everyone. It is a privilege to be addressing you today for the first time as Global Payments’ CEO. I have been in this role for roughly two months and am delighted with how my tenure has begun. The transition has been seamless, as expected. Our organization and team members continue to execute at a very high level, as evidenced by the outstanding second quarter results we reported this morning. Our performance for the quarter was ahead of our expectations despite what has been an uncertain macroeconomic environment globally, driven by the effectiveness of our strategy and ongoing relentless focus on execution. On a consolidated basis, we reported 7% adjusted net revenue growth while expanding adjusted operating margins 100 basis points and delivering adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% for the quarter.This includes a roughly 400 basis point headwind to adjusted earnings per share growth from the divestiture of Netspend’s consumer assets. Focusing on our merchant solutions business, we again delivered strong organic growth in the second quarter led by ongoing momentum in our technology-enabled businesses. Our software-centric strategy with an overlay of leading ecomm omni capabilities in value-added commerce-enablement solutions continues to drive our performance, and our ability to deliver these solutions across a diverse and attractive set of geographic markets worldwide further differentiates our business. Software sits at the heart of our merchant solutions business and is supported by a three-legged go-to-market integrated payment strategy spanning our partner ISV, vertical market software, and point of sale software businesses.Collectively, these businesses comprise approximately 40% of our merchant solutions adjusted net revenue and are contributing a meaningful share of the growth in the business. In our partnered ISV channel, or integrated business, as we often refer to it, we continue to deliver consistent teams growth and again achieved record sales this quarter, surpassing last quarter’s strong performance. We signed 33% more integrated merchants this period than in the second quarter of 2022. We have a long history of success in our partnered ISV business and continue to gain share despite this becoming a more crowded market over the last several years. Against that backdrop, it is important to highlight why we continue to grow and win in this space. First, we have developed a more streamlined and simplified offering for partners with the options they desire, allowing us to meet both them and their merchants where and how they want to be met.The ISV landscape has changed significantly in the last five years. Software providers desire to bring payments closer to their business and require options on the depth of integration, a clear understanding of the responsibility those depths carry with them, and the benefits of a feature-rich solution. Our simple SDKs and APIs allow us to deliver on these expectations for our ISV partners. Second, we offer three distinctive integrated payments models to our partners, allowing us to meet the unique demands of an ISV customized for its specific vertical market and merchant base. This includes a more traditional direct integrated model where we provide the most comprehensive suite of products, services and support for both the ISV and its customers.We also offer a full payment facilitation, or payfac model where the partners have access to our leading payments technologies, although much of the operating complexity, including compliance and regulatory requirements, reside with the ISV. Additionally, we recently launched our new progressive payment facilitation, or profac model, a hybrid option which provides many of the benefits of payment facilitation while minimizing the heavy burden that comes as a payfac. Our profac model is unique to Global Payments, serving as another example of our leadership in integrated payments. We have seen great interest in this proposition and have a strong pipeline of partners seeking to board in the coming quarters. Our full spectrum of integrated solutions allows us to customize our offerings and provide different levels of support based on the specific needs of our partners.Third, across all these models, we offer a higher level of service than our peers, including for our payfac and profac customers, and we also provide our partners with a breadth of commerce enablement and value-added solutions to sell into their merchant base, which meaningfully increases the revenue opportunity and accelerates growth. This includes human capital management software, payroll, loyalty, tailored marketing solutions, BNPL, and call center support, amongst others, again all customized to meet the unique needs of each partner. Overall, our technology leadership, unrivalled distribution, tailored operating model, comprehensive suite of products and capabilities, and best-in-class service and support is why we win. We meet the specific needs of our partners, which differentiates us in the marketplace and is allowing us to achieve sustainable high rates of growth at attractive margins.Turning to our vertical markets business, our approach is largely consistent with how we think about the ISV partner channel with the exception being that we control the entirety of the technology stack and monetize it accordingly. This business again delivered double digit growth this quarter led by strength in our Zego, Xenial, and school solutions businesses. Zego has seen great momentum in the student housing vertical and recently expanded its relationships with Scion, as well as another large player in this space. Zego is also partnering with our higher education business, TouchNet, to help us capture a greater portion of the student payments value chain through our campus management and one card solutions. Focusing on Xenial, we announced our partnership with the Atlanta Hawks earlier this year and are now officially live with our Xenial cloud point of sale solutions at State Farm Arena.Xenial also recently signed an agreement with Sodexo, one of the leading food service management companies globally to be its preferred point of sale and kiosk partner. With this win, Xenial is now the partner of choice for the three largest players in the food service management space. Our school solutions business had a strong quarter, achieving a new school district partnership with Oklahoma City, expanding its partnership with Baltimore County, and extending a large existing relationship with Chicago public schools for several more years. Additionally, Active recently signed the City of Toronto, its largest ever win in the community vertical and one of 14 new partnerships achieved in this space during the quarter. In vertical markets where the primary mode of competition is at the point of sale, we go to market through one ecosystem of owned POS software solutions with two distinct operating platforms, one for restaurants and one for retail.These cloud-based software solutions operate on a single hardware environment custom designed, built and branded with a modern look and feel. Our POS business grew 20%-plus again this quarter as we continue to see strong demand for our solutions and benefit from releases of product enhancements, including email marketing, customer engagement, and our latest mobile-first online ordering platform, and we expect this momentum to continue on the heels of the launch of our next generation POS platform later this year. Our latest solution provides best-in-class offerings coupled with the full local support and service capabilities to delight our merchant customers in these verticals. Importantly, our software platforms are vertically fluid, which unlike more horizontal solutions in the market offers feature-rich capabilities geared towards the specific requirements of businesses we serve with capabilities that integrate seamlessly.More to come on this. Our technology-enabled strategy is further enhanced by our differentiated ecommerce and omnichannel capabilities which we overlay across all of our businesses, channels, verticals and geographies. Today, roughly 30% of the volume in our business is ecommerce, well above the overall percentage of retail sales tied to ecommerce. We again saw mid-teens growth in ecommerce related adjusted net revenues globally in the second quarter. We continue to benefit from our ability to seamlessly blend physical and virtual worlds in more markets than our peers, supporting the strong growth trends we have seen in ecommerce across our businesses. To that end, we are pleased to have recently signed a new partnership with EasyPark Group, a global provider of digital parking services across the U.S, Canada and the U.K. Our exposure to some of the most attractive secular growth markets globally remains an important part of our strategy, both in terms of contributing to our overall rates of growth and providing us the global footprint and scale we need to support complex multinational corporations like EasyPark.Our faster growth markets again contributed to our strong performance in the quarter as we saw double digit growth in Spain, central Europe and Asia Pacific. In APAC specifically, we signed new merchant relationships with several large retailers across multiple geographies, including A.S. Watson Group, Foot Locker, and [indiscernible]. EVO aligns well with our overarching strategy, and its performance was consistent with our expectations for the quarter. We remain excited about the synergy opportunities we see as a combined company, both revenue and expense, and remain very much on track to deliver at least $125 million of run rate synergies from the transaction. Turning to issuer, we achieved mid single digit growth in the quarter consistent with our expectations and longer term targets.Transaction growth remained strong throughout the quarter led by our commercial business, highlighting ongoing recovery trends in cross-border corporate travel. Traditional accounts on file increased by approximately $10 million sequentially as we benefit from the strong growth within our existing large financial institution clients and the ongoing execution of our conversion pipeline. As yet another example of our successful strategy of aligning with market share winners, Deutsche Bank, our largest client in the [indiscernible] region, recently announced a new issuing partnership with Lufthansa for its Miles &amp; More MasterCard, one of the leading credit card portfolios in Germany and Europe. We were also delighted to assign multi-year extensions with 118 118 Money in the U.K. and another large longstanding financial institution partner here in the U.S. this quarter.We currently have eight LOIs with institutions worldwide, nearly all of which were achieved through a competitive RFP process, and several will go direct to cloud by our collaboration with AWS, our preferred issuer technology solutions partner. Our relationship with many of the most complex and sophisticated institutions globally speaks to our competitiveness well into the remainder of this decade and beyond, and our issuer conversion pipeline remains at near record post merger levels, providing further confidence in our growth trajectory well into the future. The future for our business remains very bright as we execute on our multi-year strategy to modernize our technology platforms in cloud native environments, positioning us to provide market leading technologies at scale through more distinctive and defensible distribution channels in more markets than we ever have previously.Our unique collaboration with AWS is tracking well. We now have our first client in production with our cloud native next gen analytics solution and have a number of additional customers preparing to join our cloud journey by leveraging capabilities we are launching together with AWS throughout the year. Moving to B2B, we continue to drive strong growth with both corporates and financial institutions as we leverage our capabilities across three focus segments within the overarching B2B market: software driven workflow automation, money in and money out funds flows, and employer solutions. Starting with software, our AP and AR workflow automation solutions that include integrations with the leading ERP environments continue to see great momentum.Largest Financial Services Companies by AUMPixabay/Public DomainMineralTree achieved its best bookings quarter since the acquisition, underpinning the strong growth we are seeing in our primary midmarket segment as businesses focus their attention on automating their AP processes. We also remain excited about the opportunity we now have to combine MineralTree and EVO software to create a single AP/AR solution with rich data and analytics that will provide a unique value proposition to midmarket customers. As for B2B funds flows, as one of the largest virtual cards issuers in the world, we have significant scale and all of the payment rails and capabilities necessary to support customers in making money out payments in their businesses. Virtual card use continues to expand, contributing to the nearly 20% growth achieved in our commercial business.Over the last 12 months, we issued nearly 80 million virtual cards, enabling roughly $47 billion in spend. Additionally, we are seeing strong growth on the money in side with our B2B payment acceptance solutions as more and more of this spend shifts towards digital channels. Our B2B bookings in merchant solutions have more than doubled since the fourth quarter of 2022 and we expect this momentum to continue as we further align EVO with our existing capabilities and pursue our B2B software-centric go-to-market strategy. Finally, we provide employer solutions, including our pay card, earned wage access, and expense management offerings in issuer solutions, and our human capital management and payroll solutions in our merchant business. This quarter, our pay card business signed new partnerships with Creative Mobile Technologies, a large taxi company with a significant presence in the top metropolitan cities in the U.S., and with Acara Solutions, a staffing solutions provider in the senior living vertical.Our EWA business achieved a new partnership with Bravo Foods, a large QSR franchisee in the United States. Our software-driven human capital management and payroll solutions business delivered high teens adjusted net revenue growth and mid teens new sales growth for the second quarter. We are pursuing a very similar strategy in B2B as we have in merchant solutions over the past several years. We lead with software to differentiate our capabilities and provide the vertical fluency clients demand. We integrate our payment solutions into our software to monetize payment flows, and we deliver value-added services that enrich our relationships with our clients, driving further efficiencies in their businesses while increasing our average revenue per customer.With the breadth of capabilities we have and a focused technology-enabled strategy, we could not be better positioned to capture share and accelerate growth in B2B over the long term. With that, I will turn the call over to Josh.Josh Whipple: Thanks Cameron. We are pleased with our outstanding financial performance in the second quarter, which exceeded our expectations despite what continues to be an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Specifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of 7% from the same period in the prior year. Excluding the impact of dispositions, adjusted net revenue increased 15%. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 100 basis points to 44.8%, highlighting strong and consistent execution across our businesses. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.62, an increase of 11% compared to the same period in 2022, or 15% excluding the impact of dispositions. Taking a closer look at performance by segment, merchant solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.68 billion for the second quarter, a 17% improvement from the prior year or over 9% growth excluding the impact of EVO and dispositions.As Cameron highlighted, this performance was led by the ongoing strength of our technology-enabled businesses, which grew double digits this quarter, while we also benefited from consistent low double digit growth in our factor growth markets, including Spain, central Europe, and Asia Pacific. This was partially offset by macro softness in limited geographies, including the U.K. where rising interest rates and the high inflation levels are negatively impacting consumer spending, and in Canada where GDP growth has slowed and is expected to have turned negative in the month of June. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 48.5% in the segment, which was ahead of our expectations. This represented a decline of 170 basis points due to the acquisition of EVO; however, excluding the impact of EVO and dispositions, adjusted operating margin increased 50 basis points.Our issuer solutions business produced adjusted net revenue of $505 million, reflecting 5% constant currency growth consistent with our long term targets. The core issuer business also grew mid single digits on a constant currency basis this quarter, driven by strength in volume-based revenue. As Cameron highlighted, traditional accounts on file increased by approximately $10 million sequentially as we continue to see healthy account growth with our larger consumer portfolio customers and benefit from the ongoing execution of our conversion pipeline. Transactions again grew double digits compared to the second quarter of 2022, led by commercial card transactions which increased 17%. This was partially offset, as expected, by slower growth in managed services as we continued to pivot our issuer business to more technology enablement and less lower margin outsourced call center business.Finally, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 46.7%, an increase of 300 basis points from the prior year, fueled by our top line growth and our continuing focus on driving efficiencies in the business. From a cash flow standpoint, we produced adjusted free cash flow for the quarter of $543 million, which is an approximately 80% conversion rate of adjusted net income to free cash flow. We continue to target converting roughly 100% of adjusted earnings to adjusted free cash flow for the full year, excluding roughly a five point impact of the timing change to recognizing research and development tax credits. For the year, we expect our free cash flow to follow a similar trajectory to 2022 as we benefit from seasonality and a higher conversion rate in the second half of the year.We invested $169 million in capital expenditures during the quarter and continue to expect capital investment to be approximately $630 million in 2023, consistent with our prior outlook. This quarter, we also repurchased approximately 2 million of our shares for roughly $200 million. During the quarter, we reduced outstanding debt by approximately $650 million. Our balance sheet remains healthy. We have over $2.5 billion of available liquidity and our leverage position is roughly 3.7 times currently, a reduction from the peak levels we realized upon closing of the EVO transaction. We remain on track to return to a leverage level consistent with our longer term targets in the low 3s by the end of 2023 while maintaining existing investment-grade ratings.As we highlighted last quarter, in January we established a $2 billion commercial paper program which is supported by our revolving credit agreement and allows us to further optimize our capital structure and reduce our overall cost of borrowing. At the end of the second quarter, we had $1.8 billion of commercial paper outstanding, up from $1 billion at the end of March, highlighting the attractiveness and credit quality of Global Payments. Our total indebtedness is approximately 85% fixed with a weighted average cost of debt of 3.9%. We are pleased with how our business is positioned following our first half performance, and we are raising our financial outlook for the year. We now expect reported adjusted net revenue to range from $8.660 billion to $8.735 billion, reflecting growth of 7% to 8% over 2022.This represents an increase of $25 million at the low end of the range. We continue to expect foreign currency rates to be roughly neutral for the full year. Moving to margins, we continue to forecast annual adjusted operating margin to expand by up to 120 basis points for 2023. As a reminder, this is above our cycle guidance for margin expansion of 50 to 75 basis points annually, driven by benefits to our business mix from our ongoing shift towards technology enablement and the divestiture of NetSpend, partially offset by the lower margin profile of EVO prior to full synergy realization. To provide color at the segment level, we now anticipate our merchant segment to report adjusted net revenue growth of approximately 16% for the full year.This is an increase from our prior outlook of 15% to 16%. We expect a modest decline in reported adjusted operating margin for the merchant business this year driven by the absorption of EVO Payments with its lower margin profile, consistent with our prior guidance. Specifically, we are forecasting margin contraction in the third quarter that will be followed by slight margin expansion in the fourth quarter as synergies ramp. Regarding the EVO integration, we have made substantial progress including the successful completion of our first 100 day plan and remain enthusiastic about the synergy opportunities available. Specifically, we are on track to realize the approximately $35 million in cost synergies this year that we outlined previously, driven primarily by the elimination of public company costs, facility rationalization, and the harmonization of duplicative vendor contracts.Further, I am pleased to report that we have also executable plans to achieve the run rate expense synergy target of at least $125 million within two years that we committed to at the time of the announcement. As always, we remain focused on sizing expense synergy expectations with an eye towards ensuring that we maintain momentum in the combined business and that it’s well positioned to continue to grow and expand in the future. Additionally, as we discussed last quarter, although revenue synergies have a longer tail, we continue to believe we can add at least a point or two of growth on top of EVO’s existing run rate revenue base, or approximately $10 million to $15 million of revenue synergies from the business. Moving to issuer solutions, we continue to expect to deliver adjusted net revenue growth in the 5% to 6% range for the full year compared to 2022.This outlook reflects core issuer growth of roughly 5% while we expect MineralTree and NetSpend’s B2B businesses to grow low double digits. We anticipate adjusted operating margin for the issuer business to expand by up to 60 basis points, consistent with our prior outlook, as we benefit from the natural operating leverage in the business. Turning to a couple of non-operating items, we expect net interest expense to be roughly $550 million and for our adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 19.5%, consistent with our prior guidance. For modeling purposes, we continue to assume excess cash is used to pay down indebtedness in the second half of 2023. Putting it all together, we now expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in a range of $10.35 to $10.44, reflecting growth of 11% to 12% over 2022.Excluding dispositions, adjusted earnings per share growth is expected to be 16% to 17% for 2023. Our second quarter results represent roughly a $0.03 adjusted earnings per share beat relative to our internal forecast. Our raised guidance for calendar 2023 essentially rolls the beat at the low end of the guidance range for the year, given the ongoing uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment globally. Similar to what you’ve heard from others, in July we saw stability in our performance compared to our second quarter results. While our base case outlook today resumes spending trends and a macroeconomic backdrop relatively consistent with the current environment, our guidance range accommodates the potential for a moderation in spending and overall macroeconomic environment over the remainder of the year.With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Cameron.Cameron Bready: Thanks Josh. I’ve been at Global Payments for nearly a decade, and I am more enthusiastic now than I ever have been about the opportunities in front of us. We have a compelling technology-enabled strategy, a world-class team, great partners and clients, and a global presence with diverse distribution capabilities.

This is the right strategy for our business and one that positions us well for continued growth and value creation.Second is continuing to make it as easy as possible to do business with Global Payments while providing more commerce-enablement solutions that deepen our relationships with our customers. This starts with our ongoing focus on meeting our clients and customers how and where they want to be met with innovative and distinctive solutions that integrate seamlessly, and of course we need to continue to couple this with exceptional service to ensure that we delight our customers with every interaction, leveraging our scale that many competitors simply cannot match. Third is to maintain our relentless focus on execution, which has been one of the hallmarks of Global Payments and a key component of our ability to produce consistent results through market cycles.We have good competitors in our markets, and I strongly believe the consistency of execution separates one from another. Global Payments will set the standard for execution in our space. Last and certainly not least, I am focused on ensuring Global Payments’ culture is second to none. Our culture dictates how we accomplish our goals and achieve results as an organization. It is the connective tissue that makes the organization operate effectively. Having a world-class culture will further differentiate us from our competitors, drive value creation and benefit all of our constituents.

In the fluctuating landscape of the stock market, they stand as reliable beacons, resilient even amid economic turbulence.There are two main criteria for a stock to become a Dividend Aristocrat. First, the company must be included in the prestigious S&amp;P 500 Index. Second, it must have a proven record of increasing dividends for at least a quarter of a century. These rigorous conditions ensure that investors are considering a roster of robust, trustworthy companies.Investment strategy and high-yield stocksWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with AMCR. Click here to check it out. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?The strategy is to procure these sturdy vessels when the tides recede, buying more shares at a lower price, thereby increasing your overall yield. Among these, the high-yield dividend stock category further sweetens the deal. Offering more than just consistent payouts, they bring an elevated yield potential to the table, enhancing an investor's income prospects significantly.While positive on the surface, this approach demands a thorough understanding of the market dynamics to strike the perfect balance.In this venture, I used the All-in-One Screener, an invaluable Premium feature of GuruFocus, to find Dividend Aristocrats that have a price-earnings ratio below 20 and dividend yields that are outperforming versus competitors.AmcorAmong the top results of the screener was packaging giant Amcor PLC (NYSE:AMCR). Despite a return of -18% year to date, the company remains a compelling choice for discerning investors, particularly due to its durable business model and recent strategic initiatives.Amcor plans to invest $400 million in share repurchases during the upcoming fiscal year. This cash allocation demonstrates its commitment to enhancing shareholder value and reflects management's confidence in the company's future growth prospects.Story continuesDividend yield and business resilienceThe stock repurchases bolster the companys already strong credentials of rewarding investors. According to the latest data, Amcor rewards its shareholders by paying a quarterly dividend of 12 cents, which translates to a dividend yield of 4.96%.Of the 247 companies in the packaging and containers industry, Amcor's dividend yield ranks better than 80.97%. The industry median is 2.22%.Although the company's third-quarter results showed a slight dip in revenue to $3.67 billion and net income sliding by 34% to $177 million, it is key to note the resilience inherent in Amcor's business model. As consumers tighten their purse strings during challenging economic times, they often buy smaller-sized items to stretch their resources - a trend that inadvertently stokes the demand for more packaging. This fortifies the bottom line for packaging behemoths like Amcor, evidenced by companies like Dow that attribute their growth to this trend.Strategic acquisitionMoreover, the recent acquisition of Moda Systems, a New Zealand-based automated protein packaging machine manufacturer, illuminates Amcor's foresight. This strategic move expands its product portfolio and potentially sets the stage for increased operational efficiencies going forward.Therefore, Amcor could be a prudent addition for investors with a long-term horizon and an appetite for high-dividend, low-cost stocks.Leggett &amp; PlattInvestors are constantly searching for inexpensive, high-yield prospects in the nuanced world of dividend investing. Leggett &amp; Platt Inc. (NYSE:LEG), although currently in a downturn with a year-to-date slump of 7%, fits snugly into this bracket. Despite its second-quarter results revealing an 8% drop in revenue to $1.22 billion and a sharp 43% decrease in net income to $54.2 million, it continues to have appeal as a high-dividend, low-cost stock.Business strategy and dividend growthBeing a smaller player with a market cap of $4.02 billion does not deter it from taking strategic strides. Leggett &amp; Platt is focused on innovation, with a diversified business strategy that encapsulates the bedding, flooring, textiles and auto sectors. Although experiencing a downswing, the company's proven resilience bolsters its appeal.Despite operating in a cyclical industry, Leggett &amp; Platt's commitment to dividend growth is commendable. It has upheld a rising dividend trend for an impressive 52 years, underscoring its investor-friendly approach.Dividend yield performanceFurther, Leggett &amp; Platt is renowned for its remarkable performance in the Furnishings, Fixtures &amp; Appliances industry. In a competitive field of 245 companies, Leggett &amp; Platt's dividend yield is a commendable 5.89%. This places the company in an impressive position, ranking better than 85.31% of its competitors and substantially outperforming the industry median of 2.61%. This statistic reflects the company's robust financial health and commitment to shareholder value, positioning it as a formidable player within the sector.Consequently, for smart investors navigating the choppy waters of the stock market, Leggett &amp; Platt stands out as a low-cost, high-dividend beacon that, despite current headwinds, promises to reward patience and prudence.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Over decades, Wall Street can transform you into a millionaire, but can lose you money in any given year. That’s why it’s best to be patient and buy the best dividend paying stocks over time.Dividend stocks have a proven track record of success. There is not been a single decade in the past 100 years where dividend stocks on the S&amp;P 500 lost money. Even when the index itself was negative, stocks that paid dividends generated positive returns.Yet it’s also true market downturns are excellent buying opportunities. Corrections, bear markets, and outright crashes are when you should go shopping for stocks. As Warren Buffett said, “be greedy when others are fearful.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat’s why buying dividend stocks on dips should be part of your investing routine. The following three companies are among the best income stocks you can buy today. That they are also knocked down names only makes them better.3M (MMM)3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stockSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.comIndustrial conglomerate 3M (NYSE:MMM) is currently out of favor with the market. It faces headwinds due to fears of significant legal liabilities. Best known for its Post-It Notes and Scotch brand tape, we discovered during the pandemic it was also a major manufacturer of N95 masks and respirators.However, 3M was exposed to several environmental and personal product liability lawsuits. It just agreed to settle for $10.3 billion, a claim it had contaminated drinking water with so-called “forever chemicals.” They were used in everything, from foam used by firefighters to non-stick sprays.3M also set aside as much as $1 billion for faulty military ear plugs manufactured by its Aearo subsidiary that has since gone bankrupt. Some analysts think the liability could be as high as $10 billion to $20 billion.Its consumer-facing markets are also under pressure and the company has missed earnings estimates several times. But it did just beat the consensus outlook for the second quarter and raised its bottom-line full-year guidance. Story continues3M now expects adjusted earnings of $8.60 to $9.10 per share, up from its prior range of $8.50 to $9.00 per share. That indicates, despite the headwinds, 3M remains a highly profitable company. It has a restructuring plan in place that’s gaining traction and cost-cutting measures are having a positive impact. 3M is also planning to spin off its healthcare unit at the end of the year to unlock shareholder value. The stock has an attractive valuation at just 11 times earnings and estimates. Its dividend remains secure and yields 5.5% annually. 3M has a 66-year track record of raising the payout making it a Dividend King.Hormel (HRL)Hormel Foods Logo shown on a laptop screen behind a phone screen also showing the logo. HRL stock.Source: viewimage / ShutterstockPackaged meat products maker Hormel (NYSE:HRL) is another dividend stock to buy on the dip. Shares are down 11% in 2023 as inflation pressures profit margins. The owner of brands such as Spam and Skippy has been unable to pass higher prices onto consumers so easily.The avian flu outbreak that struck the turkey industry hurt Hormel. Demand for the protein exceeds supply available, though it expects volumes to increase as the year progresses. It also anticipates the China market to recover later this year giving it two strong levers of growth to pull.The company is also willing to make acquisitions to fuel growth. It acquired the Planters snacks portfolio from Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) in 2021. After investing in what was a declining brand, Hormel saw 8% growth in the second quarter. It will also sell off businesses that don’t align with its core operation. In 2019, Hormel sold the maker of Muscle Milk to PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). It is an indication of why Hormel has not only survived but thrived. Since going public in 1928, the packaged meat maker has paid a dividend. In fact, it has made 380 consecutive quarterly dividend payments. It’s also raised the payout for 57 straight years. That’s a record any top dividend stock would want to have.Leggett &amp; Platt (LEG)A magnifying glass is focused on the logo for Leggett &amp; Platt on the company's website.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comMaking mattress innerspring coils isn’t exactly a sexy business. Yet for over a century Leggett &amp; Platt (NYSE:LEG) has been the industry leader. Founded in 1889, the company makes innerspring coils for mattresses and sofas, along with products for the auto and aerospace industries, furniture manufacturers, and flooring and textile businesses. It supplies them with mechanical and lumbar support for seats; steel mechanisms and motion hardware for chairs; and synthetic fabrics for ground stabilization, drainage protection, erosion, and weed control.That also explains why Leggett &amp; Platt’s stock is down 23% over the past year. The housing market started to fall and the auto industry has been in a rut. New mattresses and new homes go hand in hand. Bedding products account for 46% of total annual revenue. Flooring is almost a billion-dollar business for it and accounts for almost 20% of sales. So two-thirds of Leggett &amp; Platt’s revenue is tied almost exclusively to the housing market. And new car sales require having something to sit on.Yet the company has been through these ups and downs before. Housing markets always ebb and flow. Cars sales have boom and bust periods. Leggett &amp; Platt is conservatively run and has come through each calamity in fine shape.Management has paid a dividend every year since 1939 and raised the payout for 51 years. It says maintaining its position on the list of Dividend Aristocrats, or those companies on the S&amp;P 500 that have increased their payouts for 25 years or more, is an important strategic consideration. The dividend currently yields 6.2% annually. That’s one of the highest yields of any Dividend Kings.You will be able to sleep soundly owning this high yield dividend stock.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in MMM and LEG stock.

The conference ID number is 7519096. A slide presentation will accompany the prepared remarks and has been posted on the investor relations section of the Company's website. A replay will be available two hours following the conference call.Use of Non-GAAP Financial InformationThis press release contains information about Aptiv's financial results which are not presented in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, Adjusted Revenue Growth, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share and Cash Flow Before Financing are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Revenue Growth represents the year-over-year change in reported net sales relative to the comparable period, excluding the impact on net sales from currency exchange, commodity movements, acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions. Adjusted Operating Income represents net income before interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax (expense) benefit, equity income (loss), net of tax, amortization, restructuring, other acquisition and portfolio project costs (which includes costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and to plan and execute product portfolio transformation actions, including business and product acquisitions and divestitures), asset impairments and other related charges, compensation expense related to acquisitions and gains (losses) on business divestitures and other transactions. Adjusted Operating Income margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income as a percentage of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before depreciation and amortization (including asset impairments), interest expense, income tax (expense) benefit, other income (expense), net, equity income (loss), net of tax, restructuring and other special items.Adjusted Net Income represents net income attributable to Aptiv before amortization, restructuring and other special items, including the tax impact thereon. Adjusted Net Income Per Share represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the Adjusted Weighted Average Number of Diluted Shares Outstanding for the period. The Adjusted Weighted Average Number of Diluted Shares Outstanding assumes the application of the if-converted method of share dilution, if not already applied for GAAP purposes of calculating the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Cash Flow Before Financing represents cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus cash provided by (used in) investing activities, adjusted for the purchase price of business acquisitions and other transactions, the cost of significant technology investments and net proceeds from the divestiture of discontinued operations and other significant businesses.Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the Company's financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In particular, management believes Adjusted Revenue Growth, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share and Cash Flow Before Financing are useful measures in assessing the Company's ongoing financial performance that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes.Such non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the attached supplemental schedules at the end of this press release. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.About AptivAptiv is a global technology company that develops safer, greener and more connected solutions enabling a more sustainable future of mobility.

Such non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to their closest GAAP financial measure in the following schedules.Adjusted Revenue Growth: Adjusted Revenue Growth is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company's financial performance which management believes is useful to investors in assessing the Company's ongoing financial performance that, when reconciled to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measure, provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance and which may obscure underlying business results and trends. Our management utilizes Adjusted Revenue Growth in its financial decision making process, to evaluate performance of the Company and for internal reporting, planning and forecasting purposes. Adjusted Revenue Growth is defined as the year-over-year change in reported net sales relative to the comparable period, excluding the impact on net sales from currency exchange, commodity movements, acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions. Not all companies use identical calculations of Adjusted Revenue Growth, therefore this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Three Months Ended June 30, 2023Reported net sales % change28 %Less: foreign currency exchange and commodities(1) %Less: acquisitions4 %Adjusted revenue growth25 %Six Months Ended June 30, 2023Reported net sales % change22 %Less: foreign currency exchange and commodities(2) %Less: acquisitions4 %Adjusted revenue growth20 % Adjusted Operating Income: Adjusted Operating Income is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company's financial performance which management believes is useful to investors in assessing the Company's ongoing financial performance that, when reconciled to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measure, provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance and which may obscure underlying business results and trends. Our management utilizes Adjusted Operating Income in its financial decision making process, to evaluate performance of the Company and for internal reporting, planning and forecasting purposes. Management also utilizes Adjusted Operating Income as the key performance measure of segment income or loss and for planning and forecasting purposes to allocate resources to our segments, as management also believes this measure is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our operating segments. Adjusted Operating Income is defined as net income before interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax (expense) benefit, equity income (loss), net of tax, amortization, restructuring and other special items. Not all companies use identical calculations of Adjusted Operating Income, therefore this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Operating income margin represents Operating income as a percentage of net sales, and Adjusted Operating Income margin represents Adjusted Operating Income as a percentage of net sales. Consolidated Adjusted Operating IncomeThree Months Ended June 30,Six Months Ended June 30,2023202220232022($ in millions)$Margin$Margin$Margin$MarginNet income (loss) attributable to Aptiv$    242$    (45)$    404$      44Interest expense725613999Other (income) expense, net(11)25(10)64Income tax expense30166437Equity loss, net of tax7372155135Net income (loss) attributable to   noncontrolling interest4(27)7(26)Net loss attributable to redeemable   noncontrolling interest——(1)—Operating income$    4107.9 %$      972.4 %$    7587.6 %$    3534.3 %Amortization593811875Restructuring42195341Other acquisition and portfolio project costs1122511Asset impairments—3—3Other charges related to Ukraine/Russia conflict—54—54Compensation expense related to acquisitions8—13—Adjusted operating income$    53010.2 %$    2135.3 %$    9679.7 %$    5376.5 % Segment Adjusted Operating Income(in millions)Three Months Ended June 30, 2023Signal and Power SolutionsAdvanced Safety and User ExperienceTotalOperating income$                   340$                     70$                   410Amortization362359Restructuring83442Other acquisition and portfolio project costs8311Compensation expense related to acquisitions—88Adjusted operating income$                   392$                   138$                   530Depreciation and amortization (a)$                   155$                     69$                   224Three Months Ended June 30, 2022Signal and Power SolutionsAdvanced Safety and User ExperienceTotalOperating income (loss)$                   136$                   (39)$                     97Amortization37138Restructuring13619Other acquisition and portfolio project costs—22Asset impairments3—3Other charges related to Ukraine/Russia conflict54—54Adjusted operating income (loss)$                   243$                   (30)$                   213Depreciation and amortization (a)$                   148$                     45$                   193Six Months Ended June 30, 2023Signal and Power SolutionsAdvanced Safety and User ExperienceTotalOperating income$                   659$                     99$                   758Amortization7246118Restructuring153853Other acquisition and portfolio project costs20525Compensation expense related to acquisitions—1313Adjusted operating income$                   766$                   201$                   967Depreciation and amortization (a)$                   304$                   136$                   440Six Months Ended June 30, 2022Signal and Power SolutionsAdvanced Safety and User ExperienceTotalOperating income (loss)$                   393$                   (40)$                   353Amortization72375Restructuring221941Other acquisition and portfolio project costs7411Asset impairments3—3Other charges related to Ukraine/Russia conflict54—54Adjusted operating income (loss)$                   551$                   (14)$                   537Depreciation and amortization (a)$                   294$                     90$                   384(a)Includes asset impairments. Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company's financial performance which management believes is useful to investors in assessing the Company's ongoing financial performance that, when reconciled to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measure, provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance and which may obscure underlying business results and trends. Our management utilizes Adjusted EBITDA in its financial decision making process, to evaluate performance of the Company and for internal reporting, planning and forecasting purposes.

Each share of MCPS automatically converted on June 15, 2023 into 1.0754 Aptiv ordinary shares. Dividends on the MCPS were payable on a cumulative basis at an annual rate of 5.50% on the liquidation preference of $100 per share. For purposes of calculating Adjusted Net Income Per Share, the Company has excluded the MCPS cash dividends and assumed the ""if-converted"" method of share dilution (the incremental ordinary shares deemed outstanding applying the ""if-converted"" method of calculating share dilution are referred to as the ""Weighted average MCPS Converted Shares"" in the following table). The Adjusted Weighted Average Number of Diluted Shares Outstanding calculated below, assumes the conversion of all 11.5 million MCPS at the later of the beginning of the period or the time of issuance, and resulting issuance of the underlying ordinary shares applying the ""if-converted"" method on a weighted average outstanding basis for all periods subsequent to issuance of the MCPS. We believe that using the ""if-converted"" method provides additional insight to investors on the impact of the MCPS upon their conversion. Adjusted Weighted Average Number of Diluted Shares Outstanding:Three Months Ended June 30,Six Months Ended June 30,2023202220232022(in millions)Weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding272.77270.93271.97271.11Weighted average MCPS Converted Shares11.0112.3711.6812.37Adjusted weighted average number of diluted shares   outstanding283.78283.30283.65283.48 Cash Flow Before Financing: Cash Flow Before Financing is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company's liquidity which is consistent with the basis and manner in which management presents financial information for the purpose of making internal operating decisions, evaluating its liquidity and determining appropriate capital allocation strategies. Management believes this measure is useful to investors to understand how the Company's core operating activities generate and use cash. Cash Flow Before Financing is defined as cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus cash provided by (used in) investing activities, adjusted for the purchase price of business acquisitions and other transactions, the cost of significant technology investments and net proceeds from the divestiture of discontinued operations and other significant businesses. Not all companies use identical calculations of Cash Flow Before Financing, therefore this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The calculation of Cash Flow Before Financing does not reflect cash used to service debt, pay dividends or repurchase shares and, therefore, does not necessarily reflect funds available for investment or other discretionary uses. Three Months Ended June 30,Six Months Ended June 30,2023202220232022(in millions)Cash flows from operating activities:Net income$               246$               (72)$               410$                 18Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by   (used in) operating activities:Depreciation and amortization224193440384Restructuring expense, net of cash paid243—10Working capital(25)(185)(373)(752)Pension contributions(6)(5)(14)(9)Other, net7216163242Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities53595526(107)Cash flows from investing activities:Capital expenditures(222)(207)(491)(454)Proceeds from business divestitures, net of cash sold(17)—(17)—Cost of business acquisitions and other transactions, net of   cash acquired(45)—(83)(220)Proceeds from sale of technology investments—1—3Cost of technology investments—(40)(1)(41)Settlement of derivatives—5(1)4Other, net3133Net cash used in investing activities(281)(240)(590)(705)Adjusting items:Adjustment for cost of business acquisitions and other   transactions, net of cash acquired45—83220Adjustment for cost of significant technology investments—40—40Cash flow before financing$               299$             (105)$                 19$             (552) Financial Guidance: The reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided in the Company's financial guidance to the most comparable forward-looking GAAP measure is as follows: Estimated Full Year2023 (a)($ in millions)Adjusted Operating Income$Margin (b)Net income attributable to Aptiv$                            935Interest expense285Other income, net(40)Income tax expense180Equity loss, net of tax300Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (c)20Operating income$                         1,6808.4 %Amortization240Restructuring130Other acquisition and portfolio project costs45Compensation expense related to acquisitions30Adjusted operating income$                         2,12510.6 %Adjusted EBITDANet income attributable to Aptiv$                            935Interest expense285Income tax expense180Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (c)20Depreciation and amortization920EBITDA$                         2,34011.6 %Other income, net(40)Equity loss, net of tax300Restructuring130Other acquisition and portfolio project costs45Compensation expense related to acquisitions30Adjusted EBITDA$                         2,80514.0 %(a)Prepared at the estimated mid-point of the Company's financial guidance range.(b)Represents operating income, Adjusted Operating Income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, as a percentage of estimated net sales.(c)Includes portion attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest. Estimated Full Year2023 (a)Adjusted Net Income Per Share($ and shares in millions, except pershare amounts)Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders$                            905Mandatory convertible preferred share dividends30Net income attributable to Aptiv935Adjusting items:Amortization240Restructuring130Other acquisition and portfolio project costs45Compensation expense related to acquisitions30Costs associated with acquisitions and other transactions5Loss on change in fair value of publicly traded equity securities5Loss on change in fair value of equity investments without readily determinable fair value20Tax impact of adjusting items(60)Adjusted net income attributable to Aptiv$                         1,350Adjusted weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding284.00Diluted net income per share attributable to ordinary shareholders$                           3.25Adjusted net income per share$                           4.75(a)Prepared at the estimated mid-point of the Company's financial guidance range.  CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aptiv-reports-second-quarter-2023-financial-results-301892158.htmlSOURCE Aptiv PLC]"

166,8856efbf-668f-3329-9b3f-e8cb362a6982,NTRS,2023-08-03,Pension Plans Increase Focus on ESG Investing for a Sustainable Future,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pension-plans-increase-focus-esg-181500293.html,1691000100,STORY,"['NTRS', 'NTRSO']","[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / August 2, 2023 / Northern TrustThe rise of ESG investing has caused a paradigm shift in the industry. Standardization and data automation will play an integral role in ESG reporting, thus driving transparency and informed decision-making.Interest in ESG (environmental, social, governance) investing is continuing to reach new heights. While a focus on ESG has been prevalent for some time now, this surge in interest has been fueled by Canada's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and an increasing number of stakeholders who expect ESG considerations be integrated into their investment programs. As a result, sustainable investments among large Canadian pensions, spurred on by growing climate concerns and social and governance issues observed globally, went from $163 billion to $276 billion in one year.1 More importantly, the awareness of the potential impact that ESG can have on sustainable risk-adjusted returns is why plan sponsors and plan members have increasingly focused their attention on ESG investing.As the level of ESG investing has increased, the need for better, more consistent and transparent disclosure standards and regulatory frameworks has also accelerated. With that comes the necessity for higher quality data and the ability to pull together disparate data sets for investor and regulatory reporting.Net-Zero CommitmentsIn response to growing concerns about climate change, the Government of Canada made a commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.2 Following the government's commitment, several pension funds accepted the challenge. In just one year, the number of funds making public net-zero portfolio emission commitments by 2050 or sooner grew from two to nine funds.3 These commitments demonstrate the increased recognition among pension funds of the importance of implementing sustainability measures.In an effort to reach net-zero emissions, companies are turning to carbon credits. These credits are used to offset emissions and allow the owner to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) or greenhouse gases. The voluntary carbon-offset market is rapidly evolving and is expected to grow to around $250 billion by 2050 from only $2 billion in 2020.4 While these credits are intended to help companies meet their climate goals, it is imperative to ensure the quality and transparency of them in order to achieve genuine emission reductions and to avoid greenwashing. Greenwashing involves making an unsubstantiated claim to deceive consumers into believing that a company's products are environmentally friendly or have a greater positive environmental impact than they actually do.ESG Standardization EffortsCanada is taking meaningful steps toward increased standardization. Canada's 2022 budget addressed the federal government moving towards mandatory reporting of climate-related financial risks based on the international Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.5 This will require financial institutions to publish climate disclosures that align with the TCFD framework beginning in 2024, using a phased approach. The government will also be moving forward with ESG disclosure requirements for federally regulated pension plans. In addition to these new requirements, the Taxonomy Roadmap Report was developed by the Sustainable Finance Action Council. The report contains ten recommendations that address the merits, design and implementation of a green and transition finance taxonomy for Canada.6 Taxonomies can provide better standardization for benchmarking economic initiatives that align with domestic and global climate goals. A sustainable taxonomy has the potential to significantly improve ESG standardization industry wide.While the government has recently taken steps toward ESG standardization, this comes about two years after the CEOs of Canada's eight leading pension plan managers signed a statement emphasizing the importance of a more complete and consistent disclosure on ESG practices from investors and corporations.7 Pension plans have been leading the effort on industry standardization and have released yet another joint statement in June 2023. This time, eleven CEOs of Canada's largest pension fund investors issued a statement supporting the International Sustainability Standards Board's (ISSB) new reporting standards.8 The statement suggests companies in which they invest and those seeking their capital should consider these standards as they will become an increasingly important factor when making investment decisions. Additionally, the Canadian Association of Pension Supervisory Authorities (CAPSA) developed their own Guideline for pensions to follow. This Guideline provides guidance around ESG considerations in pension plan management and is intended to support plan administrators who are considering ESG factors that may be financially relevant to their plan's investments.9While there is a burgeoning interest in environmental initiatives, social considerations are just as important too. The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) recently proposed changes to corporate governance disclosure rules that would increase transparency surrounding diversity on boards and in executive officer positions.10 The proposed changes are intended to provide investors with more detailed information, allowing them to better understand the connection between diversity and an issuer's strategic decisions.Clearer VisionImplementing regulatory standards is likely the most effective way to see real change from a responsible investing standpoint. As the TCFD disclosure framework, taxonomies and CAPSA and CSA guidelines get adopted, pension funds will benefit from having a clearer vision of what securities are a fit for their portfolios and ESG goals. While the depth and scope of future ESG legislation is still to be determined, the continued discussions and emphasis on the topic, along with the growing level of investment, indicate ESG considerations are undoubtedly top of mind for regulators.ESG and Data AutomationConsistent disclosure on ESG practices by Canadian investors and corporations is a significant improvement, but it will come with further reporting requirements for plan sponsors. Institutions will need data to support their governance and oversight objectives - for example, providing evidence of their ESG scores and exposures and supporting adherence to regulatory requirements and global standards. With no standardization of ESG data or shared industry standards for analysis and reporting, this may seem like a daunting future. Fortunately, digital innovation is transforming the investment landscape and advances in data automation will be key to managing and analyzing ESG data. Next generation analytic tools can help asset owners that manage their own portfolios to complete idea generation, research management, portfolio construction, and risk management. For example, investors can include ESG as an input factor in the decision process and simulate portfolio impact across various metrics. They can perform ESG materiality assessments over time by decomposing the relevant pillars specific to each investment's industry.ESG data management is both a challenge and an opportunity for pension funds. As ESG standards continue to evolve, plan sponsors will need fundamental and diligent analysis at every level, including investment processes, compliance practices, organizational design and governance and reporting. With transparency and accountability as the foundations of ESG investing, it is paramount that sponsors demonstrate that their investments are in fact green and not greenwashed. Learning how to put data to work and relying on tools like data science to enable decisions and to communicate those decisions to stakeholders will be key.Turning to Service Partners for Data InsightsAs plan sponsors establish and refine their ESG policies, they will want to seek out service partners with advanced data analytics and reporting capabilities to provide the insight needed to evaluate their portfolios. Service partners should also be able to report how closely a portfolio is complying to a firm's ESG goals via benchmarking and scoring.As pension plans continue to drive ESG investing and as the regulatory framework becomes standardized, they will want to be sure to have access to data that meets their needs and the tools to help them maximize their information. Evaluating the right resources and partners to support their investment decisions will help them as the future evolves.1 Canadian-Pensions-Dashboard-for-Responsible-Investing-2nd-Edition.pdf (corporateknights.com)2 Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 - Canada.ca3 Canadian-Pensions-Dashboard-for-Responsible-Investing-2nd-Edition.pdf (corporateknights.com)4 Carbon Offset Market Trends and Growth: 2050 | Morgan Stanley5 budget-2022-en.pdf6 Taxonomy Roadmap Report: Advice and Recommendations (publications.gc.ca)7 Top Canada Pension Funds Ask for Better ESG Disclosure - Bloomberg8 Factiva Newsletter9 1914 (capsa-acor.org)10 Canadian securities regulators propose changes to corporate governance disclosure practices and guidelines - Canadian Securities Administrators (securities-administrators.ca)View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Northern Trust on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Northern TrustWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/northern-trustEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Northern TrustNorthern Trust, Wednesday, August 2, 2023, Press release pictureView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/771863/pension-plans-increase-focus-on-esg-investing-for-a-sustainable-future]"

This compares to earnings of $6.77 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9.32%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this oil refiner would post earnings of $3.58 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.21, delivering a surprise of 17.60%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Phillips 66 , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, posted revenues of $35.74 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.25%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $49.31 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Phillips 66 shares have added about 7.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.2%.What's Next for Phillips 66?While Phillips 66 has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Phillips 66: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Amgen The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At AmgenOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Lead Independent Director, Robert Eckert, for US$1.6m worth of shares, at about US$249 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$230. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Amgen insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does Amgen Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Amgen insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$199m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Amgen Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Amgen shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Amgen insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

PSEG's earnings release and other matters discussed during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. We will also discuss non-GAAP operating earnings, which differs from net income or net loss as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP in the United States. We include reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures and a disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements on our IR website and in today's materials.Following Ralph and Dan's prepared remarks, we will conduct a 30-minute question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Ralph LaRossa.Ralph LaRossa: Thank you, Carlotta. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to review PSEG's second quarter results. This morning, PSEG reported second quarter 2023 net income of $1.18 per share compared to net income of $0.26 per share for the second quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.70 per share compared to $0.64 per share for the second quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP results for the second quarter of 2023 and 2022 exclude items shown in Attachments 8 and 9 provided with the earnings release. Results for the second quarter and year-to-date align with our full year 2023 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.50 per share, which we reaffirmed along with our outlook for 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth through 2027 in this morning's earnings announcement.Story continuesDan will also discuss our financial results in greater detail, but this was a relatively straightforward quarter for both PSE&amp;G and PSEG Power &amp; Other results fully meeting our planning expectations and supporting full year segment guidance. We are focused on proving out the execution of our plans and grow PSEG while also increasing the predictability of our business. During the quarter, we completed PSEG's exit from offshore wind generation through the sale of our 25% equity stake in Ocean Wind 1 back to Ørsted, recovering our investment in the project. We also continue to implement the solutions we outlined to address pension variability. PSEG recently executed an agreement for a pension lift-out to further reduce prospective earnings variability.This transaction covers approximately 2,000 retirees and will transfer approximately $1 billion of related obligations and associated plan assets to the insurer. The transaction expected to be completed this month will result in no changes to the amount of benefits payable for the retirees and have no material impact on PSEG's non-GAAP operating earnings in 2023. Turning now to PSEG's capital spending plans. The utility portion of $15.5 billion to $18 billion remains focused on system modernization of our aging distribution infrastructure, Last Mile support in preparation for EV and building electrification, climate mitigation aligned with New Jersey's energy policies and our clean energy investments. PSE&amp;G's investment program drives our expected compound annual growth rate and rate base of 6% to 7.5% from year-end 2022 to year-end 2027.The low end of this rate base CAGR assumes an extension of our gas system modernization program and our clean energy investments at their current average annual levels. While the upper end includes an extension of our Energy Strong II program, which is scheduled to conclude in 2024 as well as the remaining portion of our proposal for medium- and heavy-duty EVs and energy storage programs as well as a potentially higher amount of investment for GSMP and energy efficiency above current levels. With this robust capital program, we are ever mindful of customers' affordability. And on this front, PSE&amp;G continues to compare well to peers on a share of wallet basis, both in the region as well as nationally. I mentioned in the last quarter that our 2023 utility capital spending budget of $3.5 billion was the largest single year plan in our history.During the second quarter, we invested approximately $900 million, bringing us to $1.7 billion year-to-date and midyear. We are on schedule and on budget. In fact, PSE&amp;G just installed its 1 million smart meters out of 2.3 million that we have planned, and we continue to notice higher spend on electric -- new business related to electric vehicles and strong demand for our energy efficiency solutions. Speaking of energy efficiency, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities recently approved its second energy efficiency framework for the next 3-year cycle that will begin in July of 2024 and run through June of 2027. This past May, the BPU approved a $280 million 9-month extension of PSEG's first energy efficiency program to sync us up with the completion of the state's first cycle in June of 2024.You may recall that PSE&amp;G started its energy efficiency programs earlier than the other New Jersey utilities bid. The BPU's new framework sets up guidelines for the next round of energy efficiency plans, which are now due this October for implementation in July of 2024. The energy efficiency annual reduction goals of 0.75% for gas and 2% for electric for program years '26 and '27 remain unchanged. The BPU also approved the performance incentive mechanism to drive energy efficiency above the preset goals. On the gas side of the utility, PSE&amp;G filed the third phase of its gas system modernization program during the first quarter of 2023, which remains pending with the BPU. Through our gas system monetization program, we reduced methane release by approximately 22% system-wide.And assuming the extension at similar to current levels, we expect to achieve an overall reduction in methane emissions of at least 60% over the 2011 to 2030 period. There is also good news for customer bills for this coming winter. Following 2 basic gas supply service commodity charge reductions this past heating season, our recently filed BGSS rate proposes a reduction from $0.47 to $0.40 per therm. If approved by the BPU, the new rate will keep PSE&amp;G's monthly bill for typical residential gas customers among the lowest in the region for the upcoming 2024 heating season. The BPU's future of natural gas stakeholder proceeding will also start this month, and we expect to participate in the upcoming technical conference and on follow-up meetings as New Jersey achieves its emission reduction targets, which will also will be considering the impact on costs and jobs.Kim Hanemann, President of PSE&amp;G is already actively involved in the state's clean buildings working group that is considering various approaches to building electrification, including the development of Clean Heat Standard. Our overall approach to energy transition is to continue advocating for practical expansion of electrification in a manner which protects customer affordability, safety and reliability. We are having impactful conversations with PJM, our regional grid operator and our New Jersey stakeholders to increase the coordination and understanding of our relative perspectives on future load growth and the investment needed in existing T&amp;D infrastructure to meet even a diluted version of New Jersey energy transition. Now turning to nuclear operations.The PSEG nuclear fleet continues to safely generate the majority of New Jersey's carbon-free baseload electricity. During the first half of 2023, our nuclear units generated over 16 terawatt hours of electricity and operated at capacity factor of 95.8%. Charles McFeaters, who many of you met at our March investor conference, was promoted to Chief Nuclear Officer during the quarter in a seamless and well-planned transition that included the Salem 2 refueling outage completed on schedule and on budget. The Power &amp; other portion of PSEG's 5-year capital program is a significantly smaller amount of PSEG's total, mainly reflecting basic nuclear capital spending, but does include several low-cost, high-impact projects like the Hope Creek transition from 18 months to 24-month refueling cycles.So just to wrap up what I believe is a quarter that delivers on what we have committed to you, we are reiterating our full year non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.50 per share. Second, we continue to make progress on building our earnings growth platform by keeping our largest-ever capital program on track, financed with a strong balance sheet without the need for new equity or asset sales through 2027. And this financial strength gives us confidence in our long-term 5% to 7% growth rate in non-GAAP operating earnings through 2027 and supports our ability to pay a competitive and growing dividend, as we have for 116 years. Third, we increased the predictability of our financial results by streamlining the business with the completed offshore wind sale and delivering progress on reducing pension variability with the lift-out.Finally, we are working to keep our customer bills affordable during the energy transition with help from stringent cost controls and a culture of continuous improvement. Moving out the execution of our strategy and maintaining a safe and reliable network operations, that is what you can expect from this team. I'll now turn the call over to Dan for more details on the operating results, and I will be available for your questions after his remarks.Electricity, Electriceliza-diamond-Iw2oRD2NP2w-unsplashDaniel Cregg: Great. Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everybody. Earlier, Ralph mentioned that PSEG reported net income of $591 million or $1.18 per share for the second quarter of 2023 compared to net income of $131 million or $0.26 per share for the second quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the second quarter of 2023 were $351 million or $0.70 per share compared to $320 million or $0.64 per share for the second quarter of 2022. We've provided you with information on Slides 9 and 11 regarding the contribution to non-GAAP operating earnings per share by business for the second quarter and year-to-date periods and Slides 10 and 12 contain waterfall charts that take you through the net changes for the quarter-over-quarter and year-to-date periods in non-GAAP operating earnings per share by major business.Starting with PSE&amp;G, which reported second quarter 2023 net income of $336 million or $0.67 per share. This compares to $305 million or $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2022. The second quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating earnings were $341 million or $0.68 per share compared to $305 million or $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2022. The main drivers for both GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter were growth in rate base reflected in higher transmission formula rate, recovery of infrastructure investments with roll-in mechanisms and a benefit from the reversal and timing of taxes, which we mentioned on the first quarter call, nets to 0 over the course of the year. These favorable items were partly offset by our anticipated lower pension income and OPEB credits, along with higher depreciation and interest expense from increased investment versus the year earlier quarter.Compared to the second quarter of 2022, transmission was $0.02 per share higher, gas margin was $0.01 per share higher driven by the clause recovery of GSMP investment. Electric margin was $0.01 per share higher, reflecting investment returns from Energy Strong and other electric and gas margin added $0.02 per share based on a benefit from the tax adjustment credit and appliance service results. Lower distribution O&amp;M expense added $0.02 per share compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily reflecting reduced weather-related corrective maintenance. Depreciation and interest expense increased by $0.01 and $0.02 per share, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2022, reflecting continued growth in investment. Lower pension income resulting from 2022's investment returns, combined with lower OPEB credits scheduled to end in 2023, resulted in a $0.04 per share unfavorable comparison to the year earlier quarter.Lastly, the timing of taxes recorded through an effective tax rate, which nets to 0 over a full year and other flow-through taxes had a net favorable impact of $0.06 per share in the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter weather typically contains both heating and cooling sales. For 2023, winter weather during the second quarter was 23% warmer in terms of heating degree days than the second quarter of 2022, and summer weather was 34% cooler than second quarter 2022 as measured by the temperature humidity index. As we've mentioned, the SIP mechanism in effect since 2021, limits the impact of weather and other sales variances, positive or negative on electric and gas margins while importantly, enabling PSE&amp;G to promote the widespread adoption of its energy efficiency programs.Growth in the number of electric and gas customers, the driver of margin under the SIP mechanism continues to be positive and were each up 1% during the trailing 12-month period. On capital spending, PSE&amp;G invested $900 million during the second quarter and is on plan to deliver its largest annual capital investment program at $3.5 billion. The program includes upgrades to our T&amp;D facilities, Energy Strong II investments, last mile spend in the infrastructure advancement program and the continued rollout of the clean energy investments in energy efficiency and the Energy Cloud, including smart meters. Related to our pension, in February 2023, the BPU approved an accounting order authorizing PSE&amp;G to modify its method for calculating the amortization of the net actuarial gain or loss component for ratemaking purposes.This change is effective for the calendar year ending December 31, 2023 and forward. For the full year 2023, PSE&amp;G's forecast of non-GAAP operating earnings is unchanged at $1.500 billion to $1.525 billion. Moving on to Power &amp; Other. Just as a reminder, Power &amp; Other includes our nuclear fleet, gas operations, Long Island and parent activities, including interest expense. For the second quarter of 2023, PSEG Power &amp; Other reported net income of $255 million or $0.51 per share and non-GAAP operating earnings of $10 million or $0.02 per share. This compares to second quarter 2022 net loss of $174 million or $0.35 per share and non-GAAP operating earnings of $15 million or $0.03 per share. We previously mentioned that during the first quarter of 2023, PSEG Power realized the majority of the approximate $4 per megawatt hour increase in the average price of our 2023 hedged output, which rose to approximately $31 per megawatt hour with higher winter pricing driving most of the increase.For the second quarter of 2023, gross margin rose by a total of $0.05 per share reflecting the absence of certain full requirement BGS load contracts that remain following the sale of the fossil business in 2022 and resulted in a lower cost to serve compared to the prior year. The increase in gross margin includes higher generation of $0.01 per share from fewer refueling outage days in the second quarter of 2023, offset by lower capacity revenues of $0.01 per share compared to the year ago quarter. O&amp;M cost comparisons in the second quarter improved by $0.01 per share in 2023. Higher interest expense covering PSEG Power and parent financings were $0.02 per share unfavorable compared to the year ago quarter from higher variable rates on term loans and refinancing maturing debt at higher rates.Lower pension income from 2022 investment returns and OPEB credits from the lower amortization benefit mentioned earlier were $0.03 per share unfavorable versus the second quarter of 2022. And taxes and other were $0.02 per share unfavorable compared to the second quarter of 2022, reflecting a partial reversal of the effective tax rate benefit from the first quarter and lower investment income. On the operating side, the nuclear fleet produced approximately 7.7 terawatt hours during the second quarter and 16 terawatt hours for the year-to-date period in 2023, running at a capacity factor of 91.2% for the quarter and 95.8% for the year-to-date period. For the full year 2023, PSEG is forecasting generation output of 30 to 32 terawatt hours and has hedged approximately 95% to 100% of this production at an average price of $31 per megawatt hour.For 2024, the nuclear fleet is forecasted to produce 30 to 32 terawatt hours of baseload output and has hedged 75% to 80% of this generation at an average price of $38 per megawatt hour. The forecast of non-GAAP operating earnings for PSEG Power and other is unchanged at $200 million to $225 million for the full year. This forecast reflects the realization of a majority of the expected increase in the average 2023 annual hedge price in the first quarter of '23, as we previously discussed. Touching on some recent financing activity. As of June 30, 2023, PSEG had total available liquidity of $4 billion, including $500 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. PSEG Power had net cash collateral postings of approximately $400 million at June 30, which is well below the levels experienced during 2022.Through the second quarter, we've repaid $2 billion of term loans, which were entered into during 2022 to support our collateral needs. In April, we entered into a $750 million 364-day variable rate term loan to support our liquidity needs. As of June 30, 2023, PSEG had $750 million outstanding of a 364-day variable rate term loan and PSEG Power had $1.25 billion outstanding of a variable rate term loan maturing March of 2025. As of the end of the quarter, PSEG had swapped $900 million of the power term loan from a variable rate to a fixed rate. And in May, PSE&amp;G paid at maturity $500 million of secured medium-term notes. As Ralph mentioned earlier, PSEG recently executed an agreement for a pension lift-out that will further increase the predictability of our financial results.This transaction covers approximately 2,000 retirees from PSEG Power &amp; Other, and will transfer approximately $1 billion of related obligations and associated plan assets. This transaction will have no material impact on PSEG's non-GAAP operating earnings in 2023. Upon completion of the pension lift-out, we anticipate taking a onetime noncash settlement charge in the third quarter of 2023 related to the immediate recognition of unamortized net actuarial loss associated with a portion of the pension involved in the transaction. After providing for the effect of this transaction, our pension plans remain well funded. As Ralph mentioned, we are reaffirming PSEG's full year 2023 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.50 per share, with PSE&amp;G forecasted to contribute between $1.500 billion to $1.525 billion and PSEG Power &amp; Other forecasted at $200 million to $225 million.The settlement charge related to the lift-out is not included in the full year 2023 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance for PSEG, PSE&amp;G or PSEG Power &amp; Other. That concludes our formal remarks. And operator, we are ready to begin the question-and-answer session.See also 50 Perf Award Winnersume In The Last 10 Years and 20 Cheapest Countries to Live in Europe.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

According to a study from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, the shares are within 2% of its 40-day moving average. The study shows five similar occurrences over the past three years. The stock was higher one month after 40% of these signals, averaging a 5.1% pop.

This compares to loss of $0.25 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 60%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this biotechnology company would post a loss of $0.24 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.18, delivering a surprise of 25%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Aurinia , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry, posted revenues of $41.49 million for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14.10%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $28.19 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Aurinia shares have added about 134.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 17.6%.What's Next for Aurinia?While Aurinia has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Aurinia: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

In the last reported quarter, the utility delivered an earnings surprise of 1.02%.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the upcoming earnings announcement.Factors to NoteDominion Energy’s second-quarter earnings are likely to have benefited from regulated investments, higher sales volume and efficient cost management. During the quarter, Dominion Energy started hydrogen blending projects in Utah and Ohio to assist in reducing emissions.However, extremely mild weather conditions in the company's electric service regions (compared with the 15-year average) are anticipated to have reduced operating earnings by 7-9 cents per share in the second quarter.The planned outage of Millstone Power Station Unit 2 lasted longer than expected and Millstone Power Station Unit 3 had an automatic reactor trip, both of which had an adverse impact on earnings in the second quarter.ExpectationsDominion Energy lowered its earnings expectations to a range of 44-50 cents per share from an earlier announced range of 58-68 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at 48 cents, indicating a decline of 37.66% from the year-ago reported figure.Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Dominion Energy this time around.

194,8f33d4c0-c744-338b-b540-72b5f5a914d5,MAS,2023-08-03,Time to Add These 5 Relative Price Strength Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-add-5-relative-price-113700785.html,1690976220,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'MAS', 'OPCH', 'COOP', 'SOI', 'PHM']","[Wall Street experienced a strong rebound in the first seven months of 2023, recovering from the disappointments of the previous year. The S&amp;P 500 Index surged nearly 20% during this period. This positive performance can be attributed to the steady decline in inflation rates, a strong labor market and the Federal Reserve's decision to reduce the magnitude of interest rate hikes. The bullish sentiment has even led to U.S. consumer sentiment jumping to the highest level in almost two years.In particular, the inflation rate is dwindling steadily since June 2022. Consequently, the Fed is approaching the end of its ongoing interest rate hike cycle. The central bank is now more confident about the soft landing of the economy. This could mean a brightening outlook for the stock market.Investors who want to take advantage of the bullish equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyInvestors generally gauge a stock’s potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples. At the same time, it’s essential to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or an appropriate benchmark. If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors, it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance of providing considerable returns. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Story continuesScreening ParametersRelative % Price change – 12 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 4 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 1 week greater than 0(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current-quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks — that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years — can get through.

The country will also need to adeptly utilize both multilateral and bilateral relationships and affiliations to transition from being a ""balancing power"" to being a ""leading power"", while fostering trading partnerships in all regions.India's ability to become a major global manufacturing hub will be a paramount test for its economic future. Developing a strong logistics framework will be key in transforming India from a services-dominated economy to a manufacturing-dominant one. Additionally, upskilling workers and increasing female participation in the workforce will be crucial for India to realize its demographic dividend.Highlights from Look Forward: India's Moment include:India has come out of the pandemic reasonably well, with GDP growth of 7.2% in fiscal year 2023. We expect India to grow 6.7% per year from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2031, catapulting GDP to $6.7 trillion from $3.4 trillion in fiscal 2023. Per capita GDP will rise to about $4,500.India's short-term economic growth will stand on the shoulders of its 678.6 million strong labor force. Getting more women to enter the workforce will be pivotal for future growth, as only 24% were participating in 2022.India has an immense opportunity to increase its share of global manufacturing exports, and the government is seeking to raise manufacturing to 25% of GDP from 17.7% by 2025.With domestic energy demand set to double by 2050, India will prepare for an energy future that aims to strike a balance between increasing energy access and reliability, while securing affordable supplies and diversifying its fuel mix.Share of venture capital flowing into Indian startups will double by 2030; newer verticals to benefit include EVs, space technology, AI, drones, robotics and clean technology.Based on analysis of S&amp;P Global environmental, social and governance data, nearly 40% of India-headquartered companies conduct physical risk assessments, and one-third of large Indian companies rate climate strategy as one of their top three material issues.For more insights from Look Forward India's Moment (Volume 3 | August 2023) and to read the full report, please visit: https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/featured/special-editorial/look-forward/look-forward-volume-3-2023This is the 3rd Volume of the Look Forward research series from the S&amp;P Global Research Council.

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, the Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) share price is up 96% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 53% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 14% , including dividends .So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for Mastercard In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Mastercard achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 19% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 14% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Mastercard's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Mastercard the TSR over the last 5 years was 101%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Mastercard has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 14% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, that falls short of the 15% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Mastercard better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Mastercard   you should know about.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

211,8f33d4c0-c744-338b-b540-72b5f5a914d5,PHM,2023-08-03,Time to Add These 5 Relative Price Strength Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-add-5-relative-price-113700785.html,1690976220,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'MAS', 'OPCH', 'COOP', 'SOI', 'PHM']","[Wall Street experienced a strong rebound in the first seven months of 2023, recovering from the disappointments of the previous year. The S&amp;P 500 Index surged nearly 20% during this period. This positive performance can be attributed to the steady decline in inflation rates, a strong labor market and the Federal Reserve's decision to reduce the magnitude of interest rate hikes. The bullish sentiment has even led to U.S. consumer sentiment jumping to the highest level in almost two years.In particular, the inflation rate is dwindling steadily since June 2022. Consequently, the Fed is approaching the end of its ongoing interest rate hike cycle. The central bank is now more confident about the soft landing of the economy. This could mean a brightening outlook for the stock market.Investors who want to take advantage of the bullish equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyInvestors generally gauge a stock’s potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples. At the same time, it’s essential to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or an appropriate benchmark. If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors, it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance of providing considerable returns. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Story continuesScreening ParametersRelative % Price change – 12 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 4 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 1 week greater than 0(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current-quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks — that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years — can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price greater than or equal to $5 and Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A minimum price of $5 is a good standard to screen low-priced stocks, while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity.VGM Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 22 stocks that made it through the screen:Mr. Cooper Group COOP: The company operates in the mortgage refinancing market.

J&amp;J has said its talc products are safe and do not contain asbestos.During a Wednesday court hearing, LTL attorney Greg Gordon countered that the company would ""strongly resist"" any request to ""pre-judge"" a potential future bankruptcy before it could be filed.But David Molton, an attorney for the official committee representing cancer claimants in LTL's bankruptcy, said that a temporary prohibition on new bankruptcy filings was appropriate, given LTL's repeated bankruptcy filings.Kaplan, who dismissed LTL's second bankruptcy, said he was not inclined to block future bankruptcy filings because circumstances could change in the next six months. ""I just don't have a crystal ball,"" Kaplan said.But the judge said he was open to further written arguments on that point before issuing a formal decision closing LTL's second bankruptcy case next week.J&amp;J's first bankruptcy gambit began in 2021, when it offloaded its talc liabilities into a new company via a corporate division known as a ""Texas two-step"" and immediately placed the new company into bankruptcy.LTL's first bankruptcy was dismissed in April after a U.S. appeals court ruled that it was not in sufficient financial distress to be eligible for bankruptcy protection.LTL's second effort, premised on a proposed $8.9 billion settlement of current and future talc lawsuits, met the same fate after Kaplan ruled that the company was still not in the kind of ""immediate"" distress required by the appellate court's ruling.

Earnings rose 117% year over year on the back of strong product sales.Revenues in the reported quarter were $596.5 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $532.3 million. Revenues rose 28% year over year, driven by Tyvaso sales.Quarter in DetailUnited Therapeutics markets four products for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — Remodulin, Tyvaso, Adcirca and Orenitram. It also markets Unituxin for treating pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.Tyvaso sales totaled $318.9 million, up 59% year over year, gaining from higher sales volume, driven by the launch of Tyvaso dry powder inhalation (DPI) formulation last year. Net sales also rose on account of increased product uptake following label expansion of the drug in pulmonary hypertension associated with the interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD) indication in 2021.Tyvaso sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $259 million and our model estimates of $278 million.Shares of United Therapeutics were up 8.3% in response to the better-than-expected Q2 results and encouraging Tyvaso uptake. Yet, the stock has declined 13.7% in the year so far compared with the industry’s breakeven growth.United Therapeutics developed Tyvaso DPI in partnership with MannKind Corporation MNKD. Per anexisting commercial supply agreement, MannKind Corporation manufactures and supplies Tyvaso DPI to United Therapeutics.The demand trends of Tyvaso remain strong and the company continues to see new patient growth. United Therapeutics is working with partner MannKind to increase DPI production capacity to meet this increased demand. Until the company meets the increased demand, it expects sales to be hurt due to fluctuations in Tyvaso DPI’s inventory levels held by distributors.Remodulin (including Remunity Pump) sales declined 4% year over year to $127.2 million, while Orenitram sales rose 20% year over year, amounting to $95.1 million.Story continuesUnituxin sales were flat year over year at $44.3 million. Adcirca sales were $7.5 million, down 28% year over year.Research and development expenses were $89.0 million in the quarter, down 5% year over year. Selling, general and administrative expenses fell 8% to $130.0 million in the quarter.Pipeline UpdateUnited Therapeutics is working on expanded indications for Orenitram and Tyvaso. Some phase III studies are ongoing across various forms of PH and pulmonary fibrosis indications.Key phase III programs include Tyvaso in patients with various forms of chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease (TETON studies) and oral ralinepag (PAH — ADVANCE CAPACITY and ADVANCE OUTCOMES studies).The late-stage TETON 1 study in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) currently enrolls patients at sites in the United States and Canada. The second phase III study of Tyvaso in IPF patients, TETON 2, initiated in October 2022, is being conducted outside of the United States and Canada. If the drug is approved for the IPF indication, management expects Tyvaso sales in IPF to exceed the drug’s sales in the PAH indication. Enrollment is ongoing in the ADVANCE CAPACITY and ADVANCE OUTCOMES studies.Last month, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the District Court’s decision favoring the company in its patent litigations with Liquidia Technologies over the validity of a Tyvaso patent. As a result, the FDA cannot grant final approval to Liquidia’s Yutrepia until the Tyvaso patent expires in May 2027.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksUnited Therapeuticscurrently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

J&amp;J, which denies the claims, had offered a settlement of $8.9 billion.The judge ruled that J&amp;J affiliate LTL Management LLC, which was formed strictly to absorb the talc claims in a maneuver known as the “Texas two-step,” wasn’t in immediate ""financial distress"" and therefore could not qualify for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.J&amp;J is not the only company hoping to use the bankruptcy of an affiliate or subsidiary to settle mass liabilities. 3M and Georgia-Pacific are similarly trying to offload hundreds of thousands of injury claims using versions of the technique.Those efforts have drawn challenges in multiple jurisdictions, with varying outcomes, leading some legal experts to expect the US Supreme Court to take up the issue.“The trend is against using the Texas two-step,” said former bankruptcy judge and Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law professor Bruce Markell.Johnson &amp; Johnson's baby powder on a supermarket shelf in 2017. (FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images) (AFP Contributor via Getty Images)How it worksThe strategy takes advantage of state laws that allow for the transfer of liabilities through a so-called divisive merger, which is a way to separate a company's operations into discreet business entities.Texas was the first state to allow this, in 2006, which helps explain why the strategy came to be known as the ""Texas two-step.""The first step is the division. The second is that the liability-retaining entity gets limited funding from its solvent parent, files for bankruptcy, and then manages mass tort litigation with the limited funds.The benefits are that further litigation is paused, capping costs, and the assets of the solvent company are walled off from the reach of plaintiffs. The hope is that the solvent parent can also absolve itself of secondary liability for the claims.Story continuesCritics of the strategy see it as a subversion of the US Bankruptcy Code. Whether a solvent company can successfully use this strategy to protect its assets, Markell said, often centers on a key unresolved question still being debated by the courts.That question, according to Markell: ""Who is the debtor?""'Fatally premature'J&amp;J has thus far not been able to prove to judges that the subsidiary it tailor-made for bankruptcy was in fact the true debtor. The company said it would appeal the most recent ruling.3M has run into similar resistance in a maneuver that somewhat resembles what J&amp;J did.It is trying to use the bankruptcy of a group of already established subsidiaries that share the name ""Aearo"" to settle more than 255,000 cases filed by military service members and civilians who say Aearo-made earplugs were faulty and caused their hearing loss.The 3M cases represent one of the biggest examples of multidistrict litigation in history.In June, a US bankruptcy judge in Indiana ruled that the 3M subsidiaries were not in immediate jeopardy, calling the bankruptcy filings ""fatally premature."" The court found they lacked the hallmarks of a bankrupt debtor, echoing the determination made in the J&amp;J case.3M is appealing that ruling to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which has yet to say if it will limit bankruptcy as the Third Circuit Court of Appeals did in J&amp;J’s case.In a statement to Yahoo Finance, a spokesperson for 3M said ""the Aearo proceeding is in a different court than LTL and did not involve the same type of transaction.""3M's headquarters in Maplewood, Minn. (Jim Mone/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Paper-making giant Georgia-Pacific has had more success thus far with this strategy after creating a new affiliate called Bestwall LLC to resolve asbestos-related lawsuits against the main company.A three-judge panel for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals blessed the maneuver in June.One judge dissented, calling the company's restructuring ""little more than a corporate shell game"" that allowed it to ""[obtain] shelter from its substantial asbestos liabilities without ever having to file for bankruptcy.""Plaintiffs are asking the appellate court to reconsider the ruling.""Bankruptcy offers an equitable and practical approach to resolve the complex legal challenges faced by Bestwall LLC,"" the American Tort Reform Association said in a statement concerning the plaintiffs' dispute.The Georgia-Pacific Center in Atlanta.

220,9e14adcd-da7e-31bb-b5f0-df1626262d0f,MDT,2023-08-03,Best Long-Term Investment Stocks to Buy,Kiplinger,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-long-term-investment-stocks-172831591.html,1690997311,STORY,"['CVX', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'MCD', 'MDT', 'SCHW']","[Some of the best long-term investment stocks include companies that are in good financial standing, have a low valuation and pay consistent dividends.Folks seeking out the best long-term investment stocks to buy have a few ways to approach the task. One is to follow the advice of Ben Graham, the father of value investing, using his classic book, The Intelligent Investor.Graham suggests that a defensive investor should buy stocks of large, conservatively financed companies with good earnings power. The companies should also be some of the best dividend stocks, with consistent histories of payouts, and have low valuations.However, in today's world, many tech stocks don't pay dividends. Instead, they often return capital to shareholders through large stock buybacks.Therefore, applying Graham's criteria today, the idea is to find the best stocks to buy that return large amounts of capital to shareholders either through dividends and/or stock buybacks.This allows a company to increase its earnings and dividends on a per-share basis. Moreover, the remaining shareholder's stakes rise over time. Both of these factors can push the stock higher.Another Graham criteria is to find stocks with a low valuation. The S&amp;P 500 has a relatively high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31.4 times over the last 10 years. This article will focus on stocks with price-to-earnings ratios that are lower than the broad market.Lastly, we will stick with stocks that have market caps of $100 billion or higher. They must also have low debt ratios and enough cash flow to reduce their debt, as well as pay dividends and/or buybacks.With this in mind, here are the nine of the best long-term investment stocks to buy now. What Is a Stock Buyback?Data is as of Aug. 1. Dividend yields are calculated by annualizing the most recent payout and dividing by the share price.Market value: $3.08 trillionDividend yield: 0.5%Apple (AAPL, $195.60) is the $3 trillion maker of iPhone smartphones, Mac computers, iPads and numerous other products and services.Story continuesiPhones still represent over half of the company's sales, but recently services, which includes the App Store, have started to increase as well. For example, in its latest quarter ending April 1, Apple's services revenue came in at $20.9 billion, or 22% of its $94.8 billion in sales. That is up from 20% a year ago and 18.9% two years ago.So, this massive tech products company is slowly shedding its overreliance on the iPhone, whose models are all very highly priced. While this will take time, the market so far approves of this plan.And why not? The company is generating massive amounts of free cash flow (FCF), which is the money left over after a company covers expenses to run, maintain and expand the business. Last quarter, Apple said it generated strong operating cash flow of $28.6 billion, while returning over $23 billion to shareholders.Apple pays a small dividend, which it recently raised by 4% to 96 cents annually. That gives the stock a low 0.5% dividend yield. However, this cost the company just $3.7 billion, or 13% of its operating flow.The rest of the $23 billion ""returned"" to shareholders was through stock buybacks. In fact, Apple raised the amount it says it will spend this year on share repurchases to $90 billion. That represents over 3.3% of its total market value.This will benefit long-term shareholders in Apple stock. First, it will raise AAPL's earnings per share over time through having a lower number of shares outstanding for the income it produces.But in addition, the dividend per share can rise faster than it would otherwise since the dividend payments will be spread over fewer number of shares outstanding. And a third effect will be the soaking up of shares traded in the market – effectively acting as a buying source in the market, pushing the blue chip stock higher.Keep in mind that APPL stock is not overly cheap at the moment, at 28.7 times forward earnings – above its five-year average of 23.7, according to Morningstar. However, it is about below the S&amp;P 500's average, as mentioned earlier.Nevertheless, Apple remains one of the best long-term investment stocks due to its consistent and powerful cash flow, dividends and buybacks.Best Dividend ETFs to Buy NowMarket value: $2.50 trillionDividend yield: 0.8%Microsoft (MSFT, $336.34) operates in every key software arena: operating systems, cloud, gaming, application software, and even artificial intelligence (AI) with its new Bing chatbot.MSFT meets all the necessary qualities for being one of the best long-term investment stocks as it has consistent earnings, is conservatively financed and generates large amounts of free cash flow. Moreover, it pays a dividend and spends most of its FCF on share buybacks.Just like Apple, however, MSFT stock is not necessarily cheap on a relative or even historical basis. For example, Microsoft is trading at 30.4 times forward earnings, which is above its five-year average of 28.6. Still, it's below the S&amp;P 500's long-term average.And long-term investors are likely to do quite well with MSFT. The reasons are quite simple: The company's massive cash flow, its products ubiquity and acceptance, and its shareholder rewards are all working in the stock's favor.For example, Microsoft recently reported a 21% year-over-year increase in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share, while revenue was up 8%. Plus, free cash flow was up 12% from the year prior.But more importantly, the company has plenty of room to increase its shareholder-friendly initiatives over time. This is because it spends just about half its free cash flow on dividends and buybacks. It plows the rest back into the company, reducing debt and making investments and acquisitions.So, in the long run, Microsoft shareholders can expect the company to typically grow profits and cash flow, while consistently hiking its dividends and buybacks. In fact, Microsoft has had 18 consecutive years of raising its dividend. That alone, not counting its buybacks and earnings power, makes the Dow Jones stock worthy of holding as a long-term investment.How to Invest in AIMarket value: $303.4 billionDividend yield: 3.7%Chevron (CVX, $162.30) is an integrated energy and chemicals company with both upstream and downstream operations in the U.S. and around the world.CVX meets the criteria for a good long-term investment as it is conservatively financed, produces good profits and pays an attractive dividend it can afford. Moreover, CVX stock is not expensive and the company is actively buying back shares, helping to push it higher.For example, analysts expect Chevron to make $11.94 per share in fiscal 2023, which has the energy stock trading at 13.6 times forward earnings. This is well below the five-year average of 37.9 times.Moreover, Chevron has 36 years of annual dividend hikes under its belt. This is because despite vicissitudes in the prices of oil and gas and chemical industry cycles, the company has consistently produced large amounts of free cash flow.For example, in Q2, Chevron generated $9.4 billion in operating cash flow before working capital changes, and $2.5 billion in free cash flow. The company spent $2.8 billion on dividends and $4.4 billion on share buybacks, for a record $7.2 billion in total shareholder returns.This shows how Chevron manages a fair balance between investing in the future, as well as rewarding its own shareholders now with its cash flow. And it underscores why CVX is the kind of stock that long-term investors want to have in their portfolio.Stocks With the Highest Dividend Yields in the S&amp;P 500Market value: $116.7 billionDividend yield: 3.2%Medtronic (MDT, $87.68) is a $117 billion medical device and therapies company that originally invented the pacemaker. That is probably relatable to people who are looking for the best retirement stocks. Moreover, the company is extremely profitable, which allows it to pay generous dividends and do large share buybacks.Right now, MDT stock has a 3.2% dividend yield. And this yield will likely continue to rise, given the company has reliably raised its dividend for 46 straight years – including a 1.5% hike in May.Moreover, in fiscal 2023, which ended on April 28, Medtronic bought back $645 million of its shares. That works out to be about 55% of one percent of its $117 billion market cap.That is not much, but every little bit helps towards allowing the company to keep raising its dividend.In addition, at just 17.1 times forward earnings, the stock is inexpensive. What's more, this is well below MDT's five-year average of 19.1 times, according to Morningstar.Meanwhile, Medtronic has about $17 billion in net debt on its balance sheet. This is well below its $52 billion in shareholders' equity. Its cash flow should continue to recover from supply chain issues we've seen in the past few years. That will allow Medtronic to reduce its debt reliance over time.And given its powerful cash flow and shareholder returns, MDT is one of the best long-term investment stocks.Bull Markets vs Bear Markets: The Differences ExplainedMarket value: $119.6 billionDividend yield: 1.5%Charles Schwab (SCHW, $65.72) is a well-known discount brokerage firm and investment banking company with which many baby boomers are familiar.SCHW meets all the best criteria for a long-term investment value strategy. For example, it is conservatively financed, pays a consistent dividend with a 1.5% yield, and has a low valuation.As for that dividend, Schwab has had 34 years of consistently paying its dividend each year. That is well over the 10-year average of the median in its sector.Moreover, Schwab recently reported that its return on equity was 20% in the six months ended June 30, up from 15% in the year-ago period. This indicates a substantial rebound in its earnings power. It also allays concerns that the bank might have been hurt by investors worried about a potential recession.Meanwhile, the financial stock is trading at 17.2 times forward earnings, well below its five-year average of 18.6.While the company did recently decide to pause its share buyback program in light of uncertainty in the financial sector following the spring banking crisis. This is likely to reverse once the Federal Reserve stops pushing interest rates higher, which could act as a major catalyst.Investing Jargon, ExplainedMarket value: $212.5 billionDividend yield: 2.1%McDonald's (MCD, $291.07) is a company that just about every investor knows well, especially if they have children. But few realize that it is actually quite a good long-term investment stock to buy as well.The main reason is that the company generates large amounts of free cash flow. For example, in the last 12 months (LTM) ending March 31, MCD produced $5.7 billion in FCF. That represents 2.7% of its $212 billion market capitalization.MCD uses its free cash flow to pay a very ample dividend, which now yields 2.1%. In addition, it bought back almost $3 billion of its shares over the last year.While some folks might not like MCD's quick service restaurant food, plenty of others do. They love its menu, buy McDonald's fries and hamburgers and generally can't get enough of its food.Moreover, it is conservatively financed as its $37 billion in long-term debt, $33.3 billion after cash, is well-managed by the company's ongoing FCF generation.In addition, shareholders have benefited by its history of annually raising its dividend over the last 46 years.Along with its buybacks, MCD stock is attractively valued. For example, it trades for just 26.8 times earnings. While certainly not cheap, this is below its five-year averageThe bottom line – everyone is ""lovin"" MCD stock for the long term.Stock Picks That Billionaires LoveMarket value: $368.3 billionDividend yield: 2.4%Procter &amp; Gamble (PG, $156.25) is a nearly $370 billion consumer products giant with many iconic brand names – including Downy detergent, Mr. Clean cleaning supplies and Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo – that produce large amounts of cash flow for the company.Most everyone knows Procter &amp; Gamble's brands and are familiar with their solid reputations. But few realize how incredibly profitable the company actually is and why PG is one of the best long-term investment stocks to buy.For example, in the last 12 months ended June 30, PG generated $15.2 billion in operating cash and after $3.0 billion in capex spending, $12.2 billion in free cash flow.The FCF represents a massive 15% of P&amp;G's $81 billion LTM sales, which is a very high free cash flow margin for a consumer products company. In fact, some software companies don't even make those kinds of margins.Moreover, this FCF also funds massive dividends and buybacks for shareholders. The company has raised its dividend annually for the last 66 years. Moreover, in its recent earnings call, Procter and Gamble management said it expects to buy back $5 billion to $6 billion in common stock this fiscal year. That represents about 1.5% of its market capitalization.Nevertheless, PG is not expensive relative to its historical valuation. It trades for just 26.5 times earnings, which is well below its five-year average of 35.0.In other words, Procter &amp; Gamble is reasonably priced, generates large amounts of cash flow from its brands and is working diligently to return value to shareholders. That makes it one of the best long-term investments value buyers can make.Best Defensive ETFs to Protect Your PortfolioMarket value: $61.0 billionDividend yield: 5.4%3M (MMM, $110.56) is a $61 billion industrial conglomerate that operates in four sectors: safety and industrial; transportation and electronics; healthcare; and consumer. The company's mission is to apply science to improve people's lives daily.But MMM is also one of the best long-term investment stocks for folks to own. For example, 3M generated $1.5 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter, and returned $800 million to shareholders via dividends.On top of that, 3M buys back its common stock, with the company repurchasing $1.4 billion of its own shares in 2022.Given its free cash flow, investors can take comfort in knowing that MMM's $6.00 annual dividend, which yields an attractive 5.4%, is probably secure.Plus, 3M stock is cheap, trading at just 11.6 times forward earnings, well below its five-year average of 16.6.Moreover, 3M is conservatively financed. The company reported $11.7 billion in net debt at the end of Q2, which was down 12% on a year-over-year basis.Given its strong cash flow, dividends, buybacks, low valuation and financing, the industrial stock looks like a good long-term investment for value buyers.Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying and SellingMarket value: $267.1 billionDividend yield: 3.0%Coca-Cola (KO, $61.77) is an iconic beverage company that generates large amounts of cash flow for its shareholders with its well-known brands such as Coke, Diet Coke, Fanta, Powerade and Minute Maid.That makes it one of the best long term investments a value buyer can make – just ask Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) holding company is KO's top shareholder. What makes KO so attractive is that it is one of the best dividend stocks on Wall Street, having increased its payouts consistently for the last 60 years straight. Most recently, Coca-Cola in February hiked its dividend by nearly 5%.Today, KO stock yields an attractive 3%, and investors can expect the dividend rate to keep increasing.On top of that, Coca-Cola has a strong common stock buyback program. For example, in the last 12 months ended June 30, it spent $872 million on share repurchases. That represents 33% of 1.0% of its $267 billion market value.KO's dividends and share buybacks are more than covered by $9.5 billion in FCF that management expects to generate during 2023.On top of that, the consumer staples stock is trading at 25.6 times earnings, well below its five-year average of 32.1.So, for the long term-investor, KO stock looks like a good investment, given its strong cash flows and shareholder-friendly initiatives.]"

The water would then be returned to the lake with no impact to the local ecosystem while simultaneously reducing CO2 emissions.The science behind the concept was simple, but planning and executing the complex initiative would take more than 14 years. Watch this video to learn more about how it happened.""We studied this project with one ambition, that the cost of this investment must not exceed the cost of using fossil fuels over the next few years,"" said Monory. ""I underestimated the complexity of dealing with various state entities. Fortunately, I was surrounded by some talented people who helped make this very cool idea a reality.""A small team at Medtronic worked with local contractors and government agencies to come up with a plan that everyone could agree on. In the Summer of 2020, during the global pandemic, crews began the three-year process of bringing ENERLAC to life without disrupting operations at the Medtronic facility.By eliminating dependence on fossil fuels, ENERLAC reduced and stabilized energy costs at the site for the next 30 years while also drastically decreasing CO2 emissions by more than 80% - from 820 tons per year to approximately 150 tons per year. The project is an important step in helping Medtronic reach carbon neutrality in its operations by FY30 and achieving a net zero emissions target across the business by FY45.Story continuesIn Tolochenaz, community leaders praised Medtronic and heralded the innovative project as an important part of the area's ecological transition.""Today with hindsight we can say this project was the right thing to do, but 10 years ago there weren't many people who thought like that,"" said Dr. Stéphane Genoud, Head of Energy Management at HES-SO Valais-Wallis University in Switzerland. ""To have a company that decides over ten years to carry out a project like this means they really have a long term vision, and that's quite original.""Learn more about how Medtronic is minimizing our environmental footprint.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Medtronic on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: MedtronicWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/medtronicEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: MedtronicView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/771785/Medtronic-How-Lake-Geneva-Helps-Heat-and-Cool-a-European-Manufacturing-Site]"

The vaccine was previously approved for use in individuals 18 years of age and older. ERVEBO does not protect against other species of Ebolavirus or Marburgvirus and the duration of protection conferred by ERVEBO is unknown. The effectiveness of the vaccine when administered concurrently with antiviral medication, immune globulin (IG), and/or blood or plasma transfusions is unknown. ERVEBO includes a contraindication for individuals with a history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine, including rice protein.""Ebola virus disease is contagious and potentially deadly in both children and adults. We’re proud of the approval of ERVEBO for the prevention of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus in children as young as 12 months old, which is another milestone in our continued commitment to help address the global health threat caused by Zaire ebolavirus,"" said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories.Separately, on July 20, 2023, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended the expanded approval of ERVEBO® [Ebola Zaire Vaccine, (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP) live], for active immunization of individuals 1 year of age or older to protect against Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) caused by Zaire ebolavirus. ERVEBO is currently authorized for use in the European Union (EU) for individuals 18 years of age and older. The CHMP opinion will now be considered by the European Commission for amending the marketing authorization, and a final decision is expected in the third quarter of 2023.Story continuesIn January 2021, Merck confirmed an agreement with UNICEF to establish the world’s first global Ebola vaccine stockpile with ERVEBO to support future Zaire ebolavirus outbreak preparedness and response efforts. As of March 2023, over 500,000 doses of the licensed vaccine have been delivered to the stockpile, which is administered by the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision.Selected Safety Information for ERVEBOCONTRAINDICATIONSDo not administer ERVEBO to individuals with a history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine, including rice protein.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSManagement of Acute Allergic ReactionsAmong 18,616 participants vaccinated with at least one dose of ERVEBO in clinical trials, there were two reports of anaphylaxis. Monitor individuals for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions following vaccination with ERVEBO. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of ERVEBO.Limitations of Vaccine EffectivenessVaccination with ERVEBO may not protect all individuals. Vaccinated individuals should continue to adhere to infection control practices to prevent Zaire ebolavirus infection and transmission.Immunocompromised IndividualsThe safety and effectiveness of ERVEBO have not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals. The effectiveness of ERVEBO in immunocompromised individuals may be diminished. The risk of vaccination with ERVEBO, a live virus vaccine, in immunocompromised individuals should be weighed against the risk of disease due to Zaire ebolavirus.TransmissionVaccine virus RNA has been detected by RT-PCR in blood, saliva, urine, and fluid from skin vesicles of vaccinated individuals. Transmission of vaccine virus is a theoretical possibility.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most commonly reported local and systemic adverse events in clinical trials were:Individuals 18 years of age and older: injection‑site pain (70%); headache (55%); feverishness (39%); muscle pain (33%); somnolence, reduced activity, fatigue (26%); joint pain, arthralgia (19%); chills (17%); injection-site swelling (17%); decreased appetite (15%); abdominal pain (13%); injection-site redness (12%); nausea (10%); arthritis (5%); vomiting (4%), rash (4%); abnormal sweating (3%) and mouth ulceration (2%).Individuals 12 months through 2 years of age: feverishness (83%); crying (31%); decreased appetite (27%); injection-site pain (26%); somnolence, reduced activity, fatigue (20%); diarrhea (19%); vomiting (17%); irritability (11%); screaming (10%); mouth ulceration (6%); chills (5%); injection-site swelling (5%); headache (4%); abdominal pain (2%); abnormal sweating (2%) and injection-site erythema (1%).Individuals 3 years through 11 years of age: feverishness (65%); headache (50%); injection-site pain (40%); decreased appetite (24%); somnolence, reduced activity, fatigue (22%); abdominal pain (21%); chills (14%); myalgia (12%); vomiting (11%); dizziness (8%); nausea (8%); injection-site pruritus (7%); crying (3%); arthralgia (3%); diarrhea (3%); injection-site swelling (3%); abnormal sweating (1%); mouth ulceration (2%) and irritability (1%).Individuals 12 years through 17 years of age: headache (59%); injection-site pain (52%); feverishness (48%); myalgia (30%); somnolence, reduced activity, fatigue (28%); decreased appetite (21%); chills (19%); dizziness (17%); abdominal pain (16%); arthralgia (16%); nausea (8%); abnormal sweating (5%); diarrhea (4%); vomiting (4%); injection-site pruritus (3%); injection-site swelling (3%) and mouth ulceration (2%).DRUG INTERACTIONSInterference with Laboratory TestsFollowing vaccination with ERVEBO, individuals may test positive for anti-Ebola glycoprotein (GP) antibody and/or Ebola GP nucleic acid or antigens. GP-based testing may have limited diagnostic value during the period of vaccine viremia, in the presence of vaccine-derived Ebola GP, and following antibody response to the vaccine.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ERVEBO in pregnant women, and human data available from clinical trials with ERVEBO are insufficient to establish the presence or absence of vaccine-associated risk during pregnancy.Human data are not available to assess the impact of ERVEBO on milk production, its presence in breast milk, or its effects on the breastfed child.INDICATIONS AND USAGEERVEBO® is indicated for the prevention of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus in individuals 12 months of age and older.Limitations Of UseThe duration of protection conferred by ERVEBO is unknown. ERVEBO does not protect against other species of Ebolavirus or Marburgvirus. Effectiveness of the vaccine when administered concurrently with antiviral medication, immune globulin (IG), and/or blood or plasma transfusions is unknown.About Ebola Virus DiseaseEbola virus disease is a rapidly progressive, severe, potentially fatal and transmissible hemorrhagic illness caused by infection with one of the Ebola virus species. While there are six identified Ebola virus species, the Zaire ebolavirus strain has been the leading cause of outbreaks over the last 20 years. The average fatality rate for Ebola virus disease is approximately 50% but has ranged from 25% to 90% in previous outbreaks.Human-to-human transmission can occur via blood or bodily fluids, objects (like needles and syringes), possibly from contact with semen from a man who has recovered from Ebola, or direct contact through broken skin or mucous membranes.About ERVEBO® (Ebola Zaire Vaccine, Live) Suspension for intramuscular injectionERVEBO® is indicated for the prevention of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus in individuals 12 months of age and older. ERVEBO is a live recombinant viral vaccine consisting of a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) backbone deleted for the VSV envelope glycoprotein and substituted with the envelope glycoprotein of the Zaire ebolavirus (Kikwit 1995 strain).ERVEBO was initially engineered by scientists from the Public Health Agency of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory and the technology was subsequently licensed by a subsidiary of NewLink Genetics Corporation now known as Lumos Pharma, Inc. Merck licensed the vaccine in 2014 and led research and development efforts in collaboration with a number of public health organizations to enable a broad clinical development program. This project has been funded in part with federal funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), under contract number HHSO100201700012C.The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), L’institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM), and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) sponsored the PREVAC study, designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two Ebola virus disease vaccine candidates, including ERVEBO, in adults and children aged 12 months and older.ERVEBO is approved in the European Union, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Switzerland, and 10 countries in Africa.About MerckAt Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

Thank you for joining our second quarter 2023 earnings call. Mosaic delivered revenues of $3.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $744 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.04. First, I'd like to discuss the broader agricultural market. Where fundamentals remain constructive, global demand for crops is very strong and supply is struggling to keep up. Geopolitical events are having a major impact. The war in Ukraine continues to restrict supply from one of the world's most important agricultural regions.Last month, the UN Black Sea Grain Initiative collapsed and was followed by the bombing of several grain terminals. As a result, we expect Ukrainian exports of corn and wheat to be down by as much as 30% versus last year, which was in itself a down year.But conflict is only 1 part of the supply problem. Around the world, weather extremes are having a profound effect on crop production. North American yields this year could be negatively impacted by dry conditions and El Nino is hurting production across Southeast Asia and Australia.This situation is exacerbated by underapplication of nutrients, especially potash, which is crucial for drought resistance and crop resilience. To maximize yields and meet global consumption needs, growers need to increase cropping intensity, which will mean increasing fertilizer applications.The world can't afford multiple years of underfertilization and crop production shortfalls. Today, China is importing record levels of soybean, wheat and beef. Roughly 5 million tonnes of China's corn imports over the last 12 months were sourced from the Black Sea Grain deal. This is supply that must be replaced by other regions.The shortfall extends beyond China. Countries across Europe, Africa and Asia will need to replace lost Ukrainian supply. In India, the focus remains on food security and affordability. Recently, the government responded by banning the export of non-Basmati white rice to ensure adequate domestic supply.Constrained supply and strong demand will continue to put pressure on global stock use ratios, which are already at multiyear lows. All these dynamics together continue to support a constructive ag market. The strong ag fundamentals should lead to strong fertilizer demand for the next several years, and we're already seeing robust demand in several of our key markets.Since the spring, improved affordability, channel inventory destocking and sustained demand for grain and oilseeds have brought customers back to the market. In North America, a strong spring application season depleted fertilizer inventories, which customers are now looking to replenish. Logistical constraints associated with low water levels on the Mississippi River and limited trucking capacity persist, but favorable grower economics are leading retailers to secure supplies early to avoid any backups. In Brazil, the market is beginning to move as we expected.Like we saw in North America, demand was deferred late into the typical window, but customers have returned to the market. In-country inventories are well below the levels seen earlier this year and growers are trying to secure tonnes ahead of the fast approaching Zafra season. In India, monsoon rains have been strong enough to drive grower demand for fertilizer. Phosphate imports are expected to be strong throughout the rest of the year. Switching to potash supply. Sanctions continue to restrict Belarusian exports. After a surge earlier in the year, rail volumes to China started to level off. We continue to expect Belarusian potash exports to be in the range of 7 million to 8 million tonnes, which is well below their historic 13 million tonnes. In North America, port terminal capacity has been constrained by multiple events. Repairs at Canpotex's Portland terminal are ongoing and should be completed by the end of the year.In Vancouver, a 13-day strike resulted in a temporary curtailment of the Neptune Terminal, but work continues to finalize a new labor deal, and we hope this will be resolved shortly. Canpotex is making use of alternative ports in Canada and in the Southern and Eastern United States to mitigate some, but likely not all of the impact on international shipments.We expect constrained phosphate supply as well. Over the last several years, changes to China's environmental policy led to the permanent closure of 25% of their domestic capacity. China is also focusing on food security by ensuring adequate domestic supply while also meeting rising industrial demand, both of which are expected to limit exports for the foreseeable future.Industrial demand, particularly in China's lithium iron phosphate production, is expected to grow dramatically over the next several years. Last year, LFP production more than doubled to 1.1 million tonnes of finished fertilizer equivalent and production is expected to grow by an additional 500,000 tonnes in 2023.This new market will continue to take phosphate volumes away from fertilizer production. We expect China's exports to be in the range of 7 million to 8 million tonnes this year or roughly 35% below 2021 export levels.Overall, the fertilizer market recovery is playing out as we expected. In a tight market, volumes are moving and prices are following. Phosphate prices have risen over the last month, while potash prices have stabilized and are now beginning to move higher.This sets the stage for a constructive second half of the year and into 2024. We believe our business is well positioned to capitalize on this recovery. Over the last several years, we've invested in our business to maintain our position as a reliable supplier to customers.In addition to the work we've done on our production assets, we've also invested in the infrastructure necessary to deliver that product. A few examples include the overhauling of our rail fleet, revitalizing our in-country distribution facilities and our purchase of the remaining share of golf sulfur services to secure logistics around our sulfur supply. These investments are integral to our results.In potash, sales volumes for the second quarter reflected the benefit of a strong North American spring planting season, while prices reflected the bottoming of the global market. Markets are improving, a trend we expect to continue throughout the second half of 2023. Over the last year, Mosaic has met demand by carefully managing production and inventory.We have built a flexible, low-cost system that's able to capture market opportunities as they become available. Last month, we temporarily restarted our Colonsay mine to replace Esterhazy production, which is currently undergoing its summer turnaround. In the third quarter, we expect total potash sales volumes of 2.1 million to 2.3 million tonnes. This guidance reflects the results of a very successful summer fill program in North America, which was oversubscribed by 30%. We currently expect MOP prices at the mine in the range of $250 to $300 per tonne.In phosphates, we reported strong sales volumes in the second quarter. Our average realized price was at the high end of our guidance range, and our stripping margin benefited from lower raw materials costs. As we discussed last quarter, we are pushing ahead with increased investments in our phosphate business targeted at improving reliability. This may require short-term increases in maintenance like we experienced during the second quarter.Looking ahead to the third quarter, we have a solid order book with 70% committed and priced today. We anticipate total sales to be in the range of 1.7 million to 1.9 million tonnes and DAP prices at the plant in the range of $475 to $525 per tonne.In Brazil, we reported sequential improvements in our operating results. Our distribution margins are recovering, and we expect that trend to continue in the third quarter as Brazil demand moves higher. 90% of our third quarter volume is already committed and priced.Finally, I'd like to spend some time on our capital allocation strategy. Our approach has not changed. We remain committed to investing in our business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. In potash, an independent audit of the K3 mine and K2 mill expansion was recently completed, which verified a total nameplate capacity of 7.8 million tonnes at our Esterhazy potash complex.Esterhazy is now the largest potash operation in the world and certainly one of the most efficient. In addition to the underground optimization, we've also begun debottlenecking the K2 mill at Esterhazy by installing a new hydrofloatation process. This will add up to 400,000 tonnes of incremental production capacity with minimal additional operating costs. We're investing $55 million in this project, which has an unlevered after-tax IRR in excess of 75%. In phosphates, we continue to move production away from commodity products and towards differentiated value-added products through the expansion of MicroEssentials capacity at our Riverview facility. Following the expansion, which is expected to be complete by the end of the year, about half of our North American phosphate sales volumes will be higher value specialty products. This is a $34 million investment with an after-tax unlevered IRR in excess of 50%. This expansion comes just ahead of next year's launch of MicroEssentials Pro, which is the next generation of MicroEssentials. Our field trials in Brazil indicate that growers will see a yield bump on soybean acres of 3% or roughly 2 bushels per acre versus current generation of MicroEssentials.Against traditional MAP solutions, MicroEssentials Pro provides an 8% yield advantage or nearly 5 bushels an acre. The patent on the new formulation extends through 2038. We are very excited about the launch of MicroEssentials Pro, which builds on an already strong foundation of value creation for the growers, our customers and for our shareholders.In addition to higher-grade phosphate fertilizer, we're also exploring entry into purified phosphoric acid for the lithium iron phosphate battery market. Our initial work has validated this opportunity and together with constructive and developing discussions with OEMs and battery manufacturers, our Board of Directors has approved an additional $60 million to commence engineering work on a commercial plant. In our Mosaic Fertilizantes business, we're building a 1 million-tonne blending and distribution facilities in Palmeirante, in the state of Tocantins in Northern Brazil. We currently don't have much presence in this region, so the facility will extend our distribution footprint into an attractive high-growth area.This is an $80 million investment with an after-tax unlevered IRR in excess of 20%. In total, our capital spending expectations this year remains unchanged at $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. Our balance sheet is strong.During the quarter, we entered into a $700 million credit facility, which gives us additional flexibility to manage our capital. Our final focus is on capital return to shareholders. All excess cash will be returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.Year-to-date, we're ahead of our target. Over the last 18 months, we've repurchased 15% of our float and believe our shares still represent good value. Our regular dividend today is $0.80 per share, and our business positions us to consider further increases over time.To sum up, Mosaic continues to demonstrate the earnings power and resilience we have created over the last several years. Our second quarter results were strong despite deferred fertilizer demand in many markets and our outlook for the remainder of the year and beyond is quite positive. The world's farmers have strong incentive to maximize crop production and meet global food demand. Fertilizer is critical to their success, and Mosaic will continue to meet that need.Paul Abdelmassieh MassoudThanks, Joc. Before we open the lines for live Q&amp;A, we'd like to address some of the most common questions that came in last night. Our first question is on our guidance. With fertilizer markets turning higher in the last few weeks, is there conservatism in our outlook? What are we assuming in our volume and price ranges for phosphates and potash?James C. O’RourkeThank you, Paul. In potash, our volume will be dependent on the ability to ship internationally. With the continued labor unrest following the 13-day strike in Vancouver and the ongoing repairs at Portland, our export capability may be limited. But the midpoint of our guidance range is in line with our historic average, which tells you how strong the North American demand has been this summer.Demand has been very strong with our summer fill program oversubscribed by 30%. Phosphate volumes could also see some upside given the strong global demand, but we're limited on inventory. We expect production to be higher sequentially, so there is some opportunity to exceed our current guidance range.On pricing, 70% of our Q3 order book is committed and priced. Depending on how the rest of the quarter plays out, there is an opportunity for price upside. But much of that would get realized in the fourth quarter, where we have more unpriced tonnes.Paul Abdelmassieh MassoudJoc, our next question is on Brazil. Fertilizantes' recovery appears to be slower than some had expected. Were there any major surprises in the second quarter? And how should investors think about that business in the second half of the year?James C. O’RourkeThank you, Paul. Weaker pricing affecting our production business and demand deferral due to grower liquidity issues extended longer into the second quarter than we had been anticipating. But the market did eventually turn.And at today's prices, the (inaudible) ratio for beans is very attractive, which is driving farmers to secure supply for their Zafra season. Our distribution business posted a sequential improvement in quarter 2, and we see that trend continuing into the second half of the year.Second half distribution margins are expected to be at the high end of our targeted range of $30 to $40 per tonne. In production, second quarter results were impacted by unplanned outages at Uberaba and Araxá. Those issues are behind us, so we expect higher volumes in the third quarter. The other issue in our production business was working through higher cost inventories of sulfur and ammonia, which we now expect to be lower in the third quarter. Overall, with high-cost finished product destocking and distribution now complete and Brazilian operational issues behind us, the business is very well set up for Brazil's busiest quarter of the year.Paul Abdelmassieh MassoudJoc, our next question is on Colonsay. What was the rationale for Colonsay's restart? Is market demand now strong enough to keep it running after Esterhazy's turnaround is complete?James C. O’RourkeThank you, Paul. Yes. Colonsay will be needed for the foreseeable future. Over the last year, we have met potash demand by carefully managing production and inventories. In quarter 2, strong demand in North America resulted in approximately 300,000 tonnes of inventory drawdown with Esterhazy's planned summer turnaround and a very successful summer fill program, Colonsay tonnage is required to meet our customer expectations and needs. At present rates, Colonsay must run approximately 5 months to replace the 1-month Esterhazy maintenance turnaround. With strong demand in North America and a rebounding international market, the main determinant to future volumes will only be limited by export logistics capabilities.Paul Abdelmassieh MassoudJoc, the last question that we want to address is on capital allocation. Is Mosaic still committed to returning all free cash flow to shareholders?James C. O’RourkeOur commitment to return all of our free cash flow has not changed. Though to reiterate, that is a commitment to return cash flow over time, not a quarterly commitment. Returns will vary from quarter-to-quarter based on the seasonality of our business and internal capital needs.However, keep in mind, year-to-date, we have returned in excess of 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders.Paul Abdelmassieh MassoudThat concludes the fireside portion of our call. Operator, could you please open the lines for the live Q&amp;A?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Steve Byrne of Bank of America.Stephen V. ByrneJoc, I'd like to hear your view on what you think is an appropriate potash price in the market right now, given, as you highlighted, the reduced production at Belarus, you got tight inventory levels in most of the world, lower nutrient levels in much of the soil and yet you're expecting pricing in the high 200s mine gate. Does that seem appropriate to you? Or is there something that's causing potash pricing to be weaker than maybe we would have thought. Some second tier pricing out there that's coming from perhaps Russia or Belarus, is there some of that, that's causing this?James C. O’RourkeSteve, it's a really good question. And I think you have to start with the after effects of last year where I think in some key markets, there was panic and then overpricing and then the reflection or the shadow of that was a complete walk away from the market by farmers.We talk about a potash holiday or whatever. I think as we move into particularly this third quarter, I would say that we have probably overcorrected significantly to the downside now based on basic facts. The market is not going to be demand limited. The market is definitely going to be supply limited in potash.Our expectations from the former Soviet Union, Belarus, we're expecting it to still be in the range of 7 million, down from -- 7 million to 8 million, down from 13 million. The Russian producers themselves are down as much as 4 million to 5 million tonnes this year.So I definitely think that mine gate prices are probably arguably at least $100 below what they could easily move to in probably the near term. So do I believe the prices are appropriate for where we are today? No. But at the same time, I will reiterate that from a first perspective, the volumes have to move.Those volumes are now moving and they're moving strongly. Brazil is moving strongly as we move into Zafra. Our North American fill program is extremely successful. We're starting to see not only volume move, but price move in China. India still has its problems, but I think that they need product. So I think all of those things lead to a very strong rebound, and I'm hoping it doesn't create too much of a rebound that it can't happen in a more orderly way. So overall, I would say -- the fundamentals point to something that should be quite bullish.OperatorThe next question comes from Joel Jackson of BMO Capital Markets.Joel JacksonOn phosphates, could you talk a little bit about in your release, your comment that says for phosphate in the third quarter, you expect margins will benefit from lower raw material costs in the third quarter. So does that imply that you think third quarter phosphate margins will be up sequentially?And then just in general, phosphate rock costs have been higher for several quarters. Should we expect that to continue? When would phosphate rock costs, maybe, go back down to more normalized ranges? Or is it near normal?James C. O’RourkeOkay. Thanks, Joel. So assuming the phosphate prices hold, clearly, lower raw materials prices will result in a better margin. And we see actually a divergence. We're still seeing the -- at least the sulfur prices has remained low and has gone to even lower.Ammonia, on the other hand, is starting to tighten up a little bit. So we might expect ammonia to be flat or even up a little bit over the rest of the year, depending, obviously, on markets. But overall, we think that raw material costs will help our margins this year or this next 6 months.And what we're seeing is we're seeing price movement. Jenny, do you just want to clarify price movement on phosphates, particularly, I guess, Brazil right now?Yijun WangYes, Joc. Phosphate price changed well, moved up towards since beginning of July. In North America, DAP and MAP price moved up over $50 per tonne and Brazil followed over the last few weeks as well. And we should see the price upward impact not only in Q3, but also into Q4.James C. O’RourkeAnd the second half of your question or the second part of your question was the rock cost in mining. And I guess there's a couple of issues within mining that are relevant. Our new area we're mining in 4 corners. We have run into -- which isn't surprising. As we start a new area, we run into variations in the rock quality and the rock and what we're running into as we mine. And then in South Fort Meade, we are running into -- we're in a new area in the eastern extension of that mine. In both those cases, we -- in the second quarter, we were moving into new areas. So as we get into the new areas, and we're in the main ore bodies, we expect those costs will come down as the grade and the ease of mining increases.OperatorNext question comes from Richard Garchitorena of Wells Fargo.Richard GarchitorenaLooking at the slides, when you look at global shipments, it looks like you took your potash shipments down as well as phosphate assumptions for the year. Just wondering, is that a function of the limitations you're seeing upon the port level, demand, you're talking about strong demand in North America as well as in Brazil. And then just what's driving the reduction on the phosphate side as well?James C. O’RourkeThanks, Richard. In terms of our phosphate volumes, if we look at the first half, they've probably been a little lower than what we might have expected. The markets have been good. The limitation has probably been, in general, starting inventory at the start of the year was low, and then we're running, I would say -- hand to mouth would be the way to say it.So every ton that we make is going straight to market. And that means if you're -- if anything -- any hiccups, you have -- you get delays. So it puts risk on the timing for particularly the end of the year. So on that -- in that case, I think the market is strong. We'll be -- whatever we can produce, we'll be able to sell. In potash is exactly what I said earlier, which is the logistics constraints, particularly for our exports will be the main limitation.OperatorThe next question comes from Christopher Parkinson of Mizuho.Christopher S. ParkinsonJust on the potash rock cost, just given the shift in mine mix, at least temporarily towards Colonsay versus Esterhazy. How should we be thinking about the cash costs during the second half of '23 based on your projected operates?And then any preliminary views once Esterhazy back up and presumably Colonsay stays back online. Just what would be kind of the normalized run rate that we should be considering into 2024?James C. O’RourkeYes. Thanks, Chris. If I think about this from a macro level, if you will, which is probably the easiest, I think the cost at Colonsay -- cash cost at Colonsay. So we'll look at those with the way we're running are probably coming in $30 higher than Esterhazy. So for the 1 month of Esterhazy downtime that we're replacing in the, say, the next 5 months of Colonsay running, that incremental 100,000 tonnes a month will be at a $30 increase in cost.Again, highly profitable still. And again, part of the -- our thinking is always we want to be selling a highly profitable tonnes. So -- but once Esterhazy is up and running, and again, Esterhazy will be up and running probably in a month after we finish the maintenance turnaround. And then we'll be looking at continuing to run Colonsay because we'll need to make up that tonne plus the -- sorry, the tonnes from a month of downtime in the Esterhazy complex plus the 300,000 tonnes that we -- we didn't start up Colonsay until we absolutely had to.And that was the time we absolutely had to. So it will run for a while. And during that time, 100,000 tonnes a month will come out at a $30 higher cost than probably what our average would have been prior to that.OperatorThe next question comes from Edlain Rodriguez of Credit Suisse.Edlain S. RodriguezQuick questions on potash shipments again. You have it at 62 million to 65 million tonnes. Like do you see it going back to that 70 million range over the next year or 2? And part 2 of that same question, part of the reduction was due to fewer tonnes out of Belarus and Russia. Like why can't the other producers ramp up to replace those lost transform Eastern Europe if the issue is not lower demand?James C. O’RourkeYes. Thanks, Edlain. Again, I just want to reiterate, the 62 million to 65 million tonnes is not demand-driven this year. It is supply driven. I'm going to give over to Jenny to just walk through the details. But let me say, the market was low to start at the start of the year.So there were constraints in terms of a slow start to Brazil, a little bit later, China contract or whatever. And so it took some time to get product really moving this year. But as we go through that, like we said earlier, the limitation is going to be logistics. And I think what will allow the other producers to make up the gap is going to depend on if you can actually move it. I would imagine that most of the other producers or most of the other sources other than maybe Canpotex are actually supply limited. And Canpotex is likely going to be logistics limited. But Jenny, do you want to just go through the supply and demand balance?Yijun WangYes, I think you covered well on the supply side of the limitation from Belarus and Russia earlier and also the limitation on the logistics side for the Canadian producers. On the supply side, we are seeing a wide range of recovery in the global market, firstly, laid by the North America market.We are saying North American potash demand are growing back by 20% or more this year versus last year. So this has been proven from a strong spring application and a very strong summer field program. We're seeing the rebounding of the demand in Brazil as well and also similarly to the other Latin American market.How this demand is going to recover this year even greater than our current estimation, which is 64 million tonnes, it is really supply driven. So back to your question when we will see this number -- a shipment number to go back to 70 million tonnes? Probably next year, the supply is unlikely going to go back to 70 million tonnes. We are forecasting in 2025 when the FSU producers' shipment could be recovered back to pre-sanction and that number might be achieved. So once again, the shipment for potash at a global level is really constrained by supply.James C. O’RourkeYes. Just to reiterate, and I think this also answers part of where Steve Byrne was coming from earlier. Until there's a resolution of the Ukraine war and until there's a resolution of the Belarus sanctions, this is going to be a supply-constrained market. And I don't think any of us can really say when either of those issues are going to get resolved.OperatorThe next question comes from Andrew Wong of RBC Capital Markets.Andrew D. WongJust a question on Esterhazy capacity figure. What does that mean for your normal operating capacity? Does that mean if the mine just can produce a lot more than what it was doing previously? And what does that mean for the Canpotex allocation?James C. O’RourkeThanks, Andrew. Well, first of all, let me say the way that the nameplate capacity, if you will, is determined, is an independent audit with a short run to demonstrate that the unit operations are capable of the design. So that is complete.We are now working with Canpotex to figure out what that means from an allocation perspective. And we'll update you on that when that is complete. In terms of the actual operating rate, you have to remember that, that is the -- I'm going to call it a peak capacity.There would be a -- probably a further -- you're not going to run that every day and then you're going to have your yearly downtimes and stuff like that. So it's a theoretical number. We'll run Esterhazy probably reasonably hard, but I wouldn't expect it to run at those rates. I would down rate it from that. Although once we put the new hydrofloat process in place, it may well run over 7 million tonnes.OperatorThe next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.Vincent Stephen AndrewsJust a quick clarifying question would be, one, Joc, did you say that Colonsay you anticipate just sort of running for -- until you make up for the -- what you're losing, having Esterhazy down, then you intend to probably turn it back off? Or is your intention to keep it running perpetually? And then my real question is whether you could talk about the MicroEssentials Pro product a little bit more and just help us understand how you're going to price it versus that incremental yield value you talked about? And then over what period of time do you think MicroEssentials 2 replaces MicroEssentials 1 and how we should be thinking about all that?James C. O’RourkeYes. Thanks, Vincent. Yes, let me start with Colonsay. For now, Colonsay needs to run to reestablish our inventory levels to where they would have been previous to the Esterhazy shutdown. As you're well aware, these operations shut down pretty much every summer in Canada. So we've managed our inventory such that we don't have a bunch of excess coming into the summer.And so now we'll run Colonsay first to fill that, then to make up the gap of what we had in extra we had in Q2 and what we're seeing for the summer fill in Q3. So I would say for the foreseeable future, we could see Colonsay running.But again, I'm not going to run an operation for the sake of running it. We're going to manage our inventories, managing our working capital carefully, and part of that means using the production capacity at Colonsay to manage that function.In terms of MicroEssentials Pro, and as I said earlier, this is a pretty exciting piece of progress. First of all, the very fact that it takes the patent level out to 2038 gives us a nice protection for a long time. But equally exciting is it appears that what we're seeing is real agronomic benefit.And we don't have a pricing strategy or an implementation strategy, a launch strategy quite finished out yet. But I will say our philosophy has always been that we would share the benefit from the new products basically equally between the grower, i.e., the farmer, the retailer who is selling it and ourselves.So our pricing strategy will be such that we can do that. And again, the economics should be fairly strong because the gain is fairly strong as it was for MicroEssentials.OperatorNext question comes from Josh Spector of UBS.Joshua David SpectorSo I just wanted to ask it within potash, when you're talking about making up most of the disruption within the logistics in Canada to get material out. I assume that's going to have a higher shipment cost. So one, I'm wondering, can you quantify roughly how you're thinking about what that could be?And two, is that a cost that you would have to eat? Or is it something that you can get potentially buyers to kind of back in on? I assume it's going to impact your cost structure, but I want to clarify that.James C. O’RourkeYes, Josh, thank you. We are using both New Brunswick and Thunder Bay and looking at even some Southern U.S. Gulf to move the product. And obviously, those come with higher prices. I can't give you the exact, as we would, those flow through Canpotex, which is a marketing organization that we use. And it doesn't -- what we talk about when we talk about our mine site return incorporates those extra logistics costs. So it's very much dependent on which country or which market these are going to, it depends on whether it flows through, like I say, New Brunswick. But yes, you can assume there will be some extra costs whether the buyer will absorb those costs or ours is really a supply and demand issue rather than a -- we don't price per se, we follow a global market, and we have to take what the global market gives us. So in a sense, we're a price taker. So if the market is tight and supply and demand drives price up, we'll absorb -- those will absorb the expenses. If the supply and demand is not, then probably it will come to the suppliers. But we think the market is tight. So we think that, that probably gets absorbed by the end user.OperatorThe next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.Adam L. SamuelsonYes. I was hoping to maybe dig in a little bit more on Brazil and Fertilizantes and maybe just try to calibrate on the production side. Certainly, you gave some -- a clear view on the distribution business. But as I think about profitability improvement in the second half on production, can you just help maybe dimensionalize the benefits that come from the lower inputs that you've been buying that can finally flow through the P&amp;L size, maybe the conversion cost improvement or rock cost improvement that comes from operations running more efficiently?And is there anything to think about from a product mix perspective, if competition on TSP and SSP has maybe been more kind of intense than MAP that might be influencing your realized price and sales mix?James C. O’RourkeYes, there's a lot to digest in that one. I might just throw it to Jenny and ask her to talk a little bit about raw materials pricing and some pricing strategies and what we see with competition, particularly on the different grades in Brazil.Yijun WangYes. So you're right that in Brazil, we sell our phosphate product. We do have the competitions on TSP and SSP and similarly to MAP. Over the last few weeks, we are seeing the price rebound across the whole portfolio of phosphate. So therefore, the price increases that which is much more visible for MAP, that is actually the same for TSP and SSP. So we are going to see a higher price for all range of the phosphate products that we're going to sell in Q3. On raw material prices, similarly to the raw material prices lagging in terms of the reflection in our margin, the lower-priced sulfur and lower-priced ammonia is going to take time to really be reflected in Q3.We will see a lower cost of sulfur and ammonia. But in comparison with the market benchmark, probably the speed of that comparison probably going to be a little bit lagging.James C. O’RourkeYes. Thanks, Jenny.OperatorThe next question comes from Aron Ceccarelli of Berenberg.Aron CeccarelliI have 1 on potash imports in Brazil. First half industry figures suggest that inputs in Brazil were down 10% year-over-year after being down in '22 around 10% again. So this would -- if this trend continues would put Brazil potash imports at around 10 million tonnes, which should be a reasonably low level. So maybe can you comment on the behavior now you see from farmers in Brazil and how you see demand picking up over there, please?James C. O’RourkeThanks, Aron. Yes, in fact, Brazil imports have been lower this year. And we -- and last year for that matter. If you look overall, there was a buildup of inventory in Brazil because actual application last year was -- particularly in the second half of the year was quite low as prices probably drove that. But potash imports have been lower. We've actually lowered our expectation for overall Brazil fertilizer use too, I think it's 42 million tonnes now, Jenny. Thank you. 42 million tonnes from what was probably peaked at about 46 million tonnes a couple of years ago. So you are down a good 10% on overall fertilization.The one thing I want to highlight what that means, though, is it doesn't -- I don't think that's indicative of a decreasing market per se because Brazil has had very good harvest and Brazil as a tropical depleted soil needs to fertilize every year.So Brazil double crops. In other words, it takes 2 crops a year off that land every year. So the carryout of fertilizer in the crops is high. And they have to add that fertilizer back every year. They have not been doing that for the last 2 years. That will not continue without having some sort of agronomic impact on yields. Jenny, do you want to just talk about that a little bit of the Brazil market and the balance?Yijun WangYes, I think you covered it well, Joc. I just want to say for potash, overall shipments last year reduced by 10%, you're right. And this year, we are actually saying the shipment -- total shipment in country, it's probably going to be flat, and we do see the potential upside in the rest of the year. So I just want to reiterate, if the potash or other nutrients are under applied in that kind of a market, you will see the yield impact and the Brazilian farmers, they know that very well, and that has been reflected in the very recent buying activities.OperatorThe next question comes from Jeffrey Zekauskas of JPMorgan.Jeffrey John ZekauskasAs your potash prices have come down, your Canadian resource taxes have also come down? Is there a way to gauge what Canadian resource taxes are going to be over the next couple of quarters or into next year?James C. O’RourkeYes. Thanks, Jeff. I'm looking curiously at my partners here to see if anybody has a good answer to that. That's probably a little more detail than I have off the top of my head. I mean, yes, I'm not -- I don't have a forecast detailed enough to kind of give you an answer to that. We can get back to you probably. That's probably the easiest. But you're right, it definitely does come down as it's been quite significantly down from where the prices were earlier. So -- but I apologize, I can't give you much more than that. Clint, if you got any detail that you could add?Clint C. FreelandYes. I would just say one of the factors in that -- one of the key factors in that is around price. And so I think it's going to track or follow kind of what your price expectations are. I think from a percentage or a margin standpoint, it should remain fairly similar, but again, I think it will follow your price expectations as you go forward.OperatorThe next question is a follow-up from Steve Byrne of Bank of America.Stephen V. ByrneYes. I was just curious about the difference between those 2 versions of MicroEssentials. And was that yield benefit demonstrated by some land grant universities that you can back it up with? And when do you think you might have versions 3 and 4 and so forth that might have some biologics in there for your collaboration with BioConsortia?James C. O’RourkeWell, Steve, I was going to say welcome back. We've missed you. Yes, there's -- so the big thing we're talking about really in the new generation of MicroEssentials is what we're calling a swellable granule, which means the granule is actually able to kind of control the release and increase the release of the key components.And so it's a coding and how we actually make the product. But the key issue there is it's making both the sulfur and the phosphates more bioavailable -- and the micronutrients more bioavailable to the plant at the plant root. So that's kind of the layman's, which is probably as good as I'm going to get for you.But the layman's terms for what this product is designed to do. Now the field trials we're doing, we're working, again, on our own. We normally do field trials with, think, groups like the University of Illinois at their Champaign campus and on our own and with our customers and in Brazil. So we do them over a number of places.Again, as a producer and we can't afford to introduce a product that isn't well proven and doesn't give good results to the grower. So we're pretty conservative on how we do that and how we introduce these new products. But it has been in the works for a few years. And now with the patent in place, we feel comfortable we can start introducing it.It is well trialed and we'll continue. I think there's another season of trials that will go next year, et cetera, et cetera. In terms of the biologics, yes, we've been working on trying to see what biologics might be. I think that's a little further off in the future. It is an exciting new area, again. But we really don't want to stick our neck too far until things are really proven. So watch this space, and I think there will be new stuff in the future.OperatorThe next question is also a follow-up from Edlain Rodriguez of Credit Suisse.Edlain S. RodriguezYes, so just -- I mean, just a follow-up on the potash shipments question again. I mean you've made it clear that the market is supply limited. That's fine. But you want to say for the fact that Colonsay will remain operational for good. Like doesn't the market need that supply?James C. O’RourkeYes. Thanks, Edlain. Yes, for clarification, from an actual supply and demand perspective, I agree with you 100%. All of our production is likely to be required in the market, like I say, at least for the near term, we have to do 2 things. We have to be able to move it out, which right now has been a little bit restricted.If you think there was a 13-day strike in -- at the Vancouver port. So all of these stock workers were off and I think there's a new ratification vote on Friday, but they're right now in labor negotiations. But even as you come out of this, the time it takes to make the system fluid again, will probably be over a month. Our main carrier to the West Coast Canadian Pacific has said it will take at least a month to get that system fluid again.Remember, it's not just potash, it's not just fertilizers, it's -- there's coal, there's grain and everything else that moves through that port and then there's a big intermodal as well. So the pressure on the port and the rail system if it's shut down is pretty substantial and pretty substantial to overall the Canadian economy. But in terms of us, we need that. And if the market comes back and stay strong, no question in my mind. We would love to see Colonsay run for a long, long time.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joc O'Rourke for any closing remarks.James C. O’RourkeWell, thank you, everyone, for your attention. To conclude the call, I just want to reiterate our key messages. Mosaic delivered solid earnings in the second quarter, and we have a positive outlook for the remainder of this year. Agricultural markets are strong. Farmers around the world have strong incentive to maximize crop production. As a result, global fertilizer demand is also robust, and we expect that demand to remain strong.Mosaic today is well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing fertilizer market recovery. The transformation of our cost structure, along with the investments we've made over the past decade are delivering earnings power and cross-cycle resilience. So thank you for joining our call. Have a great and safe day.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.]"

So with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.Blake Moret: Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our third quarter results on Slide 3. We saw good double-digit growth in both sales and earnings this quarter as component shortages continue to ease. Lead times also continued to reduce across our product lines with recovery to pre-pandemic lead times expected for all products by the end of the calendar year. We did miss almost a week of planned shipments in May because of a longer-than-expected changeover to a new third-party logistics supplier at our North American distribution center. Shipments from this distribution center recovered in June and we now have higher capacity in place for Q4 fiscal year 2024 and beyond. Both total and organic sales grew over 13% versus prior year with currency and acquisitions roughly netting each other out.Story continuesCurrency translation decreased sales by less than a point and acquisitions contributed over a point of growth this quarter. Similar to prior quarters, the split of our sales by business segment, region and industry was largely driven by the composition of our backlog. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales were up 8% versus prior year. The changeover in our distribution center had the biggest impact on this segment in the quarter. Within the Intelligent Devices segment, Independent Cart Technology continues to be a disruptive technology, and we had several more strategic material handling wins in the U.S. this quarter. The recent launch of our On-Machine Armor Kinetix motion control products adds to our innovative material handling portfolio.We also had an important win in Europe with SIDEM, one of the world's leading desalination companies where our PowerFlex drives and services expertise are helping this customer deliver economical and sustainable drinking water to millions of people in developing regions. Software &amp; Control organic sales grew over 24% year-over-year. Logix sales were almost 40% this quarter, reflecting the strong differentiation of our control platform and the continued benefits from supply chain resiliency investments we've made over the last year. Another example of our many ways to win within Software &amp; Control is recent success at a well-known global parcel delivery company, where the combination of our awesome industrial PCs ThinManager and View software unseated a long-standing competitor as the customer standardizes its North America facilities on a Rockwell visualization platform.Lifecycle Services organic sales increased 8% versus prior year. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.08, led by strong orders in Sensia and our services business. Sensia had another good quarter of orders and sales with multiple large deals across EMEA and Asia. We also delivered higher sequential margins in Lifecycle Services this quarter. Information Solutions &amp; Connected Services sales grew 10% versus prior year. We had multiple wins across our entire Information Solutions portfolio in Q3 and including both our on-prem and cloud-native software. This quarter, one of the world's top tire manufacturers located in Asia-Pacific, selected Rockwell's FactoryTalk production center to develop its new global MES platform. Another important IS win in Asia was with a Japanese global leader in HVAC where our cloud-native Plex platform is being deployed on Microsoft Azure at one of their greenfield plants.The customer chose our SaaS solution to quickly start up a manufacturing execution and quality management system without the need for extensive on-premise hardware, software and support. We saw Plex synergy wins continue to ramp up in the quarter as our strong market access machine is contributing to new SaaS logos. In the quarter, we saw the benefits of our software partnership with PTC with numerous recurring revenue wins through a combination of our Digital Services business and PTC's ThingWorx visualization platform. Also regarding PTC, we continue to monetize the investment we made in 2018. We now own less than 5% of total shares outstanding and in accordance with the terms of our agreement, I’m stepping off of their Board. Our commercial relationship remains strong and was extended in June.In Connected Services, we had an important cybersecurity win with ADNOC, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. This customer is leveraging our network of security services and expertise along with an intrusion detection system from our partner Dragos to help secure its network infrastructure and comply with cyber governance regulations. Our total annual recurring revenue grew a very strong 17% year-over-year this quarter. Segment margin of 21.1% was flat to last year and in line with our expectations despite the shipment shortfall. Adjusted EPS grew over 13% year-over-year. Backlog is beginning to reduce as lead times improve. Let’s now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q3 end market performance. Our discrete sales were up about 10% versus prior year.Within discrete automotive sales grew mid-teens year-over-year. One of the notable customer wins here this quarter was with the Korean Tier 1 supplier working on an EV battery project for a European brand owner. This customer is using our core automation offerings including motion control to provide tooling for battery thermal management. Another automotive win this quarter was with Jaguar Land Rover where Rockwell was selected to support the JLR electrified architecture for three of their EV body shops in the UK. Semiconductor sales grew high-teens this quarter, building on strength over the last few quarters, we continue to see broader adoption of our wafer transport solutions by the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers. This quarter, we also had an important Plex win in semiconductor at SOC, Saudi Arabia as the customer implements our smart manufacturing platform at its site in Riyadh.In e-commerce and warehouse automation sales were down high-teens versus prior year, driven by continued delays in some cancellations at our e-commerce customers. Moving to our hybrid industry segment. Sales in this segment grew 15% year-over-year led by strong growth in food and beverage and tire. Food and beverage sales were up mid-teens versus prior year. We continue to see both greenfield and brownfield investments in this vertical. With one of our most important multi-year wins this quarter focused on a customer’s global fleet modernization program, a leading global food processing company is standardizing over 50 of its sites on our PlantPAx control platform. This competitive DCS win is a testament to our progress in process control applications in both technology and domain expertise.Life sciences sales grew mid-single digits versus prior year. This industry continues to see strong investments in CapEx and OpEx projects across all regions, both in traditional pharmaceuticals and newer advanced therapy, medicinal products. We had a strategic win with Biosero a member of the BICO Group in North America where our combined technologies increased the speed and accuracy of new drug development. Biosero selected our independent cart technology to automate lab workflows for a cell and gene therapy program. Tire was up over 35% in the quarter. Turning to process industries. Process sales were up 15% year-over-year led by growth in oil and gas and mining. Turning now to Slide 5 in our Q3 organic regional sales. As I said earlier, our growth by region this quarter and for the full year fiscal year 2023 reflects the composition of our backlog rather than the underlying customer demand.North America organic sales grew about 2% year-over-year against higher comps. Latin America was up 7%. Through Q3, our orders in the Americas are outpacing the rest of the world. EMEA sales grew 34% and Asia-Pacific was up over 44%. We did see an uptick in order cancellations in China this quarter. Let’s now move to Slide 6 fiscal 2023 outlook. We are confident that shipments in the fourth quarter will recover the shortfall in Q3 caused by the distribution center change. Shipments in July were in line with our forecast for the full year. Our fiscal 2023 guidance assumes a total reported sales growth range of 14% to 16%, and we continue to expect organic sales growth of 15% at the mid-point. We now expect the impact from acquisitions and currency to offset each other.Nick will cover this in more detail later. We have said all along that we expect further normalization of ordering patterns as lead times and constrained products improve, and that’s what we are seeing right now. With improving lead times, machine builders do not need as many months of products on order and are no longer placing unusually large advanced orders. Their incoming orders and front log remain strong and improving component lead times will help them improve their cash flow. We also expect distributor restock orders will pick up as they receive the last constrained items that allow them to clear their committed inventory and complete customer orders. Our order cancellation rates remain low. We now expect our full year fiscal year 2023 orders to be in the $8.5 billion to $9 billion range.Given this updated order outlook, we now expect to finish the year with about $4.5 billion to $5 billion in backlog with about 80% of that backlog shippable in fiscal year 2024. We expect organic ARR to grow 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase by 160 basis points year-over-year. We are increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 and now expect adjusted EPS to grow 25% versus prior year and we now expect 80% free cash flow conversion due to higher working capital. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q3 performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2023. Nick?10 Highest Paying Countries for Mechanical EngineersRuslans Golenkovs/Shutterstock.comNick Gangestad: Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I’ll start on Slide 8, third quarter key financial information. Third quarter reported sales were up 13.7% over last year. Q3 organic sales were up 13.2% and acquisitions contributed 120 basis points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 70 basis points, about three points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin expanded to 21.1% and was in line with our expectations as improved productivity offset lower than expected sales. The 30 basis point year-over-year increase in margin was driven by higher sales, volume and positive price cost partially offset by higher investment spend. Corporate and other expense was $32 million in line with our expectations.Adjusted EPS of $3.01 was below our expectations due to our shift in shipments from Q3 to Q4. Adjusted EPS grew 13% versus prior year. I’ll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 14.1% and in line with the prior year. Free cash flow of $240 million was $87 million lower than prior year, driven by increases in working capital and income tax payments, partially offset by higher pre-tax income. The increase in working capital was primarily driven by higher accounts receivable and inventory. Inventory grew by six days, primarily in finished goods as a result of the shift in planned shipments from Q3 to Q4. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 220,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $62 million.On June 30, $1 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Organic sales growth was led by software and control, which grew 24% year-over-year. Turning to margins, intelligent devices margin decreased by 290 basis points year-over-year due to higher investment spend, unfavorable mix and higher incentive compensation, partially offset by positive price cost. Segment margin for software and control increased 340 basis points compared to last year on higher sales volume and positive price cost partially offset by higher investment spend. We continue to accelerate top line growth and profitability from acquisitions in the past few years, including Plex, Fiix and ASEM.Lifecycle services margin was similar to last year and improving sequentially through the year as planned. Our focus on productivity is yielding benefits now and into the coming quarters. We continue to expect lifecycle services margin to expand sequentially and exceed 10% in Q4. The next slide, 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal 2022 to Q3 fiscal 2023. Core performance was up $0.90, excluding increased investment spend of $0.35 on a 13.2% organic sales increase. Incentive compensation was a $0.20 headwind. This year-over-year increase reflects the higher expected bonus payout this year versus a below normal payout last year. The year-over-year impacts from tax, interest expense, currency and share count were each immaterial to EPS this quarter.Before we turn to our fiscal 2023 guidance, let’s spend a few minutes talking about our orders trends on Slide 11. We think it will be helpful to provide more color on our orders progression over the last couple years and going forward. First, in fiscal 2020, we saw reduced orders caused by the constraints on customers operations and uncertainty that the pandemic created. Then in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, we saw increased orders driven by the combination of three things. First, historically high levels of investment in certain verticals like EV and semi, as well as an increasing need for more automation to address workforce shortages and business resiliency. Second, catch up on projects that many of our customers deferred during fiscal year 2020.And three, large advance orders due to extended lead times caused by component shortages. In fiscal year 2023, we are continuing to see strong underlying demand, but we are now seeing the long anticipated moderation in orders driven by our improving lead times for products. As we stated earlier, we expect lead times to continue to normalize in the next two quarters and we expect virtually all of our product lead times to be back at pre-pandemic levels by the end of calendar year 2023. Once our lead times are back at normal levels, we expect customer orders to closely align with the strong underlying demand. I think it’s worth noting that over the fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2023 time period encompassing the ups and downs of the order cycle, we will have grown revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 8% plus a backlog that is more than tripled during that timeframe.Let’s now move to the next Slide 12, guidance for fiscal 2023. We are increasing the midpoint of our reported sales guidance from 14.5% to 15%. We expect organic sales growth in the range of 14% to 16% and we now expect a full year currency headwind of 100 basis points, 50 basis points better than our previous guidance. This updated outlook reflects the weakening of the U.S. dollar in recent weeks. We continue to expect volume to add 10 points of growth and price to add 5 points of growth, and we still expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21.5% unchanged from prior guidance. Our updated guidance still assumes full year core earnings conversion of close to 40%. We continue to expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17.5%, unchanged from our prior guide.We are narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $11.70 to $12.10. This increases the midpoint of our EPS guidance to $11.90, up $0.05 from prior guidance and up 25% from last year. The $0.05 increase is driven by currency. We now expect full year fiscal 2023 free cash flow conversion of about 80% of adjusted income. This updated guidance reflects the new calendarization of our revenue and our updated projection of inventory days on hand. We do expect our inventory days on hand to drop by the end of the year to 125 days. This will be lower than the approximately 130 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year 2022, but will likely not reduce to the 112 days we originally expected. Our outlook for cash tax payments also increased as we realized capital gains on our sales of PTC shares.Income tax payments tied to these gains are reflected in our free cash flow results. A few additional comments on fiscal 2023 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2023 is still expected to be about $130 million, and we’re still assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.6 million shares. With that, I’ll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&amp;A. Blake?Blake Moret: Thanks, Nick. As we continue to stay close to end users, machine builders and distributors, a few key themes emerge. First, demand remains strong. We’ve mentioned softness in e-commerce and in parts of the Chinese economy, but investment by end users and machinery builders continues across the majority of regions and serve verticals. Second, the global supply chain is improving, but it will take some months to flush the inefficiencies that have built up over the last few years, especially inventory. This is seen at machine builders, distributors and in our own operations. Third, the opportunities for automation to play a strategic role in our customer success have never been higher. Workforce scarcity, American shoring of manufacturing and the premium being placed on business agility are all positive reads for Rockwell.We’re moving fast to meet these needs with new capacity and capabilities. It’s hard to believe, but our Annual Automation Fair and Investor Day are only about three months away, and you should look forward to hearing more about the exciting next leg of our journey. I want to thank all our employees and also our unmatched distributors who have worked so hard to bring us to this point and who collectively make the difference at our customers. Aijana will now begin the Q&amp;A session.Aijana Zellner: We would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Julianne, let’s take our first question.See also 10 Best Sectors To Invest In Long-Term and 10 Oversold NASDAQ Stocks to Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Second quarter 2022 and full-year 2022 capital excludes $933 million for purchase of the Trace Midstream Haynesville gathering assets, which closed April 29, 2022.GAAP MeasuresSecond-quarter 2023 net income increased by $147 million compared to the prior year reflecting the benefit of higher service revenues driven by contributions from recent acquisitions and increased volumes and rates in the Northeast G&amp;P segment, as well as a favorable change of $324 million in net unrealized gains/losses on commodity derivatives. These improvements were partially offset by lower results from our upstream business driven by lower prices, lower commodity marketing margins, and higher operating and administrative expenses, including the impact from recent acquisitions. The tax provision increased primarily due to higher pretax income and the absence of $134 million associated with the release of valuation allowances on deferred income tax assets and federal income tax settlements recorded in the prior year. The second-quarter and year-to-date 2023 periods also reported a loss from discontinued operations associated with an adverse legal ruling involving former refinery operations.For year-to-date 2023, net income increased $694 million compared to the prior year reflecting a favorable change of $774 million in net unrealized gains/losses on commodity derivatives. Other drivers of the year-to-date increase are similar to those described for the quarterly comparison, except that improved commodity marketing margins more than offset lower NGL processing margins for the year-to-date period.Cash flow from operations for the second-quarter and year-to-date 2023 periods increased compared to 2022 primarily due to favorable net changes in working capital. The year-to-date improvement also reflected higher operating results exclusive of non-cash items.Non-GAAP MeasuresSecond-quarter 2023 Adjusted EBITDA increased by $115 million over the prior year, driven by the previously described higher service revenues, partially offset by lower commodity marketing margins, reduced upstream results, and higher operating and administrative expenses. Year-to-date 2023 Adjusted EBITDA increased by $399 million over the prior year, driven by similar factors, except that commodity margins were overall improved.Second-quarter 2023 Adjusted Net Income improved by $31 million over the prior year, driven by the previously described impacts to net income, adjusted primarily to remove the effects of net unrealized gains/losses on commodity derivatives, amortization of certain assets from the Sequent acquisition, and favorable income tax benefits. Year-to-date Adjusted Net Income increased by $216 million over the prior year for similar reasons.Second-quarter 2023 Available Funds From Operations (AFFO) increased by $85 million compared to the prior year primarily due to higher results from continuing operations exclusive of non-cash items.

We also add our proportional ownership share (based on ownership interest) of modified EBITDA of equity-method investments.Adjusted EBITDA further excludes items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations. Such items are excluded from net income to determine adjusted income and adjusted earnings per share. Management believes this measure provides investors meaningful insight into results from ongoing operations.Available funds from operations (AFFO) is defined as cash flow from operations excluding the effect of changes in working capital and certain other changes in noncurrent assets and liabilities, reduced by preferred dividends and net distributions to noncontrolling interests. AFFO may be adjusted to exclude certain items that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations.This news release is accompanied by a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP financial measures. Management uses these financial measures because they are accepted financial indicators used by investors to compare company performance. In addition, management believes that these measures provide investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of assets and the cash that the business is generating.Neither adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income, nor available funds from operations are intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor are they presented as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations.

Welcome to Spirit's Second Quarter Results Call. I'll begin today by discussing the IAM contract and providing an update on the 737 vertical fin attached fitting progress. On the IAM contract, we are very pleased to have in place a 4-year contract with our IAM represented employees, which reflects the gratitude we have for their contributions. While the first vote resulted in a work stoppage, we quickly went back to the table with our union partners and reached a resolution. Due to the work stoppage from the strike, we now expect to deliver between 370 and 390 units, 737 fuselages this year. The front of our production line is starting to break to 42 airplanes per month in August, but we won't be able to fully recover the lost manufacturing days from the work stoppage and the subsequent resumption of full production at our Wichita site. Mark will walk you through some of the financial impacts related to the new contract and work stoppage in his comments. On the vertical Fin attached fittings. First, all the rework on the available 737 fuselages in Wichita was completed during the second quarter, which was ahead of the time line we provided on our last call and within the financial estimates that we provided. We were quickly able to develop a repair process and prioritize the rework. I want to recognize our operations team for the incredible effort they made to develop the repair, implement it and maintain the schedule and budget. With regards to the units at Boeing, we have also recorded a provisional liability in the second quarter related to a potential claim for the repair work performed to date at Boeing. Additionally, we do not expect a material financial impact associated with previously delivered airplanes in the fleet. Now turning to our commercial business. Commercial air traffic demand continues to be strong and is approaching full recovery to pre-COVID levels. Based on May results, global air traffic is at 96% of 2019 levels, with domestic air traffic now exceeding 2019 levels by 5% and international approving to 91% of 2019 levels. This strong recovery in traffic, combined with robust airline demand for new airplanes with improved fuel efficiency and seating capacity has fueled the recent large orders booked from airlines. As a result of these orders, our backlog at Spirit grew from $37 billion to $41 billion in the second quarter, which includes work packages on all commercial platforms in the Airbus and Boeing backlog. We are focused on executing the upcoming rate increases to meet the strong recovery in demand. While we are making progress, there continues to be challenges in the supply chain, which have destabilized our production lines. We still see examples of distressed suppliers, even smaller ones, which have significantly disrupted our operations because of shortages we've had to address. Over the last 18 months, we have incurred impacts approaching $200 million from individual distressed suppliers and other supply chain pressures, which have been reflected in our past earnings. These challenges in the supply chain also drove some of the forward losses recorded in the second quarter, primarily on the 787, the A350 and the A220 programs. Our priority for the second half of the year remains on execution within our factories and managing these supply chain challenges to meet production rate increases. While we continue to expect supply chain challenges, we have put plans in place to help mitigate the impacts. We have Spirit employees in the field, working with suppliers regularly, addressing rate readiness, helping them buy material, extending contracts and offloading work to release some of the pressure. As we've mentioned previously, in our own factories, we are bringing in new employees earlier than we have in the past to help ensure a smoother transition on production rate breaks. Expectations for deliveries on our other programs for the year are as follows: 40 to 45 shipsets on 787, about 60 shipsets on the A350, 580 shipsets on the A320 and 75 to 80 shipsets on the A220. Now let's move to an update of our defense and aftermarket businesses which both continue to perform well toward our 2025 targets. Our Defense &amp; Space business once again produced strong revenue growth, up 30% this quarter compared to the second quarter of 2022. The new business pipeline also remains robust, and we continue to make good inroads with the defense primes, displaying our design build capabilities and commercial best practices. Year-to-date, we have won 20 different contracts worth more than $200 million in total. We continue to bid on large defense programs and are on track to reach our target of $1 billion in Defense and Space revenue by 2025. Our Aftermarket business also had another quarter of solid revenue growth, up 15% compared to the same quarter last year, driven by increased MRO and spares volume with strong operating margins of 26%, helped by some onetime items. The aftermarket team also remains on plan to reach their 2025 revenue target of $500 million. I'll now turn the call over to Mark to take you through some more of the financials for our results. Over to you, Mark.Mark J. SuchinskiThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin by discussing the 2 significant items that occurred during the second quarter, the 737 vertical fin attached fitting rework and the Wichita IAM negotiations. The teams worked diligently throughout the quarter on the 737 vertical fin attached fitting rework related to the quality issue that we explained in April. We're pleased to have resolved the required rework on available units in Wichita within the $31 million cost estimate we discussed on the last earnings call. We recorded a contra-revenue charge of $23 million in the quarter to account for a potential claim from Boeing related to our estimate of the repair work to date at their facility, which we believe represents about half of the units. However, I want to emphasize that any potential claim we may receive from Boeing could be materially different from our estimate. Now as it relates to the IAM. The IAM negotiations and strike disruption affected all of our programs at the Wichita, Kansas site, which the 737 program was mostly impacted. Financial impacts during the quarter included $28 million of charges in the estimates primarily related to higher employee benefits, including wages from the new AIM contract as well as strike disruption charges of $7 million and higher excess capacity costs. Additionally, as we look ahead over the life of the new union contract, we are forecasting labor costs to be approximately $80 million more on an annual basis. This will put pressure on margins going forward in addition to the broader inflationary pressures we are experiencing. With the quality issue resolved in our factory and a new labor contract in place, our entire focus is directed towards executing on our customer commitments, including the upcoming production rate increases. Now let me take you through the details of our second quarter financial results. So let's move to Slide 2. Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, up 8% from the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter 2023 revenue was impacted by disruption from the vertical fin attached fitting issue as well as the IAM work stoppage. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to higher production on the 737 and 787 programs and increased Defense and Space revenue, partially offset by lower production on the A220 program. The Defense &amp; Space segment had a strong quarter with top line growth of 30%, increasing revenue by about $45 million. Also, aftermarket had a robust performance with 15% revenue growth and 26% margins. Overall, deliveries for the quarter increased 8% on a year-over-year basis. Now let's turn our attention to EPS. We reported earnings per share of negative $1.96 compared to negative $1.17 in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding certain items, adjusted EPS was negative $1.46 compared to negative $1.21 in the prior year. Operating margin decreased slightly to negative 9% compared to negative 8% in the same period of 2022, driven by higher changes in estimates as well as the potential customer claim that I discussed in my opening remarks, partially offset by the absence of losses related to the Russian sanctions recognized during the second quarter of 2022 and increased aftermarket earnings. Second quarter forward losses totaled $105 million, and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were $22 million. This is compared to $64 million of forward losses and $8 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments in the second quarter of 2022. The current quarter forward losses relate primarily to the 787, A350 and A220 programs. The 787 forward losses of $38 million resulted from the new IAM union contract as well as increased supply chain and other production-related costs. The A350 charges of $28 million were primarily due to increased costs related to production rate recovery efforts, including freight as well as unfavorable foreign currency movements, and the A220 loss of $27 million was driven by higher estimates of supply chain costs and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally, the unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments relate primarily to the 737 program, reflecting increased labor costs from the IAM union negotiations as well as higher supply chain costs. Other expense in the second quarter of this year was $10 million compared to other income of $35 million in the prior year. This variance was due to gain recorded in the second quarter of 2022 of $21 million related to the settlement of the repayable investment agreement with the U.K. Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy as well as lower pension income and higher foreign currency losses recognized in the quarter. Now let's turn to free cash flow. Free cash flow usage for the quarter was $211 million. Cash usage increased compared to the same period of 2022, largely driven by the negative impacts to working capital resulting from the rework and disruption related to the quality issue and the IAM work stoppage as well as preparation for the third quarter 737 production rate increase. Second quarter 2023 cash from operations was also included customer advances of $50 million as well as an excise tax payment of $36 million related to the termination of the pension value Plan A. Looking ahead, the new union contract was in line with our 2023 free cash flow expectations. However, the work stoppage resulting from the IAM work stoppage led to fewer 737 deliveries that will not be able to be made up in the back half of the year. We now expect full year 737 deliveries to be in the range of 370 to 390 units. Additionally, during these periods of disruption, we continue to receive materials and inventory to support our own supply chain, which caused additional pressure to free cash flows. These items, in combination with additional forward losses taken during the quarter will negatively impact full year cash flows. Given these headwinds, we are now expecting our free -- full year free cash flow to be in the range of negative $200 million to $250 million. This updated range includes the benefit of $100 million of customer advances, which I will explain in more detail on the next slide. With that, let's now turn to our cash and debt balances on Slide 3. We ended the quarter with $526 million of cash and $3.9 billion of debt. As I discussed on the last earnings call, as part of our subsequent event discussion, we entered into agreements during the second quarter with our customers to provide cash advances. As a result, we will receive $280 million this year, of which $230 million was received in the second quarter and $50 million will be received in the fourth quarter. We plan to repay these advances with payments of $90 million in 2024 and $190 million in 2025. $180 million of these advances were received from Boeing and are categorized as other liabilities on the balance sheet and reflected as cash from financing on the statement of cash flows. The remaining $100 million is categorized as advances on the balance sheet and reflected as cash from operations and therefore, included in free cash flow. Receiving these advances will help provide additional cushion as we incur the near-term financial impacts from the lower 737 deliveries and the buildup of inventory for production rate increases. We continue to have access to public financing markets, and we'll be looking at all available financing options to address our 2025 debt maturities as well as our overall liquidity. Next, let's discuss our segment performance, starting with Commercial segment on Slide 4. In the second quarter of 2023, Commercial revenue increased 5% over the same period of 2022, due to higher production volumes on the 737 and 787 programs, partially offset by lower A220 production. Commercial revenue was negatively impacted by disruptions from the vertical fin attached fitting issue and the IAM work stoppage. Quarterly, operating margin decreased to negative 7% compared to negative 4% in the prior year, driven by higher unfavorable changes in estimates in the current period and the potential customer claim offset by the absence of losses related to the Russian sanctions recognized during the second quarter of 2022. The changes in estimates during the second quarter, which I previously discussed, included forward losses of $102 million and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $16 million. In comparison to the second quarter of 2022, the segment recorded charges of $59 million of forward losses and $8 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2022, in relation to the sanctioned Russian business activities, the segment recognized net losses of $24 million. Now let's turn to Defense &amp; Space segment on Slide 5. Defense &amp; Space revenue grew to $190 million or 30% higher than the second quarter of last year due to higher development program activity and increased P-8 production. Operating margin for the quarter decreased to 6% compared to 9% in 2022, primarily due to increased costs on the P-8 and the KC-46 tanker resulting from the IAM union negotiations and higher supply chain costs as well as onetime charges on the Sikorsky CH-53K program. The segment recorded forward losses of $3 million, unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $6 million and excess capacity cost of $1 million compared to forward losses of $4 million and excess capacity cost of $2 million in the second quarter of 2022. For our Aftermarket segment results, let's turn to Slide 6. Aftermarket revenues were $92 million, up 15% compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher spare part sales and MRO activity. Aftermarket growth continues to be supported by the global recovery in air travel and is on track to meet the plan for the year. Operating margin was very strong for the quarter at 26%. However, don't expect it to continue at this level going forward. The increase compared to the same period of 2022 was primarily due to higher margins on increased activity, the absence of Russian sanction losses recognized during the second quarter of 2022 and a onetime benefit that will not repeat of $2 million. Despite the recent challenges, we believe we are moving in the right direction. Going forward, we are focused on the long-term trajectory of our business. Our top priority is on the execution and stability in our factories with rate increases in the back half of this year as well as in 2024 and 2025. Supply chain remains very challenged, but we will continue our efforts to mitigate the impact and improve predictability as the industry continues to recover. There is work to do, but demand is strong, and we are working hard to restore our operational and financial strength. Now let me turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments.Thomas C. GentileThanks, Mark. In summary, commercial aerospace demand is strong, and we are on the best platforms to take advantage of this demand. We worked through 2 recent challenging issues in the second quarter with the IAM contract and the vertical fin attached rework in Wichita. We expect that there will be continued challenges associated with the supply chain and stabilizing our factories going forward. We are making prudent investments and applying resources in the right places to help mitigate these challenges.Our focus in the back half of the year is on executing our production rate increases across all programs. We expect these actions will help enable us to drive sustained improvement in cash flows going forward. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Myles Walton of Wolfe Research.Myles Alexander WaltonMark, maybe you can start with the free cash flow. I think when I adjust for the advance, you've lowered it by about $200 million. And certainly have some discrete items. I guess I was thinking might add up to $100 million as opposed to the $200 million. So maybe you can just walk us through the -- maybe a little bit more discretely the elements of that $200 million revision.Mark J. SuchinskiSure, Myles. Good to hear from you. Yes, I think the big impacts really -- I've tried to cover it, first and foremost, with the work stoppage in Wichita, it's had an impact on deliveries and obviously, 737 is the most significant program we have but -- essentially June 20. And so there's going to be some of the deliveries that we won't be able to make up. There's the cost of that disruption. We're taking on more inventory to support the rate increase in the back half of the year, and we continue to bring on more inventory as a mitigator for some of the challenges that we've seen in our supply chain. I would also tell you that if you look at our forward loss, additional forward loss charges that we booked both in the first and second quarter, that's going to put pressure on cash in the back half of the year. So really, I think to summarize it, lower Boeing deliveries led by 737, us taking on more inventory to protect the production system and then higher forward loss charges that we book that will end up having a negative impact on cash. And I think those will put us within the new guide that we have here and the goal really is to set this guidance for you, deliver on this and make sure that we meet the cash flow targets that we've provided to you.Thomas C. GentileAnd Myles, I'd just add one other way to look at it which is where we are right now in the year. In Q1, we had a negative $69 million. In Q2, it was negative $211 million. So that put us at negative $280 million. And our goal is to be essentially breakeven in Q3 and Q4. And as Mark said, the next $50 million from the customer advance is going to be treated as cash flow. So that would put us at $230 million, which is right in the middle of our range of negative $200 million to $250 million.OperatorOur next question comes from Ken Herbert of RBC Capital Markets.Stephen Francis StrackhouseTom and Mark, this is Steve Strackhouse on for Ken Herbert. Last call, we had discussed about 75% of the 250 aircraft in Boeing's inventory. Potentially another 500 in the field. The Boeing has completed the rework on about half of those and the contract revenue amount is for $23 million. This implies a cost of about $67,000 per aircraft, which is about half of what you guys had said it was last quarter for yourselves. Is this a fair way to -- is it fair for us to think that the $23 million should effectively double? Or can you give us a little bit more color on the number of aircraft that Boeing has identified or the cost to them?Thomas C. GentileYes. No, that's -- Ken, so there's a few things that -- let me highlight and go through it. We think that they've repaired about half the units that they need to repair so call it, [73% or 74%]. So that is a little bit less than the 75% of the $250 million. So it's really the [73%] that they've repaired, the $23 million repair estimate aligns to that. And so we've tried to make some conservative estimates. And it's just based on the units that are at Boeing, nothing in the fleet. So our view is that as our understanding of the current disposition in the fleet is we don't expect any material impact for units in the fleet. So the $23 million only represents the units that are at Boeing and yes, it represents half of what we think is going to need to be done eventually. But that was the best estimate we could make. And so we took the charge based on the low end of that estimate.Mark J. SuchinskiYes. So I think if you do the math on that, you get a significantly different number than you quoted on the repair cost per unit.Thomas C. GentileI think, yes, I think you had that wrong.OperatorOur next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays.David Egon StraussSo the updated free cash flow forecast, I mean you've got -- in terms of nonrecurring positive, you got $100 million of advances. You've got the $180 million pension benefit. So apples-to-apples, it's kind of a $500 million burn this year. Is there any way to bridge still the positive free cash flow in 2024?Thomas C. GentileI mean the simple answer is rate increases, primarily on the 737. And that's going to also help the back half of this year. As I mentioned, we're basically moving to 42 aircraft per month cycling in August, and we'll continue at that rate for the rest of this year. And then next year, that will be our starting point. So the improvement in cash flow is really going to be delivering more aircraft, primarily the 737.Mark J. SuchinskiAnd also then, David, we won't need to build as much inventory spare parts as the -- and stores inventory as the supply chain continues to get healthy. So we're -- there's no doubt we're taking on a lot of inventory at this point in time to prepare for those higher production rates to drive stability. So as Tom said, I think the 2 primary drivers are higher deliveries, which will generate more gross profit, which generates cash. The higher production rates will help us absorb more excess costs, and that's cash cost that will be mitigated. And then the third component is getting to a much better place as it relates to inventory and getting past some of these one-off forward loss charges that are putting additional pressure on the current year cash flow.David Egon StraussOkay. A quick follow-up on the MAX rate. Can you just reconcile -- I think, Tom, you said you're still breaking the 42 here over the near term, but your implied second half of the year delivery guidance looks like it's averaging kind of 35 a month. So can you just reconcile that? And does Boeing or is there enough in buffer stock at this point given what it looks like here shortfall relative to Boeing's rate to allow Boeing to hit the 38 a month that they're now trying to achieve.Thomas C. GentileRight. So you're right. If you just do the math, if we're at 169 units delivered to date and you take the midpoint of our guidance on [370 to 390 to 380 units], that would imply $211 million for the back half of the year for 6 months, which is 35 per month. But the way I would say it is we're cycling at 42. So we've got the headcount in place. We've got 2 full lines, each producing 21 aircraft per month. So we are cycling at 42 per month. The reason it's a little bit less than 42 in the back half of the year is just unscheduled days, so m days that we are actually building. So you think about Labor Day, Thanksgiving, day after Thanksgiving and so forth. So there's several unscheduled days. And then in addition to that, we'll be firing blanks through the production line as we normally do to increase surge capacity and just provide some cushion into the production. So that's why the average is 35. But we are cycling now at 42 per month. We will end the year at -- delivering at 42 per month, and that will be the starting point for next year. In terms of the buffer, as you know, we built up buffer during the period of time when the MAX was grounded, and we were still building at 52 a month and delivering to Boeing at 42 per month. The good news is that, that buffer came in very handy during both the vertical fin issue and the strike. We were able to deliver more units from buffer to help minimize the disruption to Boeing. And so the buffer has gone down, but we still have about 50 to 55 units in Wichita, and then there's some others that are held up in Seattle. Some of those units are for customers that aren't going to deliver in the near term, like, for example, for China. But the buffer is still performing a very valuable function to ensure that we can meet Boeing's production rates as they go up and as we go up.OperatorOur next question comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan.Seth Michael SeifmanWhen we look at the continued forward loss charges on the A350 and the A220 and Spirit kind of having to absorb the supply chain challenges there, I guess when we think about Airbus as a customer, it seems like Spirit is losing money there. We'll continue to lose money there for a while. And we know from what Airbus says that they plan to continue to make structures a core internal capability for them. I mean does it -- at some point, is this not sustainable to continue working with them?Thomas C. GentileYes, yes. So thanks, Seth. I would say this is Airbus is a valued customer. They are 1 of the 2 big commercial manufacturers of aircraft in the world. And it's very important that Spirit as an aerostructure provider supports them as well as Boeing and also expands into defense. So I would say Airbus is an important customer, and we want to continue to develop and further that relationship. But I'd also say that you're absolutely right, the A350 and the A220 have been very challenged programs and have been in forward losses. And as we look broadly in the industry and air traffic is recovering, as I said in my remarks, there's obviously huge strong demand for aircraft. And we saw that at Paris, which was actually the third highest air show ever in terms of orders. So very high demand for aircraft. And yet, we're here in a very supply-constrained environment. And it's really important for the entire aerospace industry value chain to be financially healthy during this period, particularly as we go up in production rates. And so the way we see it is that suppliers, including Spirit, are experiencing inflation in materials, in logistics, in utilities, in labor, you just saw our increased labor costs, which are going to add about $80 million of cost per year. And on top of that, there's heightened expectations on quality, on fluctuating schedules. So all of these things are driving higher costs and programs, including on our Airbus programs, the A350 and A220, but also on our 787 program with Boeing. And these are important issues that the OEMs will need to address in the long term and these are important conversations that we are having right now with our customers.OperatorOur next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Melius Research.Robert Michael SpingarnJust a clarification and then a question on margins. But Tom, when you -- just in terms of the vertical fin issues and the installed fleet, I think you and Mark have said, you haven't establish that exposure? Is it because there isn't any or we're not there yet, the inspections haven't occurred and you don't have a way to do that. So that's the clarification. And then, Mark, since March '22, if we go back to the Investor Day back then, you talked about a 16.5% segment margin, free cash conversion is 7% to 9% of sales. When the 737 gets to 42, Tom, you just said you'll exit the year at that level, but a lot of things have changed since then, interest rates, higher inflation and now this new IAM deal that's $80 million more expensive. So when we bake all that in, how do we think about your margins factoring those various things in?Thomas C. GentileYes. So on the vertical fin, let me say it this way, so it's very clear. Based on the disposition as we understand it for the fleet, we do not expect that there will be any material financial impact to Spirit based on that disposition, okay. So we don't expect any material financial...Robert Michael SpingarnBecause they don't need to...Thomas C. GentileThe way the disposition will work, we don't expect there to be a financial impact, a material financial impact for Spirit. And that disposition is still being finalized, but that is our understanding of it as of right now, and that's how we are communicating it. Okay. So with regard to the second part of your question, the 16.5% margins, 7% to 9% free cash flow conversion when we get to 42 aircraft per month. Obviously, those were made before this hyperinflationary environment, before our new labor contract, before a lot of schedule changes, before a lot of different expectations in terms of how we build the aircraft. And so what we would say now is, yes, there's more pressure. Once we get stabilized, we'll revisit and determine what those projections will be for the future. But obviously, right now, there's more pressure because those estimates were made before a lot of what we know today occurred.Robert Michael SpingarnOkay. And then just on the $80 million, what size business does that contemplate? Is that where you are now? Is that a cost when things stabilize, what production volume [that's like $80 million].Thomas C. GentileIt's based on what we are currently at and what we project over the next 4 years of the term of the contract.Mark J. SuchinskiYes. So Rob, that -- it's an average. Obviously, it's a little lower today. We'll be hiring more people over the next couple of years as rates go up, but that is an average over the 4-year period. So a little lower today, higher in year 3, 4.OperatorOur next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies.Sheila Karin KahyaogluI just wanted to step back from the cash outflows today and maybe specifically focusing on the MAX contribution in '23, '24 and '25. Obviously, work stoppages, pauses and IAM agreements change the free cash flow profile of the MAX in '23. How do you think about that in '24 and '25 and how does the rate and inventory depletion progress?Thomas C. GentileSheila, I'll answer first and then let Mark provide a little bit of detail. But the first thing is, you're right, in '23, the work stoppage did impact us, and we lowered our guidance in terms of the deliveries for the MAX as a result. But the good news is that we do now have our contract in place with the IAM, and it's for 4 years, and we're satisfied with that. It's a very competitive contract and it reflects the gratitude that we have to our IAM colleagues for their contributions. So it impacted '23 but as we go into '24 and '25, we have stability now on that front and we will be able to execute on our rate increases and the rates that we expect to be delivering. And those will be higher. So as I said, we are already moving to 42 aircraft per month in terms of what where we're cycling. We'll end the year at that and that will be the starting point for next year. And we do expect that we'll have at least 1 rate increase in 2024 as well over the 42. So if you lay that out, because the MAX is our biggest program, and deliveries are going to be going up is that will drive more free cash flow. And now we have a more stable environment with the contract in our rearview mirror.Mark J. SuchinskiYes. Sheila, I think the thing that I would add is the quality issue, the vertical fin, the work stoppage, that caused significant disruption to us. Significant, right? And it was obviously not planned at the start of the year, much lower deliveries in the second quarter. We've had to add more people. We've -- we're taking deliveries out of the plan. It had serious impacts to the overall cash flow projection for the year. And as we move into 2024, we move past the work stoppage. We moved -- as Tom said, we moved past the quality issue. It's all about execution. It's about stabilizing supply chain and producing on time in our factories and meeting our delivery commitments on time, right? And so the positive cash flow is all 100% based on the further stabilization of supply chain and meeting our production commitments internally. And if we can go do that, we'll see a significant improvement in overall free cash flow and that's what we have to do. Operationally, we've got to execute. We've got to execute better, and that will lead with the higher production rates to much better profitability and cash flow.Sheila Karin KahyaogluSo how does that change just like your free cash flow margin per aircraft on the MAX? Like if it was close to 20% before, does it lower at 500 bps? So I'm thinking like instead of $1.2 million per MAX, you're down to $1 million with all these changes.Mark J. SuchinskiWell, I'd say this, Sheila. I mean, we tried to be really, really granular as it relates to the IAM impact. And I would tell you, when you think about, as you just said, the cash per unit, the biggest driver as we look forward on the 737 is the impacts of the IAM contract. You know that it's over 50% of our revenues as a company but much higher than that as it relates to Wichita. And so I think that you can put some math to the negative impacts or the higher cost and the pressure that's going to put on our overall business and a big portion of that is going to hit the 737.Thomas C. GentileAnd Sheila, the way I would also say it is as we've said before, is you always have to run fast in this industry to stand still. We're always facing pressures. We knew the IAM contract was going to create additional financial pressure, and it did and we need to continue to work to mitigate that through our productivity initiatives.OperatorOur next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein.Douglas Stuart HarnedI wanted to go over to the wide-bodies. And when you look at the 787 and the A350 and can you tell us what the rates are you're at now? And when you look forward, you have Airbus standing by, producing 9 a month at the end of 2025, Boeing on the 787, 10 a month in 2025, '26. Where are you now? And how do you get to those high numbers?Thomas C. GentileRight. Well, as it sits right now, Doug, both on 87 and 350, we're really at about 5 per month right now in terms of what we're delivering at. And so as I mentioned in my remarks, we're going to deliver between 40 and 45 87s this year and about 60 or so A350s. But the rate right now on both programs is about 5. Now Boeing has said they're going to go up to high as 10 at the end of '24. And Airbus has said, I think high as 9 in 2025, which would include some freighters. And so the way we get up to those rates -- we have already the capital because we've been up as high as 14 on 787. Now there is some more pressure on the build process because things have changed, the fitting finish issue on 787 and the pull-up force, it has resulted in some change in the build process, which puts some pressure on it. But we have a lot of the capital and tooling to get up to 14. And so it's really a question of adding the headcount and making sure we adjust and take into account some of the changes in the build process. And that's how it will happen on 787. On A350, we're capitalized for 13 aircraft per month, and we've been as high as 10. And so obviously, we're at a much lower rate right now. There's some differences there in terms of build process as well, but it's really a question of hiring the people in our Kinston plant and our Saint-Nazaire plant to increase the rates to what Airbus is expecting. The other thing I would say, though, is the freighter, which is in development right now is going to be a substantially different aircraft. I mean it's a derivative, but there's a lot of changes to it. And so that will also put a little bit of pressure on the system. And it's kind of a version of the 10. And so that creates another minor model mix, let's say, so some additional complexity. But the capital is in place to get up to rate 9 as Airbus is expecting, and we just need to start hiring the people at the right time period so that they're ready to meet those rate increases.Douglas Stuart HarnedWell, should we expect and we shouldn't expect any additional capital investment requirements. But next year, just trying to dimension the pressure that this ramp-up from a staffing standpoint, what is that going to suggest in terms of just pressure on your margins and cash next year?Thomas C. GentileYes. Well, since both of those programs are in forward loss, that's the normal type of pressure. We've built into our projections in the out years, the increase in head count to support higher rates, but you also get the benefit when you have higher rates, of course, of better fixed cost absorption. And so that will be an offsetting benefit. But I'll just get back to what I said a little bit earlier, when Seth asked the question about the forward loss charges, is this is an industry-wide problem and in a kind of a very high demand environment, which also has supply constraints, it's important that all the suppliers are healthy and suppliers are incurring higher levels of cost on inflation and material as well as labor, logistics and utilities. And these do have to be addressed in the long term, and these are the conversations that we're having with our OEM partners.OperatorNext question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.George D. ShapiroMark, just a clarification. The $80 million you said was an average. I mean, if I look at the wage changes, they go up like 11% from '23 to '25. So I just assume that, that $80 million was really like a 2024 number, forgetting the people you got to hire. That was just kind of the average wage per individual, right?Mark J. SuchinskiYes, it's about right, George.George D. ShapiroOkay. And then one other quick clarification. What is different between the agreement you have on the advance from Boeing versus Airbus that lets Airbus be counted as free cash flow and Boeing is financing?Mark J. SuchinskiSure, George. So the main fundamental difference between the $180 million advance from we got from Boeing and the $100 million from another customer is the Boeing Advance is paid to us. We've collected that money and we make a onetime payment to Boeing in the first quarter of 2024 of $90 million, just the payment to them like paying back a bank, and we do that in 2025. The other customer wanted its structure differently at the end of the day for their own reasons. And so we're paying that one back in a per shipset quantity in 2025. So essentially, we're paying it back in 2025. So I think the other way you can look at it, it's a prepayment that we received $100 million against deliveries that we're making in 2025 and so from an ASC 606 accounting standpoint, that results in us -- that requires us to treat that as in cash from operations as an advance and so again, it's really more of a technical accounting item. It's -- at the end of the day, it's not operational, but technical accounting wise, it results in us having to have to treat it in 2023 as favorable to free cash flow and in '25, that will be a negative impact to free cash flow in 2025.OperatorOur next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr of TD Cowen.Cai von RumohrSo 2 questions on cash flow. First, while the 737 build is a big plus, the 787, 350 and 220 are basically losers. So as those rates build, what is the incremental build in terms of the forward loss burn off. And then secondly, because you have the Boeing repayments are below the line, will you be able, over the period, '24 and '25 to reduce your debt?Thomas C. GentileYes. Well, let me just address the forward loss issue. As you said, on 737, the impact will be positive on 87 and 220. In terms of the forward loss, we've taken into account the projections in terms of the schedules going forward going up. So that has all been taking into account in terms of the forward loss. In terms of the Boeing payment being below the line, that is how it is. But what was the second part of your question then, Cai, the second part?Cai von RumohrWell, I mean, so with those 3 programs building, presumably the cash loss as you move forward, increase's. That's why you took the forward loss. And then you do have the Boeing payments and you have the cash payment to Airbus, at least the cash that you don't get. So over the 2-year period, will you be able to reduce your overall net debt.Mark J. SuchinskiCai, let me jump in real quick. So I think first off, we do have loss-making programs. We talk about those. I would tell you that the amount of burn on those cash -- those forward loss programs in 2023 will be higher than '24, right? Even though we're going to produce more in '24. We started to ramp up on 787, we didn't restart production until August of last year. And we had a lot of units as we slowly started to go from 1 to 3 to 5, a lot of higher costs, way up on the learning curve, the build process changed. So we're seeing an abnormally high cost per unit build on 787 in 2023. And you're seeing some of that reflected in the additional forward losses that we booked in the first and second quarters. Very similar on A350 as we recovered the production plan from an overstaffing standpoint to recover that expedited boats that is all putting additional pressure on what I would call cash per unit on the loss-making programs in 2023. And then as we move into 2024, what should happen is we're moving down. We've got more stability in those factories. The higher rates will help us absorb more fixed costs. Some of the pressure that we saw in 2023 will abate as we move in 2024. There are still loss-making programs. A220 goes up in rate, a nice little tick-up in 2024, which will help. So I would say when you think about cash between '23 and '24, yes, there's cash consumption on the loss-making contracts in '23, and there will be on 2024. But I would tell you, based on our -- what we believe today, it will be less impactful in '24 than '23. And so when you think about cash flow over the next couple of years, obviously, the issues around the quality issue and the strike has moved the cash flow generation a bit to the right. And therefore, we won't be able to generate significant cash flow in '24 and '25. There will be some cash that we're able to generate, which we'll use to pay down debt as best we can as we move through that. And so really, that's the game plan. I think more burn on the forward loss this year, a little bit less next year. And as we move into '24 and '25, and we move the cash flow positive, we will use that cash flow to pay down debt, and that's part of -- that's overall when we think about our overall financing strategy and liquidity strategy on how we're addressing our debt and our cash balances.Thomas C. GentileYes. And Cai, what I would say about that is we will use the excess cash in '24 and '25 to start to pay down debt. But we have a big chunk that's due in April of 2025. We are not going to be able to generate enough cash to pay all of that off. So we are going to start to look at some refinancing options, and we'll consider all different types of options, as Mark said in his comments, as we look to refinance that 2025 debt.Cai von RumohrVery helpful. You mentioned price hikes. One of the messages from Paris was that pretty much everyone is asking for and most people are getting price hikes. Do your forecast and your comments assume any price hikes?Thomas C. GentileNo, they do not. Not at this time.OperatorOur next question comes from Kristine Liwag of Morgan Stanley.Kristine Tan LiwagSo in terms of follow-up to question earlier, I mean aerospace is still largely duopoly and therefore, both Boeing and Airbus are important customers. But you've got programs like the 787 and the A350 that have been negative free cash flow for over a decade now, and you've got additional pressures for the A220 and even defense. With costs continue to increase with labor and supply chain still kind of fragile in some spots, I mean, more pain seems to be unsustainable. At what point do you go back to the customer, I mean despite their importance and renegotiate pricing? And if they're not willing to negotiate, like what's your walkaway point of returning some of these programs back to your customers?Thomas C. GentileWell, Kristine, you raised very good points. And it's a situation that exists both on the commercial side and on the defense side with the large primes is the impact of inflation especially when you have a fixed-price contract has an impact. And as I said, it's a broader industry issue in terms of the fact that there's a huge demand out there right now as their traffic recovers, but there's all these supply constraints and there's pressures on the supply chain in terms of inflation in material and labor, logistics and utilities, new build processes, fluctuating schedules. And so I would say the -- the issue is we are under contract, and we are going to meet our contractual commitments to our customers. But really, the OEMs and the U.S. government from a defense standpoint, do have to recognize the environment has changed and it's a highly inflationary environment. And these are very important conversations that we have to have with our customers.Kristine Tan LiwagAnd in terms of getting some of that pricing alleviation, I mean we're hearing from your peers they're getting better pricing and attrition or even the challenges in supply chain. Is there something different specifically with your long-term agreement to make it more difficult for you to get that pricing increase?Thomas C. GentileWell, our long-term agreements are typical, I would say, the industry, their requirements contracts. We are fortunate that we have these contracts that our life of program, usually sole source. And these are extremely unique contracts and they're on all the best programs. I mean if you look at the 737, we make 70% of the structure on the 737 for Boeing, including the entire fuselage. On the 320, we make about 60% of the structure for the wing with Airbus. We have a huge work package on the A350 with the center fuselage and the fixed leading edge. And on the 220, we make 3 sections of the center fuselage, the entire wing, including all the systems, and we make the [fuselage]. So when you think about the industry and narrow-body aircraft being so important, we have the biggest work packages by far on the narrow-body programs. It's 85% of our backlog. So we feel very fortunate that we have those positions on those contracts. Yes, so that there has been a big change in the environment with inflation both in material and labor, utilities and logistics, different build processes, different rates that are still lower than we were overall back in 2019. And so those are realities and the OEMs are fully aware of it. And as I said, these are discussions that we need to be having with the OEMs at this time.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of Truist Securities.Michael Frank CiarmoliI guess just staying on Kristine's point, with these contracts? I mean you're boasting you're on the best programs, but seemingly, you're just not getting compensated or paid for the value you're providing. And I guess, you're saying some of these things have to be addressed. How receptive are Boeing and Airbus, their sense of urgency. I mean do you think you can get something changed here in the shorter term to capture some pricing. And then I guess maybe even you still have, I guess, the price step-downs as you go up in volumes. I mean, is that something that you're looking very closely at. I think if you can remind us, I think 42 was sort of the optimal rate for the 737, but once you go above that, you're going to start getting price step down. It just seems like you're getting squeezed from all sides here. And maybe there should be more urgency and I get it running fast to stay still, but that doesn't really sound like a good proposition for shareholders.Thomas C. GentileIt's a challenging environment, and I think we all recognize that. It's much more inflationary in material. And with these new labor contracts, now you see that in labor as well. And as I've said, it's an industry-wide problem because demand is clearly there. The orders are coming in, production rates are going up, but all suppliers are facing challenges with these higher level of costs. And so it's an important systemic issue that the OEMs do need to address. And it's important that we have these conversations with them. And I can't put any sort of time frame on it. Discussions like these are always difficult and challenging. But it's something that we are prepared to have for the reasons that you just outlined.Mark J. SuchinskiYes, Michael, I would just add to just try to be clear, there is a sense of urgency by the management team here, okay? We hear you. We understand. We've got a lot of work to do on this end.OperatorOur next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America.Ronald Jay EpsteinMaybe the elephant in the room, I'll just bring it up. People have been sort of beating around it. Is there a fundamental change that you have to make in Spirits business to make it less volatile and just more predictable because it always seems like you guys end up on the tail of the whip, A220, A320, 737, they're great programs like Michael said, but they don't seem to be helping you right now, although they're helping the OEMs. You must, I mean, if you can give us some feeling for how you're thinking about strategy and how you could change Spirit to make it a more -- I don't want to say viable, but less volatile business that the public markets could view easier, right? Because things swinging all over the place. It seems like you guys always end up with the short end of the stick, and that just doesn't seem fair.Thomas C. GentileSo as I said, it's a challenging environment right now. And on our narrow-body contracts, we have sole-source life of program and we have great work packages. And those rates are going up. The challenge has really been on some of the wider body contracts and more of the composite programs. So if you look at the 3 programs that are in forward loss, the 87, the 350 and the 220, those are all composite programs, and that has been more challenging. We've not come down the learning curve as fast as we all thought we would when they first started. And so we do need to have the conversations about how we address that given the inflationary environment that we're in. But let me see, you said, what can we do to improve and change fundamental changes in Spirit. A lot of it is in our production system. And these are investments we've been making over the last 3, 4 years during the pandemic to improve the flow of our factories, improve digitization and automation and robotics and drive quality in a much more fundamental way. And those are going to start to pay dividends as we go up in rate. So you will see that. The other broader thing, I would say, you said about strategy is when we went into the pandemic, we were too concentrated. We were 95% commercial. We were 98% original equipment. We were about 75% Boeing and 50% of our revenue came from MAX. We were too concentrated. And so we've made a concerted effort over the last 4 years, including during the pandemic, to start to diversify. And that diversification, a big part of it was the acquisition we made from Bombardier in Belfast, Morocco and Dallas to give us more Airbus content, to give us twice as much aftermarket and 4x as much business yet. And so the diversification will start to pay dividends over time. As we've said, we want to be $1 billion in defense by 2025. We want to be $500 million in aftermarket by 2025. And so those are some of the things that we're doing to fundamentally change Spirit is improving the factory and delivering productivity through all of the different advanced manufacturing initiatives I said, having discussions with the OEMs about the composite programs and the material system and the challenges that we've incurred over time and then continuing the diversification of Spirit so that we're less concentrated in the future with a broader exposure to Defense &amp; Space as well as aftermarket.Ronald Jay EpsteinAnd I mean, if I may, as a follow-on. When we look at Belfast, specifically, has that created any value, I mean to this point? And when would you expect it to do so?Thomas C. GentileIt's where we expected it to be. Rates are a little bit lower, and that's driven some of the forward losses. But when we did the program, we knew it was going to be a challenge. We took a purchase accounting charge of about $375 million through 2025. And we expected that the rates would get up to 14 or 15 by the middle of 2025. Now that could get pushed out, but that's still what Airbus is saying. The A220, we think, is a great program. It is 100 and the 300 right now take it from about 100 passengers up to 150 passengers. It's got a brand-new engine and a geared turbo fan. It's a lightweight fuselage, and it's a fully composite wing, all of which we make. And so it is a very efficient aircraft. The airlines do like it. I know it's had some operational challenges, which they're working through and they'll get that right. But it's a great program. And someday, they might extend it up to 500, which would take it up to 170 passengers, which would increase the rate even further. So we made a big bet on the A220 program. We're happy with that bet. We think it's a great strategic program. It's taking a little bit longer to realize. But in the long term, it was a good strategic move. We're happy we did it. It's going to help diversify Spirit because in addition to the A220 program that we got out of Belfast, we also doubled our aftermarket, and we got 4x the amount of business jet work. So we think it was a good deal and it will pay off in the long term.OperatorOur final question comes from Peter Arment of Baird.Peter J. ArmentMark, maybe I'll just try to end on a positive note, aftermarket mix or the margins where it was very strong this quarter. Just any one time to call out? Or was it just mix and how sustainable is it?Mark J. SuchinskiThanks, Peter, and good to hear from you. We're really happy with aftermarket. It continues to grow. It's hitting our revenue targets for the year. It's performing from an operational delivery performance margin perspective and we've talked about it being a 20-plus percent margin business. There are a couple of small things that happened in the second quarter that won't repeat when we think about the third and fourth quarter. But the team is executing. I want to congratulate our aftermarket team. They're hitting their big revenue goals for the year. They're performing well for the customers. We continue to grow geographically and expand our portfolio. And so we're really pleased with that. And as we move through the balance of the year, we're going to continue to drive execution and hit the 20-plus percent margins. And as Tom talked about, we're right on track, $500 million, 20-plus percent margins. And although it doesn't seem as large as our commercial business, it's going to be a nice contributor as we grow over the next couple of years. So Peter, I appreciate you asking the question. We're happy with the team. We're hitting the marks, and we are very, very focused on continuing growing that business and making sure that it produces accretive margins.OperatorWe have no further questions on the line. With that, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.]"

Quanta believes this measure enables management to more effectively forecast its future capital needs and results and better identify future operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. Quanta believes this measure is also useful for investors in forecasting Quanta's future results and comparing Quanta to its competitors. Quanta's remaining performance obligations, as described above, are a component of its backlog calculation, which also includes estimated orders under master service agreements (MSAs), including estimated renewals, and non-fixed price contracts expected to be completed within one year. Quanta's methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies.The following table reconciles Quanta's total remaining performance obligations to total backlog by reportable segment, along with estimates of amounts expected to be realized within 12 months:June 30, 2023December 31, 2022June 30, 202212 MonthTotal12 MonthTotal12 MonthTotalElectric Power Infrastructure SolutionsRemaining performance obligations$    2,584,140$    4,128,988$    2,124,820$    3,033,472$    2,149,469$    2,779,227Estimated orders under MSAs and short-term, non-fixed price contracts4,948,0809,454,8585,415,42710,049,4354,230,8888,945,444Backlog$    7,532,220$  13,583,846$    7,540,247$  13,082,907$    6,380,357$  11,724,671Renewable Energy Infrastructure SolutionsRemaining performance obligations$    5,048,636$    6,801,436$    3,183,568$    4,638,115$    2,299,898$    2,911,835Estimated orders under MSAs and short-term, non-fixed price contracts118,333206,10257,55584,09452,34590,553Backlog$    5,166,969$    7,007,538$    3,241,123$    4,722,209$    2,352,243$    3,002,388Underground Utility and Infrastructure SolutionsRemaining performance obligations$    1,184,061$    1,546,395$    1,038,543$    1,129,837$    1,023,556$    1,229,157Estimated orders under MSAs and short-term, non-fixed price contracts1,755,7975,057,4351,973,9825,158,8141,820,5603,894,014Backlog$    2,939,858$    6,603,830$    3,012,525$    6,288,651$    2,844,116$    5,123,171TotalRemaining performance obligations$    8,816,837$  12,476,819$    6,346,931$    8,801,424$    5,472,923$    6,920,219Estimated orders under MSAs and short-term, non-fixed price contracts6,822,21014,718,3957,446,96415,292,3436,103,79312,930,011Backlog$  15,639,047$  27,195,214$  13,793,895$  24,093,767$  11,576,716$  19,850,230 Quanta Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per ShareAttributable to Common StockFor the Three and Six Months EndedJune 30, 2023 and 2022(In thousands, except per share information)(Unaudited)The following table presents the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted net income attributable to common stock to net income attributable to common stock and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the three and  six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. These reconciliations are intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta's performance. Management believes that the exclusion of certain items from net income attributable to common stock and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock enables it and Quanta's investors to more effectively evaluate Quanta's operations period over period and better identify operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. However, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to common stock and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock or other measures of performance that are derived in accordance with GAAP.As to certain of the items in the table: (i) non-cash stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; (ii) amortization of intangible assets and amortization included in equity in earnings are impacted by Quanta's acquisition activities and investments in integral unconsolidated affiliates, and therefore can vary from period to period; (iii) acquisition and integration costs vary from period to period depending on the level of Quanta's acquisition activity; (iv) change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities varies from period to period depending on the performance in post-acquisition periods of certain acquired businesses and the effect of present value accretion on fair value calculations; (v) equity in (earnings) losses of non-integral unconsolidated affiliates varies from period to period depending on the activity and financial performance of such affiliates, the operations of which are not operationally integral to Quanta; (vi) unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on Quanta's investment in a publicly traded company vary from period to period based on fluctuations in the market price of such company's common stock; (vii) gains and losses on the sales of investments vary from period to period depending on activity; and (viii) asset impairment charges vary from period to period depending on economic and other factors.Beginning with the period ended December 31, 2022, adjusted net income attributable to common stock and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock exclude the impact of amortization included in equity in earnings of integral unconsolidated affiliates. As described further above, management believes that excluding the impact of this item allows Quanta's investors and management to more effectively evaluate Quanta's operations between periods and identify operating trends. As a result of these changes, the calculation of adjusted net income attributable to common stock and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 have been recast to conform to the current presentation.Because adjusted net income attributable to common stock and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, as defined, exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to common stock and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The most comparable GAAP financial measures, net income attributable to common stock and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are included in the table to follow.Quanta Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per ShareAttributable to Common Stock For the Three and Six Months EndedJune 30, 2023 and 2022 (In thousands, except per share information)(Unaudited)Three Months EndedSix Months EndedJune 30,June 30,2023202220232022Reconciliation of adjusted net income attributable to common stock:Net income attributable to common stock (GAAP as reported)$  165,899$     88,020$  260,945$  172,661Adjustments:Acquisition and integration costs (a)2,28414,19122,17229,322Asset impairment charges —2,800—2,800Change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities—809—5,978Equity in earnings of non-integral unconsolidated affiliates(468)(9,611)(2,085)(14,949)Unrealized loss from mark-to-market adjustment on investment (b)—41,654—50,047Gains on sales of investments(674)—(1,496)(6,696)Income tax impact of adjustments (c)(257)(9,566)(4,220)(13,897)Adjusted net income attributable to common stock before certain non-cash adjustments 166,784128,297275,316225,266Non-cash stock-based compensation 34,60728,09062,05851,082Amortization of intangible assets70,025107,945142,428223,696Amortization included in equity in earnings of integral unconsolidated affiliates1,4654743,261947Income tax impact of non-cash adjustments (c)(27,613)(35,522)(54,070)(71,749)Adjusted net income attributable to common stock (d)$  245,268$  229,284$  428,993$  429,242Weighted average shares:Weighted average shares outstanding for diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share148,773148,211148,717148,327Earnings per share attributable to common stock:Diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock$         1.12$         0.59$         1.75$         1.16Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock (d)$         1.65$         1.55$         2.88$         2.89(a) The amounts for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 include, among other things, expenses associated with change of control payments as a result of Quanta's acquisition of Blattner Holding Company and its operating subsidiaries (Blattner).(b) The amounts for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 are unrealized losses related to the fair value remeasurement of Quanta's common stock investment in Starry Group Holdings, Inc., a broadband technology provider.(c) The income tax impact of adjustments that are subject to tax is determined using the incremental statutory tax rates of the jurisdictions to which each adjustment relates for the respective periods.(d) As described above, adjusted net income attributable to common stock and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 have been recast to conform to the current period presentation. Quanta Services, Inc. and SubsidiariesReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAFor the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022(In thousands)(Unaudited)The following table presents reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to common stock for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.

EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest and other financing expenses, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain other items as described below. These measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common stock or other financial measures of performance that are derived in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the exclusion of these items from net income attributable to common stock enables it and Quanta's investors to more effectively evaluate Quanta's operations period over period and to identify operating trends that might not be apparent when including the excluded items.As to certain of the items below: (i) non-cash stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; (ii) acquisition and integration costs vary from period to period depending on the level of Quanta's acquisition activity; (iii) equity in (earnings) losses of non-integral unconsolidated affiliates varies from period to period depending on the activity and financial performance of such affiliates, the operations of which are not operationally integral to Quanta; (iv) unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on Quanta's investment in a publicly traded company vary from period to period based on fluctuations in the market price of such company's common stock; (v) gains and losses on the sales of investments vary from period to period depending on activity; (vi) change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities varies from period to period depending on the performance in post-acquisition periods of certain acquired businesses and the effect of present value accretion on fair value calculations; and (vi) asset impairment charges can vary from period to period depending on economic and other factors. Because EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, as defined, exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to common stock, such measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

This reconciliation is intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate Quanta's ability to generate the cash required to maintain and potentially expand its business. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures. Net capital expenditures is defined as capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and from insurance settlements related to property and equipment. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to Quanta's investors because free cash flow is viewed by management as an important indicator of how much cash is provided or used by routine business operations, including the impact of net capital expenditures. Management uses this measure for capital allocation purposes as it is viewed as a measure of cash available to fund debt payments, acquire businesses, repurchase common stock and debt securities, declare and pay dividends and transact other investing and financing activities. However, this measure should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance that are derived in accordance with GAAP.

Available commitments for revolving loans under the senior credit facility must be maintained in order to provide credit support for notes issued under the commercial paper program, and therefore such notes effectively reduce the available borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility. Quanta Services, Inc. and SubsidiariesReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresEstimated Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per ShareAttributable to Common StockFor the Full Year 2023(In thousands, except per share information)(Unaudited)The following table presents reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measure of estimated adjusted net income attributable to common stock to estimated net income attributable to common stock and the non-GAAP financial measure of estimated adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to estimated diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the full year ending December 31, 2023.

Additionally, sequential improvements in the residential market and recently increased remodeling activities are encouraging.Per the latest Earnings Outlook, the Q2 earnings season has seen releases from approximately 46.2% of the construction companies on the S&amp;P 500 Index. Of them, the sector’s total earnings are down 11.9% from the year-ago period on 3.5% higher revenues, with 100% beating earnings per share estimates and 83.3% beating revenue estimates.The construction sector earnings listed on the S&amp;P 500 Index are expected to decline 14.3% year over year in the to-be-reported quarter, compared with the 19.1% fall registered in first-quarter 2023. Revenues are projected to increase 3.4% year over year versus a rise of 2.8% recorded in the last reported quarter.What’s Driving the Sector?The rising demand for infrastructural activities for public project work is expected to have supported growth for the non-residential players. Strong global trends in infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security and a potential super-cycle in global supply-chain investments will have aided the sector. Increased fiber deployments in the telecommunications networks to provide gigabit network speeds to individual consumers and businesses using 5G technologies are likely to have acted as tailwinds for these companies’ quarterly performance.Other factors like favorable weather, prudent cost-saving efforts, a disciplined approach to bidding, project management, buyouts synergies and increased road repair and maintenance works are added positives.Although residential and remodelling markets are low year over year, they have improved sequentially. The desire to own a home amid a lack of existing homes for sale, focus on cost control, increased operating leverage and important buyouts will likely help the companies to partially offset accelerated mortgage rates, increased raw material and labor cost woes.These above-mentioned tailwinds are expected to have contributed to the quarterly performances of Quanta Services, Inc.

Learn more at thecignagroup.com. Notes:1.Adjusted income (loss) from operations is a principal financial measure of profitability used by The Cigna Group's management because it presents the underlying results of operations of the Company's businesses and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and shareholders' net income. Adjusted income from operations is defined as shareholders' net income (or income before income taxes less pre-tax income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the segment metric) excluding net realized investment results, amortization of acquired intangible assets and special items. The Cigna Group's share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the Cigna Healthcare segment using the equity method of accounting are also excluded. Special items are matters that management believes are not representative of the underlying results of operations due to their nature or size. Adjusted income (loss) from operations is measured on an after-tax basis for consolidated results and on a pre-tax basis for segment results. Consolidated adjusted income (loss) from operations is not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income. See Exhibit 1 for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted income from operations to shareholders' net income.2.Management is not able to provide a reconciliation of adjusted income from operations to shareholders' net income (loss) or adjusted revenues to total revenues on a forward-looking basis because it is unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, certain components thereof including (i) future net realized investment results (from equity method investments with respect to adjusted revenues) and (ii) future special items. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond The Cigna Group's control. As such, any associated estimate and its impact on shareholders' net income and total revenues could vary materially. The Company's outlook excludes the potential effects of any other business combinations that may occur after the date of this earnings release. The Company's outlook includes the potential effects of expected future share repurchases and anticipated 2023 dividends.As announced in January 2021, The Cigna Group currently intends to pay regular quarterly dividends, with future declarations subject to approval by its Board of Directors and the Board's determination that the declaration of dividends remains in the best interests of The Cigna Group and its shareholders. The decision of whether to pay future dividends and the amount of any such dividends will be based on the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements, the requirements of applicable law and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant.The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternate uses of capital. The share repurchase program may be effected through open market purchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, or privately negotiated transactions. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.3.Effective January 1, 2023, The Cigna Group adopted ASU 2018-12, Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts, and related amendments. Prior year results have been restated to reflect the adoption of the new accounting guidance.4.On July 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses in six countries (Hong Kong, Indonesia, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand) to Chubb INA Holdings, Inc. (""Chubb"") for approximately $5.4 billion in cash (the ""Chubb transaction""). In December 2022, the Company divested its ownership interest in a joint venture in Türkiye.5.Adjusted revenues is used by The Cigna Group's management because it permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue. The Company defines adjusted revenues as total revenues excluding the following adjustments: special items and The Cigna Group's share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the Cigna Healthcare segment using the equity method of accounting. Special items are matters that management believes are not representative of the underlying results of operations due to their nature or size. We exclude these items from this measure because management believes they are not indicative of past or future underlying performance of the business. Adjusted revenues is not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, total revenues. See Exhibit 1 for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted revenues to total revenues.6.Operating ratios are defined as follows:The Cigna Healthcare medical care ratio (""MCR"") represents medical costs as a percentage of premiums for all U.S. Commercial risk products, including medical, pharmacy, dental, stop loss and behavioral products provided through guaranteed cost or experience-rated funding arrangements, as well as Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, Medicare Supplement, individual on and off-exchange products, and health care products within our International Health business, within the Cigna Healthcare segment.SG&amp;A expense ratio on a GAAP basis for the second quarter 2023 represents enterprise selling, general and administrative expenses of $3,434 million as a percentage of Total revenue of $48.6 billion at a consolidated level. SG&amp;A expense ratio on a GAAP basis for the second quarter 2022 represents enterprise selling, general and administrative expenses of $3,264 million as a percentage of Total revenue of $45.5 billion at a consolidated level.Adjusted SG&amp;A expense ratio for the second quarter 2023 represents enterprise selling, general and administrative expenses of $3,428 million excluding special items of $6 million as a percentage of adjusted revenue at a consolidated level. Adjusted SG&amp;A expense ratio for the second quarter 2022 represents enterprise selling, general and administrative expenses of $3,234 million excluding special items of $30 million as a percentage of adjusted revenue at a consolidated level.7.The measure ""adjusted effective tax rate"" is not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, ""consolidated effective tax rate"". We define adjusted effective tax rate as the consolidated income tax rate applicable to the Company's pre-tax income excluding pre-tax income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net realized investment results, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and special items. The Cigna Group's share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the Cigna Healthcare segment using the equity method of accounting are also excluded. Management is not able to provide a reconciliation to the consolidated effective tax rate on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, certain components thereof include (i) future net realized investment results and (ii) future special items.8.Customer relationships are defined as follows:Total medical customers includes individuals in the Cigna Healthcare segment who meet any one of the following criteria: are covered under a medical insurance policy, managed care arrangement, or service agreement issued by Cigna Healthcare; have access to Cigna Healthcare's provider network for covered services under their medical plan; or have medical claims and services that are administered by Cigna Healthcare.International Health medical customers excludes medical customers served by less than 100% owned subsidiaries, as well as certain customers served by our third-party administrator. International Health customers as of June 30, 2023 reflect the transition of certain runoff business to Other Operations beginning January 1, 2023.Effective January 1, 2023, total pharmacy customers have been updated to reflect customer filled prescriptions through Inside Rx. Previously these customers had been estimated based on active customers over a period of time. Total pharmacy customers for prior periods have been restated to reflect this change.Behavioral care and total customer relationships as of December 31, 2022 excluding the impact of the supplemental behavioral coverage contract with New York Life were 24,696 thousand and 157,876 thousand, respectively9.Adjusted margin, pre-tax, is calculated by dividing adjusted income (loss) from operations, pre-tax by adjusted revenues for each segment.10.The Cigna Group owns a 50% noncontrolling interest in its China joint venture. As such, the adjusted revenues for the Cigna Healthcare segment only include the Company's 50% share of the joint venture's earnings reported in Fees and Other Revenues using the equity method of accounting under GAAP.11.Medical costs payable within the Cigna Healthcare segment are presented net of reinsurance and other recoverables. The gross medical costs payable balance was $5.34 billion as of June 30, 2023, $4.18 billion as of December 31, 2022, and $4.49 billion as of June 30, 2022. CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release, and oral statements made in connection with this release, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

This compares to earnings of $1.36 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 19.74%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this mortgage insurer would post earnings of $0.76 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.98, delivering a surprise of 28.95%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Radian , which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, posted revenues of $278.85 million for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.55%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $301.42 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Radian shares have added about 41.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.2%.What's Next for Radian?While Radian has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Radian: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.77 on $296.5 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.28 on $1.16 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Insurance - Multi line is currently in the top 42% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Cigna (CI), has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on August 3.This health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.98 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3.9%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Cigna's revenues are expected to be $47.13 billion, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:ANSS) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for ANSYS Is ANSYS Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$783.5mUS$927.2mUS$1.11bUS$1.23bUS$1.32bUS$1.40bUS$1.47bUS$1.53bUS$1.58bUS$1.63bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 7.50%Est @ 5.89%Est @ 4.75%Est @ 3.96%Est @ 3.40%Est @ 3.02% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$725US$794US$877US$903US$898US$879US$852US$820US$784US$748(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.3bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.6b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.1%) = US$28bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$28b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$13bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$21b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$325, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at ANSYS as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.006. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for ANSYSStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessExpensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

(NASDAQ: ANSS), today reported second quarter 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP revenue growth of 5% and 4% in reported currency, respectively, or 6% and 5% in constant currency, respectively, when compared to the second quarter of 2022. For the second quarter of 2023, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $0.80 and $1.60 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively, compared to $1.13 and $1.77 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively, for the second quarter of 2022. Additionally, the Company reported second quarter ACV growth of 6% in reported currency, or 7% in constant currency, when compared to the second quarter of 2022.“Ansys delivered another outstanding quarter, once again beating financial guidance across all key metrics.

We recently released the latest version of our product portfolio, Ansys 2023 R2, which is empowering customers to expand the use of Ansys simulation in new and exciting ways. With our unrivaled product portfolio, broad and deep customer relationships, and strong execution, I am excited about our ability to achieve our short-term and long-term objectives,” said Ajei Gopal, Ansys president and CEO.Nicole Anasenes, Ansys CFO, stated, “Our second quarter results continue to demonstrate our robust and resilient business model. Q2 results exceeded the midpoint of our outlook shared in May, and contributed to strong year-to-date performance, reflecting ACV growth of 12% in constant currency and GAAP and non-GAAP revenue growth of 14% and 13% in constant currency, respectively. Our double-digit performance for the first half of 2023 puts us on track to deliver on our full-year commitments and keeps us on our long-term model trajectory. We continue to see momentum in the business, which gives us further confidence to raise our full year outlook for ACV and revenue guidance.”Story continues   The non-GAAP financial results highlighted, and the non-GAAP financial outlook for 2023 discussed below, represent non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the appropriate GAAP measures, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, and for the 2023 financial outlook, can be found later in this release.   / Financial ResultsAnsys' second quarter and year-to-date (YTD) 2023 and 2022 financial results are presented below. The 2023 and 2022 non-GAAP results exclude the income statement effects of stock-based compensation, excess payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, expenses related to business combinations and adjustments for the income tax effect of the excluded items. The 2022 period non-GAAP results also exclude the income statement effects of acquisition accounting adjustments to deferred revenue from business combinations closed prior to 2022. There is no adjustment in 2023 as the impact is not material.GAAP and non-GAAP results are as follows: GAAP Non-GAAP(in millions, except per share data and percentages)Q2 QTD 2023 Q2 QTD 2022 % Change Q2 QTD 2023 Q2 QTD 2022 % ChangeRevenue$496.6  $473.9  5% $496.6  $475.9  4%Net income$69.5  $98.8  (30)% $139.3  $154.6  (10)%Diluted earnings per share$0.80  $1.13  (29)% $1.60  $1.77  (10)%Operating profit margin 19.3%  27.0%    36.4%  40.7%   GAAP Non-GAAP(in millions, except per share data and percentages)Q2 YTD2023 Q2 YTD2022 % Change Q2 YTD2023 Q2 YTD2022 % ChangeRevenue$1,006.0  $898.9  12% $1,006.0  $904.5  11%Net income$170.1  $169.8  —% $301.1  $273.8  10%Diluted earnings per share$1.95  $1.94  1% $3.45  $3.13  10%Operating profit margin 22.2%  23.3%    38.1%  37.8%  / Other Performance Metrics(in millions, except percentages)Q2 QTD 2023 Q2 QTD 2022 % Change % Change in Constant CurrencyACV$488.3 $460.3 6% 7%Operating cash flows$62.9 $118.9 (47)%  Unlevered operating cash flows$72.1 $122.0 (41)%  (in millions, except percentages)Q2 YTD2023 Q2 YTD2022 % Change % Change in Constant CurrencyACV$887.8 $804.4 10% 12%Operating cash flows$323.6 $329.9 (2)%  Unlevered operating cash flows$341.7 $335.0 2%  ACV is a key performance metric and is useful to investors in assessing the strength and trajectory of our business. ACV is a supplemental metric to help evaluate the annual performance of the business. Over the life of the contract, ACV equals the total value realized from a customer. ACV is not impacted by the timing of license revenue recognition. ACV is used by management in financial and operational decision-making and in setting sales targets used for compensation. ACV is not a replacement for, and should be viewed independently of, GAAP revenue and deferred revenue as ACV is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. There is no GAAP measure comparable to ACV. ACV is composed of the following:the annualized value of maintenance and subscription lease contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plusthe value of perpetual license contracts with start dates during the period, plusthe annualized value of fixed-term services contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plusthe value of work performed during the period on fixed-deliverable services contracts.When we refer to the anniversary dates in the definition of ACV above, we are referencing the date of the beginning of the next twelve-month period in a contractually committed multi-year contract. If a contract is three years in duration, with a start date of July 1, 2023, the anniversary dates would be July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025. We label these anniversary dates as they are contractually committed. While this contract would be up for renewal on July 1, 2026, our ACV performance metric does not assume any contract renewals.Example 1: For purposes of calculating ACV, a $100,000 subscription lease contract or a $100,000 maintenance contract with a term of July 1, 2023 – June 30, 2024, would each contribute $100,000 to ACV for fiscal year 2023 with no contribution to ACV for fiscal year 2024.Example 2: For purposes of calculating ACV, a $300,000 subscription lease contract or a $300,000 maintenance contract with a term of July 1, 2023 – June 30, 2026, would each contribute $100,000 to ACV in each of fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025. There would be no contribution to ACV for fiscal year 2026 as each period captures the full annual value upon the anniversary date.Example 3: A perpetual license valued at $200,000 with a contract start date of March 1, 2023 would contribute $200,000 to ACV in fiscal year 2023./ Management's 2023 Financial OutlookThe Company's third quarter and updated FY 2023 revenue, diluted earnings per share and ACV guidance is provided below. The diluted earnings per share guidance is provided on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the income statement effects of stock-based compensation, excess payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, expenses related to business combinations and adjustments for the income tax effect of the excluded items.This guidance is based on the Company's evaluation of factual information it has determined to be relevant and the application of certain assumptions made by the Company. Please refer to the Company's prepared remarks document for additional information regarding the Company's financial guidance, including its assumptions regarding overall business dynamics./ Third Quarter 2023 Guidance The Company currently expects the following for the quarter ending September 30, 2023:(in millions, except percentages and per share data)GAAP Non-GAAPRevenue$453.7-$473.7 $453.7-$473.7 Revenue Growth Rate(4.0%)-0.3% (4.2%)-0.0% Revenue Growth Rate — Constant Currency(5.3%)-(1.2%) (5.6%)-(1.4%)Diluted earnings per share$0.46-$0.64 $1.18-$1.31(in millions, except percentages)Other Financial MetricsACV$460.5-$480.5 ACV Growth Rate12.5%-17.4% ACV Growth Rate — Constant Currency10.5%-15.3%Quarterly dynamics can be volatile and oftentimes, variances in the income statement can be disconnected from ACV. The quarterly mix of license types that generate up-front revenue recognition creates a year-over-year revenue headwind in the third quarter which is causing the income statement to be disconnected from the accelerating third quarter and second half ACV outlook. The year-over-year revenue and resulting income statement in the third quarter is not a reflection of business momentum. Our full-year raised ACV guidance continues to be the best metric to observe the momentum in our business./ Fiscal Year 2023 GuidanceThe Company currently expects the following for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023:(in millions, except percentages and per share data)GAAP Non-GAAPRevenue$2,257.0-$2,327.0 $2,257.0-$2,327.0 Revenue Growth Rate9.3%-12.7% 8.9%-12.3% Revenue Growth Rate — Constant Currency8.9%-12.2% 8.5%-11.9%Diluted earnings per share$5.32-$5.95 $8.39-$8.88(in millions, except percentages)Other Financial MetricsACV$2,275.0-$2,340.0 ACV Growth Rate12.0%-15.2% ACV Growth Rate — Constant Currency11.4%-14.6%Unlevered operating cash flows$699.0-$749.0Our FY 2023 guidance is inclusive of $47.5 million in interest expense. This compares to interest expense in FY 2022 of $22.7 million with the significant increase in FY 2023 driven by the interest rate environment and our floating interest rate on our term loan. Reconciliations of the GAAP to Non-GAAP diluted EPS outlook and the operating cash flow to unlevered operating cash flow outlook are available in our ""Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures"" section found later in this document.Relative to our May guidance, our updated full-year non-GAAP diluted EPS contemplates $0.04 of operational improvement at the midpoint from increased full-year revenue guidance, which was more than offset by $0.06 of higher interest expense and one-time items in other expense./ Conference Call InformationAnsys will hold a conference call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on August 3, 2023 to discuss second quarter results.

These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. A detailed explanation of each of the adjustments to such financial measures is described below. This press release also contains a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure.We use non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to our competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (e) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and (f) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and employees. In addition, many financial analysts that follow us focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that it is in the best interest of our investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-GAAP financial information. Moreover, investors have historically requested, and we have historically reported, these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all our competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of our competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:Acquisition accounting for deferred revenue. Historically, we have consummated acquisitions in order to support our strategic and other business objectives. Under prior accounting guidance, a fair value provision resulted in acquired deferred revenue that was often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that was lower than the historical carrying value. Although this fair value provision has no impact on our business or cash flow, it adversely impacts our reported GAAP revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. In 2022, we adopted accounting guidance which eliminates the fair value provision that resulted in the deferred revenue adjustment on a prospective basis. In order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, we have historically provided non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment for acquisitions prior to the adoption of the new guidance in 2022. The 2022 non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document include the adjustment to exclude the income statement effects of acquisition accounting adjustments to deferred revenue from business combinations closed prior to 2022. There is no adjustment included for 2023 as the impact is not material.Amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions. We incur amortization of intangible assets, included in our GAAP presentation of amortization expense, related to various acquisitions we have made. We exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by us after the acquisition. Accordingly, we do not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating our performance during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and we exclude such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our past reports of financial results as we have historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures.Stock-based compensation expense. We incur expense related to stock-based compensation included in our GAAP presentation of cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense; and selling, general and administrative expense. This non-GAAP adjustment also includes excess payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation. Although stock-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, we exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance. Specifically, we exclude stock-based compensation during our annual budgeting process and our quarterly and annual assessments of our performance. The annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby we allocate resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. Additionally, the annual review by our board of directors during which it compares our historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stock-based compensation. In evaluating the performance of our senior management and department managers, charges related to stock-based compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results. In fact, we record stock-based compensation expense into a stand-alone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable. In this way, we can review, on a period-to-period basis, each manager's performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stock-based compensation. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.Expenses related to business combinations. We incur expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in our GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative expense. We also incur other expenses directly related to business combinations, including compensation expenses and concurrent restructuring activities, such as employee severances and other exit costs. These costs are included in our GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses. We exclude these acquisition-related expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance, as we generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of our operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.Non-GAAP tax provision. We utilize a normalized non-GAAP annual effective tax rate (AETR) to calculate non-GAAP measures. This methodology provides better consistency across interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring items and aligning the non-GAAP tax rate with our expected geographic earnings mix. To project this rate, we analyzed our historic and projected non-GAAP earnings mix by geography along with other factors such as our current tax structure, recurring tax credits and incentives, and expected tax positions. On an annual basis we re-evaluate and update this rate for significant items that may materially affect our projections.Unlevered operating cash flows. We make cash payments for the interest incurred in connection with our debt financing which are included in our GAAP presentation of operating cash flows. We exclude this cash paid for interest, net of the associated tax benefit, for the purpose of calculating unlevered operating cash flows. Unlevered operating cash flow is a supplemental non-GAAP measure that we use to evaluate our core operating business. We believe this measure is useful to investors and management because it provides a measure of our cash generated through operating activities independent of the capital structure of the business.Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as listed below:GAAP Reporting MeasureNon-GAAP Reporting MeasureRevenueNon-GAAP RevenueGross ProfitNon-GAAP Gross ProfitGross Profit MarginNon-GAAP Gross Profit MarginOperating IncomeNon-GAAP Operating IncomeOperating Profit MarginNon-GAAP Operating Profit MarginNet IncomeNon-GAAP Net IncomeDiluted Earnings Per ShareNon-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per ShareOperating Cash FlowsUnlevered Operating Cash FlowsConstant currency. In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures detailed above, we use constant currency results for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. To present this information, the 2023 results for entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. Dollar were converted to U.S. Dollars at rates that were in effect for the 2022 comparable period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect for 2023. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by adjusting the 2023 reported amounts by the 2023 currency fluctuation impacts and comparing the adjusted amounts to the 2022 comparable period reported amounts. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our reported results to our past reports of financial results without the effects of foreign currency fluctuations./ About AnsysWhen visionary companies need to know how their world-changing ideas will perform, they close the gap between design and reality with Ansys simulation.

It returned $117 million to shareholders through dividend payouts in the fiscal first quarter. The company declared a quarterly cash dividend of 30 cents per share, to be paid out on Sep 20, 2023, to shareholders of record as of Sep 11.OutlookManagement reiterated earnings view for the current fiscal year. For fiscal 2024, the company anticipates revenues to be modestly down to flat year over year, driven by the persistent weakness in its wholesale business and a longer-than-expected turnaround for Vans. The company’s wholesale business, mainly in the U.S., remains challenging as its major partners are having a more cautious approach on forward orders. Vans performance is also concerning.However, the North Face and China business have been experiencing momentum. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is also seeing an improved performance in the supply chain, allowing it to capitalize on revenue opportunities. It has also been managing costs and inventory position. Overall, management expects a better second-half revenue performance with respect to the first half on improving wholesale performance, moderating declines at Vans and easing year-over-year comparisons.For fiscal 2024, the bottom line is envisioned to be $2.05-$2.25 per share. It anticipates free cash flow to be about $900 million.Key PicksSome better-ranked companies are Royal Caribbean RCL, lululemon athletica LULU and Ralph Lauren RL.Royal Caribbean sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to Allegra Perry, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin.Allegra Perry: Good afternoon, and welcome to VF Corporation's first quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. Participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC. Unless otherwise noted, amounts referred to on today's call will be on an adjusted constant dollar basis, which we've defined in the press release that was issued this afternoon, and which we use as lead numbers in our discussions, because we believe they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to adjusted amounts can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management's view of why this information is useful to investors. Joining me will be VF's President and Chief Executive Officer, Bracken Darrell; and EVP and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Puckett. Matt will then host the question-and-answer session and will be joined by several VF executives. I'll now hand over to Bracken.Story continuesBracken Darrell: Hello, everyone. I'm happy to join my first conference call with VF as CEO. While my role today will be a little bit more limited then what I'm used to, given I'm on my 12th day here, I am super excited to be here. VF's portfolio of globally powerful and iconic brands, deeply embedded purpose and impressive talent, all give me a lot of confidence. These are the key ingredients needed to unlock the company's significant value potential and return to strong, sustainable and profitable growth. I joined VF after 10 years as CEO of Logitech, where I'm proud to have overseen a transformation of the company that grew its value tenfold. We did it by putting the customer at the center of everything we do. I'm passionate about building brands through a design and innovation focus.With unique products and immersive storytelling, consumer experience is elevated and so is growth. While, I'm just roughly 10 days in, I already feel at home here. I've spent time in our offices in Denver meeting with our brands based here and with many, many VF associates. I visited our European team in Stabio and I'll be in Costa Mesa at the Vans offices tomorrow morning. I've been in our stores in Denver, San Francisco, New York, London and more cities. I've been in three of our Supreme stores around the world and many Vans and North Face stores. I talk to customers everywhere I go and I started to dig into the brand equity data. My conclusion is that our brands are as strong as I expected. Our team is loaded with talent. Our business is simply not performing at the level equal those, but it's because of things in our control.I feel a strong sense of urgency with respect to the challenges we face, and we'll collectively work with the team to get VF back on track through disciplined and thoughtful actions. I'm looking forward to speaking with all of you again at our Q2 earnings results to share my perspectives on my first few months in the role. This company has what it takes and I'm excited about the future of the VF and its ability to return to delivering strong shareholder returns. I'll now turn it over to Matt to talk you through the quarter.Matt Puckett: Thank you, Bracken, and welcome to VF. Your impressive track record and strong background and innovation and design brings a new dimension to leading VF and reinforces my confidence as we turn the page to our next dynamic chapter. I also wanted to extend our gratitude to Benno, who's been instrumental in laying a solid foundation for VF's return to strong, sustainable and profitable growth. We are refocusing our efforts toward the consumer and by taking aggressive actions to strengthen the business operationally and financially and personally a great partner to me. We are fortunate to have him continuing as a valued member of the VF Board. I'm more confident than ever that with Bracken as our new leader VF has everything it takes to succeed in the future.Before I get into the business and financial results, let me give you an update on our two most important near-term priorities that we've been highlighting in recent quarters. The supply chain and Vans. First, in the supply chain, where we saw further progress during the quarter as industry conditions continued to improve and our own actions to address execution yielded results. Lead times into the quarter at normalized levels, while our on-time performance and in-stock percentages were both back in line with our targets. We are appreciative of the quick and aggressive actions taken by the supply chain and brand teams to position us to now consistently meet our customers' expectations and maximize on the opportunities that present themselves in season.Next, Vans, which was down 22% in the quarter and was disproportionately impacted by the brand's wholesale business in the Americas, which was down 40% as anticipated. This includes intentional actions we've taken to right size inventory in advance of the important back-to-school season. We were encouraged by the results in China and in the digital business, which have both meaningfully improved relative to the prior quarter's trend versus last year. While the brand's overall performance was largely anticipated, it's not where we should be and we remain intently focused on the actions to turn around the brand. Now an update on the key focus areas of product, consumer and go-to-market. First and foremost, product. We're increasing our level of investments to create new relevant product that excites consumers while developing existing franchises that are working well.UltraRange and MTE silhouettes continue to outperform growing 13% and 39% in the quarter respectively with newer line including new school and Lowlands, all generating strong sales growth. The soft launch of the Pinnacle range OTW during Paris Fashion Week in June, created excitement and energy laying the groundwork for the full launch in early 2024. Another key focus area we've shared previously is an opportunity to better understand and integrate the consumer into our decision making. Our significant global segmentation refresh is on track and in the meantime, our bands family membership keeps growing, now approaching 29 million members, adding one million members in Q1 and more than doubling in two years. We continue to improve the Vans go-to-market activities.Our initiatives to sharpen our focus around fewer key products and stores are well underway and are benefiting the quality and productivity of our store assortments with our in-store skew reduction actions expected to be fully completed in August. We'll also be launching our redesigned vans.com platform in time for the holiday season. Vans is a great brand and we're confident in its enduring strength and importantly, the energy and intensity that this leadership team is bringing to the effort every day. Now turning to a review of the quarter. Q1, our smallest quarter and facing the toughest prior year compare came in line with our expectations, both on the top and bottom lines. That said, overall our performance was not up to the standard we expect to achieve.Revenue was down 8% in line with guidance and wholesale particularly pressured the top line in the U.S. On a two-year basis, revenue was about flat. Let me first unpack the performance by region. Revenue in the Americas region was down 15% in the quarter, primarily due to the wholesale channel pressures we outlined in May. These had an impact across most of the portfolio and in particular they Vans and Dickies. The quarter's results were impacted by the right sizing of inventories across the channel and the implications of our poor customer service from last fall. Our business in EMEA, which as you know has grown consistently and strongly, also saw softer trends in the quarter with revenue in the region down 3% in Q1, driven by high single digit decline in wholesale as retailers grew more cautious.Our direct-to-consumer business was up mid-single digits in the quarter, a sign of resilient consumer demand for our brand and evidence of our continued strong execution of integrated go-to-market strategies. Last, we continue to see growing momentum in the APAC region with revenue up 18%. All channels grew by double digits in the region with deep [indiscernible] fueled by brick and mortar traffic growth. Greater China saw further acceleration of 31% and benefited from the comparison to the prior year lockdown impacts. The North Face continues to be the key driver of our performance and was up more than 50% in Greater China, benefiting from outdoor market tailwinds and recovering domestic travel. Now let me complete the picture of the brand's performance starting with The North Face, where revenue was up 12% in the quarter against a tough prior year compare plus 37% and driven by broad based growth across products, channels and regions.Globally high demand for our icons, as an example, the Basecamp duffle as well as the Voyager Packs [ph] line generated very strong performance aided by the summer travel season. Our lifestyle product, the urban exploration line and our rain wear also saw good momentum. Growth was led by DTC, driven by digital, as the brand's product innovation and sharp execution resonated with consumers. Number one was down 6% in the quarter, in line with our expectations. The brand was up against the tougher prior year compare and results were impacted by wholesale in the Americas as partners continued to reduce inventory levels. Results were positive in the other two regions. Globally, product innovation is resonating as the new hiking silhouette Motion 6 delivered outsized sell through performance and we made good progress on women's, with strong growth in sandals and apparel for her.Dickies results were disappointing and significantly challenged during the quarter, down 19%, as the work segment continues to be impacted by a weaker value and consumer, primarily in the U.S. Soft results in the Americas and APAC were partially offset by continued growth in Europe. Importantly, we have made progress on rightsizing inventory levels in the channel. Moving down the P&amp;L, Q1 gross margin was down 130 basis points. As expected, business mix remained a positive contributor to margin in the quarter, up 80 basis points, driven primarily by DTC and international growth. Rate was down to 200 basis points, more than offsetting mix benefits, reflecting the ongoing impact of higher promotions. Where it's worth noting the negative impact is about one third of what it was over the previous two quarters and higher product costs which are moderating and which were partially offset by strategic pricing actions and finally, negative currency impacts.Apparel, ClothesPhoto by Ian Deng Quddu on UnsplashAdjusted operating margin was down 380 basis points, reflecting the impact of the lower gross margins and SG&amp;A deleverage. SG&amp;A declined versus last year by 3% in constant dollars, which exhibits our focus on reducing costs and managing the P&amp;L in times when the revenue line is under pressure. SG&amp;A deleveraged 250 basis points in the quarter reflecting DTC and other fixed cost deleverage in addition to the impact of continued strategic investments in technology, marketing and distribution. Q1 loss per share was $0.15, also impacted by elevated interest expense and a modestly negative impact from tax. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, I'll start with inventory, where we saw further sequential progress in improving the overall health of our inventory position, ending the quarter slightly ahead of our plan with inventories up 19% versus last year, compared to organic growth of about 46% at the end of the fiscal year and up 75% the quarter before that.The increase in inventory now represents a true organic comparison as we fully lap the impact of the supply chain financing program implemented in Q1 of fiscal 2023. Inventory composition remains primarily core carryover and replenishment, which has a higher likelihood of being sold at full price or with a minimal markdown. Cash from operations, which as a reminder is also benefiting from the extension of payment terms as part of the supply chain financing program, was 164,000,000 in the quarter. We know the quarter was roughly $3 billion in liquidity in line with our plan and about flat to the end of the fiscal year. The free cash flow of $79 million in essence offset by the dividend payments of $117 million. As it relates to the outlook, before I unpack the numbers, let me give you a little context for how we see the balance of the year evolving.We see several areas of strength worth calling out which give us confidence as we look forward. The North Face is maintaining strong momentum and we expect this to continue with investments being made to further fuel this growth. Our China business is gaining momentum and we believe our brands have significant growth opportunities in this market where we are under penetrated. Certainly the outdoor and travel part of the market continues to be strong and The North Face as the number one international outdoor brand in China is driving and benefiting from that trend. Our DTC trends AMEA remained strong and in fact comp growth has accelerated in June and July. Finally, we are seeing an improved performance in the supply chain, which will allow us to deliver the planned cash flow benefit from reducing inventories and capitalize on revenue opportunities as they present themselves through the balance of the year.However, we continue to face a few meaningful headwinds. Vans performance remains difficult as work to turn around the brand continues with a great deal of urgency. Our wholesale business, particularly in the U.S., remains challenging as our key partners maintain a more cautious stance on forward orders. And the work segment of the Dickies business has remained softer for longer than we anticipated. It's still early in the year and our teams across the business are working diligently to maximize the opportunities our brands have to deliver compelling experiences and products to consumers across channels. And we have great confidence that we'll see progressively improving results. Now moving on to the specifics of our updated outlook, we are revising our full year revenue expectations to be modestly down to flat as we take a more conservative posture on the balance of the year.The reason for the change in revenue outlook is based primarily on wholesale. Despite the progress made in lowering inventory levels, our wholesale business remains pressured, while our sellout transfer evolving favorably in the outdoor segment In particular, selling is challenged across the segment.GSV: Overall for VF, we continue to expect a better second-half revenue performance relative to the first half, reflecting an improving wholesale performance, moderating declines at Vans and easing prior year compares as we move to the back part of the year considering the challenges we faced last year and our own poor execution, which muted our performance. We are maintaining our EPS guidance range of $2.00 and five to $2.25 for the year. As a reminder, this includes a higher level of interest and a higher tax rate. Worth highlighting, the underlying operating earnings are anticipated to grow faster than EPS. We achieved our earnings target in Q1 and highlight that we have a number of levers across margins and spending to protect profitability.We continue to appropriately manage our costs and inventory position in order to protect the P&amp;L and the balance sheet. We're increasingly confident in our ability to deliver higher gross margins. The year ago period will benefit from moderating promotions as we lapped last year's impacts, clearer visibility to easing product costs including freight and increasingly favorable mix reflecting the outperformance and strength of our DTC and international businesses. This guidance takes into account our continued commitment to first investing in key capabilities where we continue to see opportunities to fuel organic growth and focused on areas that create value for our customers and consumers. Let me give you some examples. Product innovation and domain creation at The North Face with a higher spend as a percent of revenue; the opening of the Ontario California distribution center, our most highly automated facility that will allow us to more efficiently service orders and which will generate cost savings over time at full scale; the enhancement of our consumer facing digital ecosystem with the launch of an updated digital platform in the U.S. to which most of our brands have now migrated.Second, we continue to reduce cost aggressively if it's not adding value for the consumer. And some examples here include; stopping technology spending that is not consumer facing or impacting; aggressively optimizing our distribution capacity, considering reduced unit sales volumes; and pausing discretionary spending. As an example, open roles that are not critical to revenue driving activities and brand building strategies. Now let me give you a couple of updates from the drivers of cash flow. We continue to expect free cash flow in line with our plan, driven both by growth in cash earnings and a reduction in working capital, primarily from activities to reduce inventory levels and recognizing the full benefit of revised payment terms with our product suppliers as we migrate through fiscal year 2024.Importantly, we expect inventory to be near to normalized levels by the end of this calendar year and down at least 10% year-over-year at the end of the fiscal year, which would equate to a reduction of about $250 million. We maintain tight control and discipline on all capital spending and in light of business conditions, we've paused lower priority projects. Moving on to debt, we remain laser focused on reducing our leverage. We have ample liquidity and financial flexibility to pursue our key priorities. Our number one financial objective is to return VF to our historical balance sheet strength. Accordingly, we will use any excess free cash flow to reduce debt and you can be sure that any strategic decision we are making is through this lens.We expect to end this fiscal year with gross leverage of about four times, and we'll continue to make progress on the path to moving toward our target of 2.5 times. Now, you may have noticed I haven't talked a lot about the macro environment in my comments. We remain intently focused on our own issues and on what we can control, and so much of what we have to do relies on fixing those issues. At the same time, we're not oblivious to the external conditions and they do inform our near-term tactics and strategies. The environment itself remains difficult and volatile. We recognize that many consumers are feeling impacts to their disposable income and are continuing to deal with inflation facing higher interest rates and in the U.S. the upcoming into the student loan pulse.In summary, for fiscal year 2024, we are slightly more cautious on the evolution of revenue, but remained confident we will deliver increasing operating earnings to improve gross margins and strong cash flow, together enabling us to achieve our debt reduction targets, all leading to a strength in financial position. Finally, I'll give you an update on the Timberland Travel Case. The latest development being that oral arguments occurred last week, which was sooner than we anticipated. This advanced timeline indicates the First Circuit Appeals Court could issue an opinion as early as the next few months. We previously expected this vision could occur within this fiscal year and in light of the pace at which the oral arguments proceeded, it's now increasingly evident that this will be the case.We continue to believe the timing and treatment of the income inclusion at issue is appropriate. Looking ahead to the future, we are confident that we have all the right ingredients to succeed and to return to our standard of delivering superior shareholder returns driven by strong, sustainable and profitable growth. We have a portfolio of world renowned and beloved brands which are well positioned in big and growing spaces that continue to benefit from macro consumer tailwinds. We've taken significant actions to strengthen our business operationally and financially. I'm confident these initiatives will yield tangible benefits. We continue to work to drive improved product margins including better go-to-market efficiencies, product cost optimization and strategic pricing actions.These near and medium term actions, combined with the ongoing focus to drive down costs which are not consumer facing, will support an expanding margin profile over time. We remain committed to our purpose, which is at the heart of everything we do, will continue to remain central to our culture and to our strategy. Our team of passionate, highly skilled and deeply committed associates continues to be a key asset to unlocking our full potential. In closing, we can and we will better harness the power and strength of VF, while continuing to focus on sharpening execution, optimizing earnings and cash flow and strengthening the balance sheet. All of which will enable VF to begin to fulfill its full potential this year and beyond. With that, we'll now be joined by several members of the team to answer your questions.Martino Scabbia Guerrini, who run our business in AMEA and APAC and in the emerging brands and our brand leaders from Vans and North Face, Timberland, Supreme.

This was slightly weaker than the 12 cent loss Wall Street analysts projected, according to FactSet. Revenues were down 8 percent to $2.1 billion, in line with expectations.More from Footwear NewsSteve Madden Stock Dips After Wholesale Challenges Persist in Q2After a Strong Q2, Skechers Is 'Cautiously Optimistic' That US Wholesale Is on the UpswingFor Vans, business was down 22 percent, largely from a 40 percent dip in the Americas wholesale business. The drop came after multiple quarters of sales and profit declines for Vans. In Q4, Vans revenues slid 14 percent to $857 million. Vans also dropped 13 percent to $926.9 million in sales in the third quarter.Moving forward, rightsizing Vans is a top priority for VF. As Vans global brand president Kevin Bailey told told FN in an interview in March, “The brand is not broken.” At the time, he identified several missteps, including not innovating enough, becoming dependent on classics and becoming less strategic about where the brand shows up in the marketplace.These problems have persisted.“We became over-reliant on classics and particularly on really just a couple of styles, and that really was a big piece of our underperformance, and we didn’t have a strong product pipeline behind it,” Bailey said in call with analysts on Tuesday. He believes opportunity for growth can come from leaning into franchises outside of classics, such as the UltraRange and MTE lines, both of which saw double-digit growth in the quarter.New introductions, such as the Knu Skool, like the Lowland, like the Mary Jane, are also performing well, he added, but are not strong enough to offset wider losses in classics. Vans also recently soft launched a new pinnacle category, OTW by Vans, which will come fully into the market in the spring.Story continuesIn U.S. stores, Vans will reduce the number of SKUs by between 20 and 30 percent in its U.S. stores and changing the layouts of the stores.Moving forward, VF expects Vans to return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year. In China, the brand is already seeing some growth, with Q1 growth in the high single digits. But leadership won’t take any shortcuts to get back on track across all regions.“We’re not looking for a quick fix in this business,” said EVP and CFO Matt Puckett. “We’re setting up the brand for long-term profitable growth, and we’re not going to sacrifice that objective. I think that’s really important. And it’s taking longer than we would have liked.”Best of Footwear NewsA History of Forever 21: From Humble Beginnings to Bankruptcy and the Shaquille O'Neal BouncebackFootwear Company CEOs You Should KnowList of Footwear Company CEOs You Should Know]"

I'm happy to join my first conference call with VF as CEO. While my role today will be a little more limited than what I'm used to, given I'm on my 12th day here, I am super excited to be here. VF's portfolio of globally powerful and iconic brands, deeply embedded purpose and impressive talent all give me a lot of confidence. These are the key ingredients needed to unlock the company's significant value potential and return to strong, sustainable and profitable growth.I joined VF after 10 years as CEO of Logitech, where I'm proud to have overseen the transformation of the company that grew its value tenfold. We did it by putting the customer at the center of everything we do. I'm passionate about building brands through a design and innovation focus. With unique products and immersive storytelling, consumer experience is elevated and so is growth.While I'm just roughly 10 days in, I already feel at home here. I've spent time in our offices in Denver, meeting with our brands based here and with many, many VF associates. I visited our European team in Stabio, and I'll be in Costa Mesa at the Vans offices tomorrow morning. I've been in our stores in Denver, San Francisco, New York, London and more cities. I've been in 3 of our Supreme stores around the world and many Vans and North Face stores. I talk to customers everywhere I go, and I started to dig into the brand equity data.My conclusion is that our brands are as strong as I expected. Our team is loaded with talent. Our business is simply not performing at the level equal to those, but it's because of things in our control. I feel a strong sense of urgency with respect to the challenges that we face and will collectively work with the team to get VF back on track through disciplined and thoughtful actions. I'm looking forward to speaking with all of you again at our Q2 earnings results to share my perspectives on my first few months in the role. This company has what it takes, and I'm excited about the future of VF and its ability to return to delivering strong shareholder returns.I'll now turn it over to Matt to talk you through the quarter.Matthew H. PuckettThank you, Bracken, and welcome to VF. Your impressive track record and strong background in innovation and design brings a new dimension to leading VF and reinforces my confidence as we turn the page to our next dynamic chapter. I also wanted to extend our gratitude to Benno, who's been instrumental in laying a solid foundation for VF's return to strong, sustainable and profitable growth by refocusing our efforts towards the consumer and by taking aggressive actions to strengthen the business operationally and financially, and personally, a great partner to me. We are fortunate to have him continuing as a valued member of the VF Board. I'm more confident than ever that with Bracken as our new leader, VF has everything it takes to succeed in the future.Before I get into the business and financial results, let me give you an update on our 2 most important near-term priorities that we've been highlighting in recent quarters: the supply chain and Vans. First, in the supply chain, where we saw further progress during the quarter as industry conditions continued to improve and our own actions to address execution yielded results. Lead times ended the quarter at normalized levels, while our on-time performance and in-stock percentages were both back in line with our targets. We are appreciative of the quick and aggressive actions taken by the supply chain and brand teams to position us to now consistently meet our customers' expectations and maximize on the opportunities that present themselves in season.Next, Vans, which was down 22% in the quarter and was disproportionately impacted by the brand's wholesale business in the Americas, which was down 40% as anticipated. This includes intentional actions we've taken to rightsize inventories in advance of the important back-to-school season. We were encouraged by the results in China and in the digital business, which have both meaningfully improved relative to the prior quarter's trend versus last year. While the brand's overall performance was largely anticipated, it's not where we should be, and we remain intently focused on the actions to turn around the brand.Now an update on the key focus areas of product, consumer and go-to-market. First and foremost, product. We're increasing our level of investments to create new relevant products that excite consumers while developing existing franchise that are working well. UltraRange and MTE silhouettes continue to outperform, growing 13% and 39% in the quarter, respectively, with newer lines, including Knu Skool and Lowland all generating strong sell-throughs. The soft launch of the pinnacle range, OTW, during Paris Fashion Week in June created excitement and energy, laying the groundwork for the full launch in early 2024.Another key focus area we've shared previously is an opportunity to better understand and integrate the consumer into our decision-making. Our significant global segmentation refresh is on track. And in the meantime, our Vans Family membership keeps growing, now approaching 29 million members, adding 1 million members in Q1 and more than doubling in 2 years.We continue to improve the Vans go-to-market activities. Our initiative to sharpen our focus around fewer key products and stories are well underway and are benefiting the quality and productivity of our store assortment, with our in-store SKU reduction actions expected to be fully completed in August. We'll also be launching our redesigned vans.com platform in time for the holiday season.Vans is a great brand, and we're confident in its enduring strength and importantly, the energy and intensity that this leadership team is bringing to the effort every day.Now turning to a review of the quarter.

Greater China saw further acceleration of 31% and benefited from the comparison to the prior year lockdown impacts.

Globally, product innovation is resonating as the new hiking silhouette, Motion 6, delivered outsized sell-through performance, and we made good progress on women's with strong growth in sandals and apparel for her.Dickies' results were disappointing and significantly challenged during the quarter, down 19%, as the Work segment continues to be impacted by a weaker value in consumer, primarily in the U.S. Soft results in the Americas and APAC were partially offset by continued growth in Europe.

Rate was down 200 basis points, more than offsetting mix benefits, reflecting the ongoing impact of higher promotions. It's worth noting the negative impact is about 1/3 of what it was over the previous 2 quarters; also, higher product costs, which are moderating and which were partially offset by strategic pricing actions; and finally, negative currency impacts. Adjusted operating margin was down 380 basis points, reflecting the impact of the lower gross margin and SG&amp;A deleverage.SG&amp;A declined versus last year by 3% in constant dollars, which exhibits our focus on reducing costs and managing the P&amp;L in times when the revenue line is under pressure. SG&amp;A deleveraged 250 basis points in the quarter, reflecting DTC and other fixed cost deleverage in addition to the impact of continued strategic investments in technology, marketing and distribution. Q1 loss per share was $0.15, also impacted by elevated interest expense and a modestly negative impact from tax.Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. I'll start with inventory, where we saw further sequential progress in improving the overall health of our inventory position, ending the quarter slightly ahead of our plan, with inventories up 19% versus last year compared to organic growth of up 46% at the end of the fiscal year and up 75% the quarter before that. The increase in inventory now represents a true organic comparison as we fully lap the impact of the supply chain financing program implemented in Q1 of fiscal '23. Inventory composition remains primarily core, carryover and replenishment, which has a higher likelihood of being sold at full price or with a minimal markdown.Cash from operations, which, as a reminder, is also benefiting from the extension of payment terms as part of the supply chain financing program, was $164 million in the quarter. We knew the quarter was roughly $3 billion in liquidity, in line with our plan and about flat to the end of the fiscal year, with free cash flow of $79 million, in essence offset by the dividend payment of $117 million.As it relates to the outlook, before I unpack the numbers, let me give you a little context for how we see the balance of the year evolving. We see several areas of strength worth calling out, which gives us confidence as we look forward. The North Face is maintaining strong momentum, and we expect this to continue with investments being made to further fuel this growth. Our China business is gaining momentum, and we believe our brands have significant growth opportunities in this market where we are underpenetrated.Certainly, the outdoor and travel part of the market continues to be strong, and The North Face, as the #1 international outdoor brand in China, is driving and benefiting from that trend. Our DTC trends in EMEA remain strong, and in fact, comp growth has accelerated in June and July. Finally, we are seeing an improved performance in the supply chain, which will allow us to deliver the planned cash flow benefit from reducing inventories and capitalize on revenue opportunities as they present themselves through the balance of the year.However, we continue to face a few meaningful headwinds. Vans performance remains difficult as work to turn around the brand continues with a great deal of urgency. Our wholesale business, particularly in the U.S., remains challenging as our key partners maintain a more cautious stance on forward orders. And the Work segment of the Dickies business has remained softer for longer than we anticipated.It's still early in the year and our teams across the business are working diligently to maximize the opportunities our brands have to deliver compelling experiences and products to consumers across channels. And we have great confidence that we'll see progressively improving results.Now moving on to the specifics of our updated outlook. We are revising our full year revenue expectations to be modestly down to flat as we take a more conservative posture on the balance of the year. The reason for the change in revenue outlook is based primarily on wholesale. Despite the progress made in lowering inventory levels, our wholesale business remains pressured. While our sell-out trends are evolving favorably in the Outdoor segment in particular, sell-in is challenged across the segments. Through the balance of the year, our order books have evolved a little more muted than previously anticipated in both the U.S. and Europe and reflect the continued cautious posture by many of our partners. This has affected brands across the portfolio and (inaudible) disproportionately to Vans.As a result, we now expect wholesale across VF to be down mid- to high single digits for the year, with most of that pressure coming in our Americas business and, to a lesser extent, in Europe. Alongside this, however, we are encouraged by the trends in our DTC business, and we continue to expect growth in this channel during the year, including in the U.S.Overall, for VF, we continue to expect a better second half revenue performance relative to the first half, reflecting an improving wholesale performance, moderating declines at Vans and easing prior year compares as we move to the back part of the year, considering the challenges we faced last year and our own core execution, which muted our performance.We are maintaining our EPS guidance range of $2.05 to $2.25 for the year. As a reminder, this includes a higher level of interest and a higher tax rate. It's worth highlighting that the underlying operating earnings are anticipated to grow faster than EPS.We achieved our earnings target in Q1 and highlight that we have a number of levers across margins and spending to protect profitability. We continue to appropriately manage our cost and inventory position in order to protect the P&amp;L and the balance sheet. We are increasingly confident in our ability to deliver higher gross margins. The year-to-go period will benefit from moderating promotions as we lapped last year's impacts; clearer visibility to easing product costs, including freight; and increasingly favorable mix, reflecting the outperformance and strength of our DTC and international businesses.This guidance takes into account our continued commitment to, first, investing in key capabilities where we continue to see opportunities to fuel organic growth and focus on areas that create value for our customers and consumers. Let me give you some examples: product innovation and demand creation at The North Face with a higher spend as a percent of revenue; the opening of the Ontario, California distribution center, our most highly automated facility that will allow us to more efficiently service orders and which will generate cost savings over time at full scale; the enhancement of our consumer-facing digital ecosystem with the launch of an updated digital platform in the U.S. to which most of our brands have now migrated.Second, we continue to reduce costs aggressively where it's not adding value for the consumer. And some examples here include: stopping technology spending that is not consumer-facing or impacting; aggressively optimizing our distribution capacity considering reduced unit sales volumes; and pausing discretionary spending, as an example, open roles that are not critical to revenue-driving activities and brand building strategies.Now let me give you a couple of updates on the drivers of cash flow. We continue to expect free cash flow in line with our plan, driven both by growth in cash earnings and a reduction in working capital, primarily from activities to reduce inventory levels and recognizing the full benefit of revised payment terms with our product suppliers as we migrate through fiscal year '24. Importantly, we expect inventory to be near to normalized levels by the end of this calendar year and down at least 10% year-over-year at the end of the fiscal year, which would equate to a reduction of about $250 million. We maintained tight control and discipline on all capital spending. And in light of business conditions, we paused lower priority projects.Moving on to debt. We remain laser-focused on reducing our leverage. While we have ample liquidity and financial flexibility to pursue our key priorities, our #1 financial objective is to return VF to our historical balance sheet strength. Accordingly, we will use any excess free cash flow to reduce debt. You can be sure that any strategic decision we are making is through this plan. We expect to end this fiscal year with gross leverage of about 4x, and we'll continue to make progress on the path to moving toward our target of 2.5x.Now you may have noticed I haven't talked a lot about the macro environment in my comments. We remain intently focused on our own issues and on what we can control. And so much of what we have to do relies on fixing those issues. At the same time, we're not oblivious to the external conditions, and they do inform our near-term tactics and strategies.The environment itself remains difficult and volatile. We recognize that many consumers are feeling impacts to their disposable income and are continuing to deal with inflation, facing higher interest rates and in the U.S., the upcoming end to the student loan calls.In summary, for fiscal year '24, we are slightly more cautious on the evolution of revenue but remain confident we will deliver increasing operating earnings to improve gross margins and strong cash flow, together enabling us to achieve our debt reduction targets, all leading to a strengthened financial position.Finally, I'll give you an update on the Timberland tax case, the latest development being that oral arguments occurred last week, which was sooner than we anticipated. This advanced time line indicates the First Circuit Appeals Court could issue an opinion as early as the next few months. We previously expected this vision could occur within this fiscal year, and in light of the pace at which the oral arguments preceded, it's now increasingly evident that this will be the case. We continue to believe the timing and treatment of the income inclusion at issue is appropriate.Looking ahead to the future, we are confident that we have all the right ingredients to succeed and to return to our standard of delivering superior shareholder returns driven by strong, sustainable and profitable growth. We have a portfolio of world-renowned and beloved brands, which are well positioned in big and growing spaces, that continue to benefit from macro consumer tailwinds. We've taken significant actions to strengthen our business operationally and financially. I'm confident these initiatives will yield tangible benefits.We continue to work to drive improved product margins, including better go-to-market efficiencies, product cost optimization and strategic pricing actions. These near- and medium-term actions, combined with the ongoing focus to drive down costs, which are not consumer-facing, will support an expanding margin profile over time. We remain committed to our purpose, which is at the heart of everything we do, and we'll continue to remain sensitive to our culture and to our strategy. Our team of passionate, highly skilled and deeply committed associates continues to be a key asset to unlocking our full potential.In closing, we can and we will better harness the power and strength of VF while continuing to focus on sharpening execution, optimizing earnings and cash flow and strengthening the balance sheet, all of which will enable VF to begin to fulfill its full potential this year and beyond.With that, we'll now be joined by several members of the team to answer your questions: Martino Scabbia Guerrini, who runs our business in EMEA and APAC and in the emerging brands; and our brand leaders from Vans, The North Face, Timberland and Supreme, Kevin Bailey, Nicole Otto and Susie Mulder. We'll now open the line and take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first questions come from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.Dana Lauren TelseyBracken, welcome. Given your experience at your former company, Logitech, what is most similar, what is most different as in the work to transform VF? And then, Matt, on the results today, it looks like wholesale was the weakness nearly everywhere. How much of it was the impact overall in the Americas and Europe? And how does it differ by brand?Bracken P. DarrellThanks, Dana. I'm not quite ready to start to make comparisons between VF and Logitech. But I would just say the biggest surprise so far is how at home I feel, no surprises yet. So I'll update you more at the end of next quarter.Matthew H. PuckettYes. Dana, nice to speak with you. You're right. Most of the issues that we saw in our reported results certainly reside in the wholesale line, and that's kind of what we expected. I think we kind of talked about that in May. It is certainly an issue that's predominantly in the U.S. and in the Americas, to some degree in Europe. Obviously, APAC, not so much and APAC, the wholesale business is relatively smaller there.If you look at it across brands, disproportionate impacts to Vans and Dickies, which continue to be the 2 businesses that are struggling the most from a sell-through and sell-out perspective. The North Face, generally pretty good and Timberland, some timing issues with both of those brands. If you look at the Outdoor segment, generally, I think you're going to see -- we see better results across the board, and that's certainly the case in the wholesale business. And again, we see the more difficult results in those couple of brands that we continue to have challenges from a sell-out perspective, and we've talked a lot about that.All of our brands are having some impact from what's happening in the wholesale channel, particularly in the U.S., as wholesalers are resetting inventories, and that's been underway, in many cases, making good progress. In other cases, it's taking a bit longer. And the kind of the cautious approach that they're taking to forward buys, we're seeing that affect all of our businesses. But clearly, when you have a business that's not selling through, you give them even more reason to potentially be very cautious and pull back, and we're seeing that certainly in the Vans business.Dana Lauren TelseyGot it. And just one follow-up. As we move through the year and maintaining the guidance, any puts and takes as you see it either top line or margin in the cadence of the remaining quarters?Matthew H. PuckettYes. Sure thing. So from a top line perspective, it will sequentially get better. Q2 will be less negative than where we were in Q1. We said from the beginning the first half of the year will be relatively challenged given what we see in wholesale, and that stays the same. So we'll see sequential improvement as we move through the year.From a profitability standpoint, we hit our targets in the first quarter, our internal targets from a profitability standpoint. In fact, we obviously hit kind of where we thought we'd be from a revenue standpoint.When I step back and look at things, though, increasingly confident in our ability to drive higher gross margins this year. And as we look at where we sit from an inventory standpoint, we're making really good progress, a little bit ahead of schedule in reducing our inventories. And I look at the overall health of our inventory, I feel good about where we're positioned relative to where we've been, certainly. And so we'll see a moderating promotional environment is our view moving forward. We know we're going to see that in our own channels.And in the wholesale business, inventories are going to be down a lot. And the fact that we're actually moderating our assumptions in wholesale means we're going to sell in less, and that probably even helps that picture to some degree. So feel good about where we're heading there. And we'll see -- we'll begin to see benefits in terms of favorability on the promotional line, I think, as we move even over the next couple of quarters.The benefits of business mix continue to be quite strong given kind of where the revenue is coming from by geography and by channel and, I'd say, a clear visibility to easing product costs both in terms of FOBs, but in particular, on the freight line. So we'll have some -- we'll have a little bit of benefit there as you think about the net impact of price versus cost. So with more clarity and understanding where we sit, feel good about margins.And in SG&amp;A, we're going to be very careful. We'll continue to maintain pretty strict controls around how we're spending our money. And as we've shown here in Q1, when revenue is a little more difficult, we'll be very prudent and careful from a spending standpoint.OperatorOur next questions come from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets.Simeon Avram SiegelSo just maybe elaborate a little bit more on how you're viewing the promotional landscape. I know you're talking about what you can control and not. But any color there that you can dig into? And then sorry if I missed it, did you say what Vans DTC, how that performed? That would be helpful.Matthew H. PuckettYes. We didn't say what Vans DTC was. But let me come back to that. In terms of promotions, I think first and foremost, the inventory positions are going to be a lot cleaner than where we were last year. We know where our own inventory position is as we head into the fall holiday season. And with the actions that our partners have taken and obviously what's contemplated in our outlook for the year with much lower wholesale volume, we're going to be much better positioned there.And remember, too, for us, our promotions last year and our level of discounts were impacted by some of our own self-inflicted wounds, right, where we were late in shipping and we had to offer additional discounting to secure some of those volumes. And so we're up against that, and we're not going to repeat any of that given where we sit today from an inventory standpoint and really where the supply chain sits in their ability to service the business and deliver on time.So the inventories are going to be cleaner. Certainly, the wholesale marketplace is taking a more prudent and cautious approach. Our internal view of inventories will be -- position us to be a lot cleaner.I will say the one place where we'll continue to be pretty aggressive in promotions, and we've contemplated this in our outlook, obviously, is in our own outlet stores. That's where we're moving through the excesses and we've carried forward some excess inventory. As we've talked about from last year, that's contemplated and how we're filling those stores as we move through the balance of the year. And so we'll continue to be pretty aggressive there. But it will be more comparable to last year versus, I would say, worse, and we'll see nice benefits in our full-price channels in our wholesale business.And from a Vans standpoint, in the first quarter, we were down right at double digits from a DTC perspective.Simeon Avram SiegelGot it. And then just lastly, if I can, within the gross margin mix benefit, any way to help think about what's coming from channel versus geography and how to think about that going forward?Matthew H. PuckettYes. It's kind of split relatively evenly. Certainly, our international business continues to be a growth driver for us, and there's a nice margin benefit from that. And then with DTC slightly negative in the quarter but a fairly wide margin away from wholesale, you get a nice benefit. So it's about equal between those 2 pieces of the business. And moving forward -- we delivered about 80 basis points of favorability in the first quarter. As we move through the balance of the year, something in that range, maybe a little bit below that is probably the way to think about it.OperatorOur next questions come from the line of Laurent Vasilescu with BNP Paribas.Laurent Andre VasilescuBracken, great to have you on the call. We look forward to your updated thoughts 90 days from now.Bracken P. DarrellThank you.Laurent Andre VasilescuMatt, I wanted to follow up on Dana's question. I think you alluded to 2Q maybe slightly negative. I see consensus is modeling for revenues to be flat. Just for the audience, maybe can you give a little more color, just guidelines on how we think about 2Q revenues? And then I have a follow-up question on gross margins and SG&amp;A.Matthew H. PuckettYes. So we don't have guidance for Q2, Laurent. So I'm not going to give you guidance. But what I'll say is it will be sequentially less negative. I would also suggest that where we sit today, we'd expect a little bit more -- a slight benefit from currency on a reported basis in Q2. And certainly, you can figure that out as you look at where rates are versus last year but -- so sequentially less negative.Also, I would remind you that last year, had some noise in Q2, right? We were late shipping in particular, in the Outdoor segment, The North Face and Timberland most prominently. We were late delivering fall. We expect to be able to flow product fall this fall and normally. And we're positioned to certainly be able to set those floors at the right time. And so there's some noise there as you think about the flow of wholesale shipments, particularly in the outdoor segment between Q2 and Q3. So something just to remind you as you think about the modeling, but that's as far as I'm going to go.Laurent Andre VasilescuOkay. And then on the gross margin, it sounds like -- tell us if we're wrong, but you're taking down the gross margin, right? It was supposed to be exceeding 100 basis points for the year. Is it still the case? And maybe if you could give us some guardrails around how do you think gross margins should shake out for the year.And then it's nice to see on the SG&amp;A front that you can protect the earnings for this year. But the 3% decline in SG&amp;A, can you just maybe walk us through what drove that? And how do we think about that for the balance of the year?Matthew H. PuckettYes. Sure. So margins, we still expect -- we didn't change anything there, in my view, up at least 100 basis points. And actually, my point there would be increasingly confident in our ability to drive those higher gross margins. And that's kind of the point I made earlier about how we see the favorability in business mix that we saw in Q1 kind of continuing. The promotional environment is going to swing back in terms of -- the comp is going to get kind of the tailwind of that, begins even in the next quarter. Really, Q2 to Q4 last year, we had well north of 200 basis points every quarter. In fact, 300 basis points or so in the last part of the year.So that comes back in our favor. And even if we see a bit elevated level of promotions, we're going to see improvement year-over-year. That's our expectation. And then the product cost eases and actually potentially becomes a little bit of a tailwind in half 2 in terms of what we see. And the good news is we have pretty clear visibility now from a cost standpoint all the way through the fiscal year. So those are a couple of points I'd make on margin. But confidence in where we sit today, Laurent, I think is the message I'd want you to take away.And SG&amp;A, certainly, when we see revenue under pressure, we've got levers we can pull as we manage our controllable spending. There's a lot of fixed costs in a business like ours, certainly, but there's a lot that's in our control, too. There's discretionary spending that we can pull levers against. We can stop things that we think in the short term aren't having a significant impact on what we're trying to accomplish in executing with the consumer and with our customers. We've done that.We're working aggressively to optimize things like distribution capacity, I mentioned that. But similar types of things when you think about where revenue is under pressure, how do you kind of rationalize where it makes sense across your footprint and your capacity in different areas. And certainly, things like just pausing on projects that are longer-term oriented to focus on the near term. And the benefit there is cost, but also the benefit is focus. And that's really important to us as well, that we focus on the things that we've got to get fixed and we got to get right.And actually, it's kind of nice with -- as we begin to work with Bracken here, too, to kind of take a hard look at all those things, and that's something we're doing and certainly began to do in Q1 as we pulled back on some spending.OperatorOur next questions come from the line of Jay Sole with UBS.Jay Daniel SoleI guess if we can talk a little bit more about Vans. I think, Kevin Bailey, you're on the call. If we go back to January, maybe some of the opportunities that you were seeing, maybe some of the green shoots, I mean, are those still happening? I mean you talked about something like some of the newer footwear styles working better. But just give us an overall view of where things stand today with Vans, with the brand and the progress you're making turning around the brand. That would be very helpful.Kevin D. BaileyThanks, Jay. Happy to -- go ahead.Matthew H. PuckettKevin, I'm just going to say one thing, and then I'll turn it over to you, and I know you'll agree with this. We're not looking for a quick fix in this business. We're setting up the brand for long-term profitable growth, and we're not going to sacrifice that objective. I think that's really important. And it's taking longer than we would have liked. And certainly, the results that we saw this quarter, even if it's what we expected, it's not good. It was poor, and it's disappointing to see. But the team is working aggressively against the right things to turn the brand around. And I know you want some details on that. But Kevin, maybe unpack some of the things you're going after.Kevin D. BaileyYes. No, thanks, Matt. And Jay, you're spot on. I think, as Matt said, certainly, we're not happy delivering that kind of decline in the quarter. However, it was in line with our expectations as we anticipated that based on order book and what we were seeing a year ago or a little less than a year ago with the order book. But that said, as Matt said, we believe we can execute better and deliver better on our potential.Overall, the indicators on the brand remains strong. I think I said at Investor Day, consumers were really the piece that we needed to put at the front of our decision-making. And we're still seeing stable considerations, strong sentiment scores. Matt referenced our loyalty program. It's 2x its size 2 years ago. So that part of it is solid.As you asked about specifically the green shoots in product, that really is where I put my first attention because products in this footwear and apparel space is such a long lead time issue. And the new intros are working well. So things that we address around style, newness, versatility, comfort, which is what we had been hearing from our consumers but not responding adequately enough to, are starting to come to fruition with the product that we're bringing out like the Knu Skool, like the Lowland, like the Mary Jane, those are nice green shoots. They're still small at this point and not enough to offset the decline we've seen in Classics. However, the work we're doing in the background to bring bigger stories to the market faster that will deliver more results, we still feel really confident in.And then as Matt referenced, really leaning into expanding our franchises. I think in the past, our focus on Classics was so big that it distorted our opportunities. And what we're doing with things like the UltraRange and the MTE, growing it double digits, UltraRange, I think 13% for the quarter, MTE at 39% for the quarter, that's really where we believe there's a lot more opportunity to broaden our product meeting. So those are particularly important. Matt referenced launching pinnacle, and you'll start to see that in spring when the line first really comes to market.And then we have been continuing to work on consumer and getting really deep into understanding our segmentation study, integrating consumer data and analytics into everything we do, et cetera. So those are really our big priorities.However, we still believe execution is the opportunity. And what we're doing with SKU reduction of 20% to 30% that will be completed in August in our U.S. stores, that changes store layouts, simplifies the shopping experience for consumers but still delivers on the business we want to see. Overall, I think the things we said we were going to focus on are really working.OperatorOur next questions come from the line of Jonathan Komp with Baird.Jonathan Robert KompWelcome, Bracken. Just maybe one follow-up, if I could. Your initial intuition just on the time line to turn around any of the brands that are in focus or implement some changes, just curious to get your thoughts there. And just more of a broader question. You're obviously inheriting a financial plan for this year. But any thought to essentially a broader reset that would enable you to really accelerate some of the investments in the different areas of the business?Bracken P. DarrellYes. As I said, it's a little too early for me to respond to either one of those. But what I would say is I am -- I said earlier that I felt right at home. The 1 or 2 things that I feel most excited about coming in here are, one, the brands are even stronger than I expected. And it's nice to see -- I knew we had strong brands, but as I've gone through it, I feel really good about the brand equities and the potential of each brand. And the people here are really strong. So I'm super optimistic. I'm 12 days in, so I'm not ready to start talking about what we're going to do next, but I'm really excited about being here. And I promise you, I won't evade your question next quarter.Jonathan Robert KompUnderstood and appreciate that. Matt, if I could follow up then on the DTC assumption for the year. I think constant currency was down slightly for the quarter. Could you just give us more insight what you're planning for the year and especially for the Vans business, what's needed in the second half in order to hit the guidance here?Matthew H. PuckettYes. Certainly. Yes, DTC was slightly negative in the quarter. Of course, it's a smaller DTC quarter for us. Vans is a bigger part of the quarter -- a bigger part of the total in the quarter, even if the business has been declining, especially relative to the outdoor businesses that are certainly much more weighted toward the latter part of the year. So there's that going on.If you look at kind of the -- kind of carve-out Vans, which obviously we've talked a lot about, the DTC results in Q1, I think, we're up 7% for total VF. And I don't think, I know they were up 7% in Q1, which is kind of in line with where we've been. And if you think about across the year, that's kind of the range that we're looking at from a DTC perspective and growth across all regions. And certainly, expecting to see growth in the Vans DTC business as we move through the year. And then we've talked about at some point in the year seeing -- in the back half of the year seeing the Vans business begin to grow. That's certainly going to be driven by the direct-to-consumer business.Now all of that's also impacted by the comps and the compares, right? The compares get certainly quite a bit easier for Vans in particular, but for some of our other brands as well as we move through the year. So DTC will be a growth driver for us for the year. It will grow across regions, and generally expect it to grow across brands.OperatorOur next questions come from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.Brooke Siler RoachBracken, welcome. My question is for Matt, and I just wanted to have one quick follow-up on the Vans business. I'm curious what you're seeing in Vans China and the brand equity that you're seeing in that region as the market continues to reopen. APAC this quarter was down a couple of percent in constant currency. How is that brand trending there? What are the initiatives there? And what's embedded in the China outlook for the Vans brand to the back half?And then maybe for Kevin, as you think about Vans America and the challenge that you're seeing in Classics relative to the green shoots that you're seeing in some of the new product lines, is there any stabilization in trend in Classics' sell-through relative to where it had been trending as a result of some of these new initiatives that you've been implementing?Matthew H. PuckettBrooke, nice to speak with you. I'll take a little bit there, and Kevin, but I'm actually also going to ask Martino to chime in here because I know he was actually on the ground in China in the last few weeks and spent time with the team there and certainly looking across all the brands, and he's got his pulse on that. So I think it'd be interesting -- certainly, you'd be interested to hear his perspective on Vans in China.We certainly are seeing the business -- we saw growth in Vans in China in the quarter. So clearly, we're in a better place there in terms of kind of the inventory reset that's been underway. So we're cautiously optimistic that we're in a place where we'll continue to see good results coming out of that region as we move forward across the year.Overall, in APAC, it's been -- Korea has been weaker for us and Vans is a big -- one of our bigger businesses in Korea. Korea has been more challenged. But we're in a better place, I think, today with Vans in the region, particularly in China, than we were 6 months ago. Martino, anything you want to say about what's happening on the ground there with the team?Martino Scabbia GuerriniYes. Thanks, Matt. I think, first of all, we see China in a positive, right? So Q1 was up in the high single digits for Vans in China, which is good news. And I think when I was there a couple of weeks ago, what I started to see is really, as China reopens, a very strong engagement from consumers in stores beyond online. And don't forget that we're still underpenetrated in China. We target a broad consumer demographic there so -- with the growing emerging middle class, and that's a big opportunity.And at the same time, as we go back in store and launch new products, we also drive local for local product and storytelling. So the asset will also benefit from a stronger -- for Vans in particular, from a stronger local execution. And the recent Tokyo design center that we invested in and created in Tokyo actually to design and influence across China and Asia is going to drop new products also for Vans specifically in the second half of this year. So overall, the sentiment in China is turning positive as the country reopens, and Vans is part of that. And Kevin, maybe you want to add something from the specific brand side.Kevin D. BaileyYes. I can just add on China, Brooke, and then I can talk specifically to Classics that you asked about. I think Martino hit a lot of it. Localization is really key. China being our newest market, we have to really build Classics with an -- for the consumer understanding of the brand. However, they have a very specific ask. And as Martino said, we're leaning into localization to bring what they want from our product to the market. I'd also say they recovered really quick from COVID on inventories with our partner stores, and that really has given us the opportunity to start moving faster, as Martino said, to achieve the kind of growth we're seeing in China through DTC.And the last thing I'd really say there is really about Sk8. Skateboarding has taken on a real life in China as that started to grow, and the team ran a really strong Go Skateboarding Day. And we're really leading there, and we stood up a skate school with one of the big digital players. So the team there is doing a lot. Canvas is still not on trend from the search trends, but we're feeling good about where China is and how it's growing. We see a lot more opportunity.To get to your question on Americas and stabilization on Classics, I think I said it at Investor Day, we became overreliant on Classics and particularly on really just a couple of styles, and that really was a big piece of our underperformance, and that we didn't have a strong product pipeline behind it. So what you see in these green shoots, albeit small right now, are the opportunity to start doing franchises beyond Classics.So our focus really is, to your point, on stabilization is just that: stabilize our Classics business; bring style iterations to the market around Classics, which is where we're seeing success with our wholesale partners and our consumers who want newness, but build more and more the product propositions around Classics that are adjacent but relevant and give us a greater opportunity to diversify our product pipeline to the consumers. So stabilization of Classics is absolutely critical. As far as seeing it yet, not really yet because of the amount of product that was in the marketplace.OperatorOur next questions come from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.Irwin Bernard BoruchowMatt, maybe can you just help me with 2 questions. First, on Dickies, the decline you saw in the quarter, just how surprising was that versus your plan? Can you talk a little bit more about what's going on from a sell-in perspective to the mass channel over the last couple of months? And then is there any update on the PACS business? Is this still something that you guys are expecting to divest at some point this year? Just kind of looking for an update there.Matthew H. PuckettYes. Thanks, Ike. I do think I get to take both of those. As for Dickies, it was disappointing in the quarter. It didn't meet our expectations, just to be frank. The business continues to be impacted by soft results in the Americas and the network channel. Sell-through is falling short of expectations. I think we continue to see kind of outsized impacts from some of the challenges in the marketplace that are impacting that value in consumer a little more so than what we're seeing in other parts of our business.If there's a bright spot to some degree, our inventory positions are now in a pretty good place. In particular, our largest account, they're in a better place. And if sell-through improves across the pad and certainly for us, for Dickies, we're in a position that we can capitalize on that, and we'll see a nice replenishment [pop] at some stage. But to date, the underlying sell-through has continued to be short of our expectations.Europe continues to grow. I think that's another thing driven by the lifestyle part of the business. That's been important to us. But ultimately, we've got work to do here to improve that basic Work business in the U.S. and ensure we're driving that business effectively. And so that's a big focus of the team today.As it relates to PACS, first off, the business continues to perform well. If anything, it's a little better in Q1 than we anticipated, and it's set up for a really good back-to-school. Remember, we grew the top line nicely last year across the year, top and bottom line, and that continued into Q1. These brands continue to kind of have momentum and benefit from consumer trends, but I'd be remiss if I didn't say how happy and proud I am with the team and the work that they're doing, not easy environment when kind of what's going on around them with all the conversations that you asked about is happening, and they continue to do amazing work in that regard. So really impressed by what's happening there.The process is continuing. It takes time. There's a lot of interest. We're progressing discussions with a number of parties, and we'll be disciplined in the dealmaking, especially in light of where the business is. The results are good. We're generating good growth. We're generating -- strengthening EBITDA and acknowledging where the capital markets are today. We're just not going to accept the valuation we're not comfortable with. And until we find the right buyer for these brands at a valuation that we're happy with, will continue to be very discerning. So that's kind of the update I'd give you there.Irwin Bernard BoruchowAnd just one more quick one. On Vans in the back half, I know you've been asked this a few different ways. But I believe in May, you had said you expected to return to growth in the back half, and I believe your comments today were moderate the declines. I'm just -- do you expect Vans to be growing in any quarter of this year? Or should we now start to think about next year when the business potentially inflects the top line?Matthew H. PuckettYes. Ike, in May, we did not -- at least certainly not our intention, we did not indicate that we were projecting growth in the back half of the year. What we've said consistently, and I think we're still saying today, is that we expect to see the business return to growth at some point later this year, inflect to growth. And we haven't been specific on exactly when that is or kind of what the order of magnitude of that is. But that's what we said.OperatorOur next questions come from the line of John Kernan with TD Cowen.John David KernanMatt, just on the capital structure, how are you approaching capital allocation, the dividend commitment, the debt refinancing? You obviously have the potential sale of the backpack business if valuations get better there. How should we think about debt paydown, dividend and overall capital allocation going forward?Matthew H. PuckettYes. I mean I would say nothing's really changed from our stance on this over the last couple of quarters and certainly on the back of the cut in the dividend that we made a couple of months ago. Our -- we're focused on ensuring we've got the investments and the capital allocated to our organic portfolio that's necessary to kind of drive the growth that we're planning in that business over time. So big focus there for sure that we're not choking the business, and we're not.As it relates to free cash flow, certainly, dividend is something that we remain committed to at our target, right? And our target is about a 50% payout, and that's kind of what we're targeting. And we're in line with that, we think, this year. And kind of if you look at it in terms of the percent of -- whether it's net income or free cash flow, kind of both.And then after that, I would tell you that all excess free cash flow, we are using to pay down debt, and reducing debt that is our #1 financial priority. I think I made that clear in the prepared comments, and that remains consistent. So as we think about the choices that we're making from a capital allocation, everything is really through the lens of thinking our balance sheet, which really goes to reducing debt and reducing leverage, and that's our primary focus.John David KernanUnderstood. That's helpful. Maybe just one quick follow-up for Kevin. Specifically on Vans, I mean, we see the pressure in the U.S. wholesale channel across a lot of brands at this point. Just curious, when do you think open to buy dollars and maybe more risk appetite within that U.S. wholesale channel might start? Is it spring/summer next year? Like on the calendar, when you start to look at the business, how do we think about the recovery in that U.S. wholesale channel?Kevin D. BaileyYes. John, that's a good question. And I think that's the way we're thinking about it is that the opportunity, as we get into the back half of this year, what we're hearing from retailers, as you see all their reports as well, inventory traffic, promotions all affecting business in general. We've been focused on marketplace cleanup, marketplace execution, getting the newer product in their hands because that's what consumers are asking for.So I think we still believe that's going to happen as we get into the back half of this fiscal year for us. And I got to believe that things should start to stabilize in the marketplace as we turn the corner into spring/summer next year. But as Matt said, the order of magnitude is always -- it's a little hard right now given where wholesale is.OperatorOur final questions will come from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays.Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantNice to meet you, Bracken, as well. So Matt, for you, I guess, I'm still a little confused, and I may just be not interpreting the comments correctly. On the gross margin for the quarter, so there was a benefit from the mix of 80 basis points. But how did the freight and the promotions come through the P&amp;L in Q1? And then how should we think about the shaping of that for the rest of the quarters, knowing that freight is going to turn into a tailwind, that's number one.And then number two, can you talk about TNF and the timing? So you made a comment that last year, Q2, you couldn't ship and then -- I think, didn't have a lot of inventory and then you did ship in the third quarter. Q1 is your smallest quarter. So I'm just trying to figure out how we should think about kind of the ebbs and flows of year-on-year changes in the TNF wholesale business.Matthew H. PuckettYes. Thanks, Adrienne. So gross margins, I think you've got it in terms of Q1, nice mix benefit, 80 basis points, offset by a couple of hundred basis points of negative rate, which is about evenly split between promotions and FX. Product costs were a bit of a negative, but that was largely offset by pricing. And to your point, I think -- the point that I made, product costs are easing as we move through the year, on the back of freight, in particular, and eventually, we think, become a modest tailwind certainly in the back half of the year. That's how I'd characterize that.As it relates to The North Face, and I may ask Nicole to chime in here on a couple of things really around just kind of where we are and the trajectory of things. But yes, there's some timing issues a little bit between Q2 and Q3 that we'll navigate. Last year, we were late shipping. And so we shipped a little bit more in Q3 versus Q2 than we might normally ship. And the good news is we're positioned this year to ship in a more optimal way, which is -- we'll work our way through what that means in terms of the results as we get there. But most importantly, it positions us to be on the floor and have those floors set for fall to maximize full-price selling. So anything you want to add there, Nicole?Nicole Beth OttoNo, I just think we had a little bit of a timing issue between Q2 and Q1 in our results. But as you said, we really are going to monitor our operational and sell-through performance as we look at Q2 and Q3 together and normalize over the 2 quarters, really trying to hit those key dates for back-to-school and holiday floor sets with our partners and, of course, with our DTC business.OperatorThank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And with that, that does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.]"

This makes the dividend yield 4.5%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely.While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that Zions Bancorporation National Association's stock price has increased by 84% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield. View our latest analysis for Zions Bancorporation National Association Zions Bancorporation National Association's Earnings Will Easily Cover The DistributionsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained.Zions Bancorporation National Association has established itself as a dividend paying company with over 10 years history of distributing earnings to shareholders. Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 29%, which means that Zions Bancorporation National Association would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet.Over the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to fall by 11.0%. Fortunately, analysts forecast the future payout ratio to be 37% over the same time horizon, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendZions Bancorporation National Association Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.04 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.64. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 45% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.Story continuesThe Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that Zions Bancorporation National Association has been growing its earnings per share at 11% a year over the past five years. Zions Bancorporation National Association definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.We Really Like Zions Bancorporation National Association's DividendOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Zions Bancorporation National Association might even raise payments in the future. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For example, we've identified 2 warning signs for Zions Bancorporation National Association (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing.

279,ba5b921f-39a3-3fbf-a583-a6b023c96ff4,WFC,2023-08-03,Investing in Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) three years ago would have delivered you a 100% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-wells-fargo-nyse-wfc-130020519.html,1690981220,STORY,['WFC'],"[By buying an index fund, investors can approximate the average market return. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) share price is up 89% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 32% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 9.6% in the last year , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Wells Fargo was able to grow its EPS at 85% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 24% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 11.13.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Wells Fargo has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. Take a more thorough look at Wells Fargo's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Wells Fargo the TSR over the last 3 years was 100%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWells Fargo shareholders are up 9.6% for the year (even including dividends). But that was short of the market average. But at least that's still a gain! Over five years the TSR has been a reduction of 2% per year, over five years. So this might be a sign the business has turned its fortunes around. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Wells Fargo that you should be aware of before investing here.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

This could be especially true if economic headwinds momentarily reemerge. Plus, Encompass Health (EHC) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are two medical stocks that have largely outperformed their peers this year and may still offer defensive safety as healthcare is always essential.  Year to date Encompass and Vertex stocks are up +16% and +24% respectively and have easily topped the broader indexes over the last year. This serves as a prelude to why it’s time to buy Encompass and Vertex stock with both companies beating their second-quarter top and bottom line expectations on Tuesday.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEncompass Health: As a provider of integrated healthcare services, Encompass crushed its Q2 earnings expectations. Earnings of $0.95 per share came in 28% above Q2 estimates of $0.74 a share. On the top line, sales of $1.18 billion beat expectations by 2%. Year over year, Q2 earnings rose 6% despite sales falling -11% from the prior-year quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOffering facility-based patient care through its network of rehabilitation hospitals, analysts appear to be high on Encompass stock after Q2 results. Plus, the Average Zacks Price Target of $72.55 a share represents 7% upside from current levels and could be rising soon. Story continuesFurthermore, annual earnings are now expected to jump 12% this year and climb another 11% in fiscal 2024 at $3.54 per share. Total sales are forecasted to dip -3% in FY23 but rebound and rise 7% in FY24 to $5.10 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVertex Pharmaceuticals: Focused on developing drugs that target cystic fibrosis (CF) and other serious diseases Vertex also posted solid Q2 results on Tuesday.Second-quarter earnings of $3.89 per share topped estimates by 1% with sales of $2.49 billion coming in 3% above expectations. More impressive, Q2 earnings were up 8% YoY with sales jumping 13%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVertex’s annual earnings are expected to dip -2% in FY23 but rebound and jump 9% in FY24 at $15.91 per share. Notably, FY24 EPS projections would represent 74% growth over the last five years with 2020 earnings at $9.03 per share.Several analysts appear to be high on Vertex stock after earnings and are starting to raise their price targets.

The articles paint a picture of Mr. Heppner as a leader who exploited investors which, according to the lawsuit, includes falsehoods published with “actual malice.”A spokesperson for The Wall Street Journal, owned by News Corp, declined to comment as did Beneficient. News Corp has extensive ties to the Murdoch family including Rupert Murdoch who is executive chairman. The suit against Mr. Gladstone was filed by Clare Locke, a firm that sued Fox News in the voting machine scandal around the 2020 election that recently resulted in a $787.5 million settlement. Mr. Murdoch is also chair of Fox News parent Fox Corp. (The two companies split apart roughly a decade ago).Mr. Gladstone didn’t reply to a request for comment from IPO Edge.Story continuesOne aim of the lawsuit is to address a “false narrative” around legacy transactions, in particular an investment in the business from another company called GWG Holdings that was characterized as “Heppner’s takeover.” The suit says that the deal with GWG was made at arms length with approval from a special committee that didn’t include Mr. Heppner.The lawsuit says it was not Mr. Heppner’s deal as Mr. Gladstone suggests but was struck “as part of a larger strategy to diversify before Heppner became chairman of GWG’s board” at a time when Mr. Heppner “never had control or approval rights” and had no say in who was appointed to the GWG board.Furthermore, the suit says GWG invested in Beneficient “as part of a publicly disclosed business strategy, and GWG’s investment in Beneficient, at the time of Gladstone’s Article and tweet, was worth substantially more than the principal invested.”The suit goes on to emphasize that Beneficient attempted to share accurate information with Mr. Gladstone that he chose not to use. “When Gladstone asserted pre-publication that Beneficient ‘need[ed] to take that $230 million from GWG[,]’ he was explicitly contradicted by Plaintiffs’ representatives and warned the description was factually inaccurate—instead, the transaction described was an investment for value—and warned that the assertion that Beneficient ‘took’ money from GWG supported a false narrative,” the suit says.Beneficient is a technology-based platform designed to help medium-to-high net worth individuals and smaller institutions exit illiquid positions in alternative assets like private equity, which typically lock up investor money for a decade or so. Ben has taken steps to streamline the process so investors can apply for a quote entirely online – much like a car insurance quote on a standardized form. The tech allows Ben to offer liquidity in transactions as small as $100,000 – far below typical transactions that occur now.Needless to say, financial innovation can compel companies to navigate complex rules and regulations. Beneficient has two former Federal Reserve Presidents on its board: Richard Fisher of Dallas and Dennis Lockhart of Atlanta – both of whom have extensive experience in the world of money and banking.Contact: IPO-Edge.com Editor@IPO-Edge.com Twitter: @IPOEdge Instagram: @IPOEdge ]"

It will be the largest geospatial foundation model on Hugging Face and the first-ever open-source AI foundation model built in collaboration with NASA.IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM)Access to the latest data remains a significant challenge in climate science where environmental conditions change almost daily. And, despite growing amounts of data — estimates from NASA suggest that by 2024, scientists will have 250,000 terabytes of data from new missions — scientists and researchers still face obstacles in analyzing these large datasets. As part of a Space Act Agreement with NASA, IBM set out earlier this year to build an AI foundation model for geospatial data. And now, by making a geospatial foundation model available via Hugging Face — a recognized leader in open-source and a well-known repository for all transformer models — efforts can advance to democratize access and application of AI to generate new innovations in climate and Earth science.""The essential role of open-source technologies to accelerate critical areas of discovery such as climate change has never been clearer,"" said Sriram Raghavan, Vice President, IBM Research AI. ""By combining IBM's foundation model efforts aimed at creating flexible, reusable AI systems with NASA's repository of Earth-satellite data, and making it available on the leading open-source AI platform, Hugging Face, we can leverage the power of collaboration to implement faster and more impactful solutions that will improve our planet.""""AI remains a science-driven field, and science can only progress through information sharing and collaboration,"" said Jeff Boudier, head of product and growth at Hugging Face. ""This is why open-source AI and the open release of models and datasets are so fundamental to the continued progress of AI, and making sure the technology will benefit as many people as possible.""Story continues""We believe that foundation models have the potential to change the way observational data is analyzed and help us to better understand our planet,"" said Kevin Murphy, Chief Science Data Officer, NASA. ""And by open sourcing such models and making them available to the world, we hope to multiply their impact.""The model – trained jointly by IBM and NASA on Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 satellite data (HLS) over one year across the continental United States and fine-tuned on labeled data for flood and burn scar mapping — has demonstrated to date a 15 percent improvement over state-of-the-art techniques using half as much labeled data. With additional fine tuning, the base model can be redeployed for tasks like tracking deforestation, predicting crop yields, or detecting and monitoring greenhouse gasses. IBM and NASA researchers are also working with Clark University to adapt the model for applications such as time-series segmentation and similarity research.The news follows IBM's announcement earlier this year to collaborate with NASA to build an AI model that could speed up the analysis of satellite images and boost scientific discovery. It's also part of NASA's decade-long Open-Source Science Initiative to build a more accessible, inclusive, and collaborative scientific community. NASA, along with the White House and other federal agencies, has declared 2023 a Year of Open Science to celebrate the benefits and successes created through the open sharing of data, information, and knowledge.The model leverages IBM foundation model technology and is part of IBM's larger effort to create and train AI models that can be used for different tasks and apply information from one situation to another. In June, IBM announced the availability of watsonx, an AI and data platform that allows enterprises to scale and accelerate impact of the most advanced AI with trusted data. A commercial version of the geospatial model, which is part of IBM watsonx, will be available through the IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite (EIS) later this year.For more information about this collaboration, visit the IBM Research BlogStatements regarding IBM's future direction and intent are subject to change or withdrawal without notice, and represent goals and objectives only.About IBMIBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

You can skip our detailed analysis on the subject and head over directly to the 5 Most Educated States in America.The Bureau of Labor Statistics, in a report in 2022, established the direct link between educational attainment and income levels in the United States. Earnings rise as you further climb the ladder in terms of education. An individual with less than a high school diploma makes $682 per week, on average, compared to $1,432 for someone holding a bachelor’s degree, $1,661 for master’s degree, and over $2,000 per week for those with professional or doctoral degrees.Massachusetts is the most educated state in America, with 46.6% of its population aged 25 and above holding a bachelor’s degree or higher. Moreover, close to one-thirds of its youth in the age group of 18-24 years have completed some college or associate's degree. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' report linking education to income levels is validated by the fact that Massachusetts is also one of the 20 Wealthiest States in America, ranked seventh, with over 250,000 millionaires and 20 billionaires. Massachusetts is also home to the Ivy League Harvard University, established in 1636 in Cambridge, a major suburb in the Greater Boston area. In contrast, West Virginia is the least educated state in America. Only 24.1% of the population in the age bracket analyzed for this research have attained higher education, of which 14.2% have completed bachelor's degree, while only 9.9% hold a graduate or professional degree.An article last year identified companies that were playing their roles in driving down the cost of education to make it more accessible for all. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of them. The tech giant’s AWS on-demand cloud computing platform provides digital infrastructure support for many online educational companies, and helps them scale up their ability to handle more activity on their platforms.

This was mainly driven by strong top-line growth, organic operating margin expansion and productivity savings. Effective marketing and exceptional commercial execution further aided the results.On a reported basis, net sales increased 10.7%, driven by strong organic growth and favorable currency impacts. Organic net sales were up 6.5% year over year, driven by a robust price mix, offset by a decline in volume. The company delivered a positive price mix of 7.3% in fiscal 2023. The price/mix benefited from a high-single-digit contribution from pricing and premiumization. The reported volume declined 7.4% in fiscal 2023, while the organic volume was down 0.8%. Sales improved in four of its five regions, with double-digit growth in Europe and the Asia Pacific.Organic sales growth was driven by improvements across most categories, particularly its top three categories — scotch, tequila and beer, which delivered double-digit organic sales growth. The company’s premium-plus brands contributed 63% of the reported sales growth and 57% of the total organic sales growth for fiscal 2023.Shares of the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have lost 8% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 0.3%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The company’s operating profit improved 5.1% in fiscal 2023, driven by robust organic operating profit growth, offset by the negative impacts of certain exceptional operating items and currency. Organic operating profit advanced 7%. The reported operating margin contracted 147 bps, while the organic operating margin increased 15 bps. The organic operating margin was aided by disciplined cost management. Gains from price increases more than offset the impacts of cost inflation on the gross margin.On its fiscal 2023 earnings call, management noted that Diageo would change its reporting from sterling to the U.S. dollar starting fiscal 2024.Story continuesFinancialsIn fiscal 2023, Diageo delivered net cash from operating activities of £3 billion, marking a year-over-year decline of £0.9 billion. DEO reported a strong free cash flow of £1.8 million, down £1 billion from last year’s level due to higher working capital outflows, tax and interest payments, and capital investments. This was offset by gains from higher operating profit and favorable currency.Diageo is committed to its disciplined approach to capital allocation primarily to enhance its shareholder value. In fiscal 2023, the company incurred a capital expenditure of £1.2 billion related to supply capacity, sustainability, digital capabilities and consumer experiences.DEO increased the final dividend 5% to 49.17 pence per share. This reflects its strong liquidity position and confidence in the long-term health of its business.Additionally, Diageo completed £1.4 billion of return of capital in fiscal 2023, including £0.9 billion linked to the completion of its £4.5-billion multi-year program. The company returned £0.5 billion in the second half of fiscal 2023. On its fiscal 2023 earnings call, the company approved a return of capital program of up to $1 billion.FY24 &amp; Long-Term ViewAlthough the company expects the operating environment to be challenging in fiscal 2024, it predicts a gradual improvement in year-over-year comparisons in the second half. The company expects the operating margin in fiscal 2024 to benefit from a moderating inflationary environment and continued focus on revenue management initiatives, including improved pricing. Moreover, the organic operating margin is likely to benefit from premiumization trends and operating leverage with strong marketing investments.  The company anticipates the tax rate before exceptional items to be 24% for fiscal 2024. It expects the effective interest rate to be above 4% in the fiscal.For fiscal 2024, the company expects a capital expenditure of $1.3-$1.5 billion (£1-£1.2 billion).Moreover, it notes that it is on track to deliver on its medium-term guidance for fiscal 2023-2025, wherein it targets organic sales growth of 5-7% and organic operating profit growth of 6-9%.Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Molson Coors TAP, The Duckhorn Portfolio NAPA and The Boston Beer Company SAM.Molson Coors currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Now the rival duo are 50% bigger than Bud Light—and the outlook for Molson Coors remains rosy.Hattersley said the ""seismic shift"" in the U.S. market had such an outsized impact that his company now expects global underlying income before tax to grow by 23%-26% this year, an increase from his previous expectation for low single-digit growth. His brewer also issued a more bullish forecast for sales and cashflow.“We haven’t seen any slowdown in momentum for our brands,” Hattersley added after his U.S. breweries enjoyed their highest levels of production in May and June since 2019.The Molson Coors boss had more bad news for his counterpart. Anheuser-Busch CEO Brendan Whitworth’s attempts to end the crippling boycott of Bud Light by slashing prices around summer holiday failed to make a dent in demand for Coors Light and Miller Lite.“it’s important to note that the competitive pricing moves around Memorial Day and Fourth of July did not appear to have a negative impact on our brands, as our share gains continued,” said Hattersley.Shelf space resetThe Molson Coors CEO furthermore confirmed recent suspicions from former AB sales chief Anson Frericks that beer retailers are moving forward their shelf space reset from the spring to the fall, allocating fewer square feet to display Bud Light beer.Story continuesThis would lock in of sustained loss in market share: “We expect some portion of the current trends to be structural.”Tasting blood, Hattersley is now leaning in with a commitment to spend a further $100 million in marketing so he can steal more market share from Anheuser-Busch, which is already firing employees even as it splashes out for an expensive new promotional campaign.While Hattersley didn’t want to venture too much of a guess into how much of Bud Light’s market share he can retain, he promised to provide a view of his company’s longer term future at the upcoming strategy day in New York City scheduled for Oct. 3.“We could not have foreseen the shifts in consumer behavior that began in the second quarter,” added his finance chief, Tracey Joubert.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

A Thorough GF Value AnalysisUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value. It is computed considering historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line denotes the stock's ideal fair trading value.With a current price of $292.78 per share, Waters (NYSE:WAT) appears to be modestly undervalued according to the GF Value. This assessment is based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment factor related to the company's past growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If a stock's price significantly exceeds the GF Value Line, it may be overvalued and likely to yield poor future returns. Conversely, if the price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued, promising higher future returns.Is Waters Corp (WAT) Modestly Undervalued? A Thorough GF Value AnalysisConsidering Waters' relative undervaluation, the long-term return of its stock is likely to exceed its business growth. Here are some other companies that may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Story continuesAssessing Financial StrengthBefore investing in a company, it's crucial to evaluate its financial strength. Companies with weak financial health pose a higher risk of permanent loss. The cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can provide a good understanding of a company's financial strength. Waters has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.31, which is lower than 75.21% of companies in the Medical Diagnostics &amp; Research industry. This indicates that Waters' financial strength is fair, with a score of 6 out of 10.Is Waters Corp (WAT) Modestly Undervalued? A Thorough GF Value AnalysisProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent long-term profitability, tends to be less risky. Waters Corp (NYSE:WAT) has been profitable for 10 out of the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $3 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $11.51. Its operating margin is 28.73%, ranking better than 95.15% of companies in the Medical Diagnostics &amp; Research industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks Waters' profitability at 10 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.One of the most crucial factors in a company's valuation is its growth. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Waters is 11.7%, ranking better than 51.49% of companies in the Medical Diagnostics &amp; Research industry. However, its 3-year average EBITDA growth is 11.4%, which ranks worse than 50.52% of companies in the industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) to its Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is another effective way to assess its profitability. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it suggests that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Waters' ROIC was 29.13, while its WACC was 9.12.Is Waters Corp (WAT) Modestly Undervalued? A Thorough GF Value AnalysisConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Waters Corp (NYSE:WAT) shows signs of being modestly undervalued.

The United Auto Workers (UAW) union declined immediate comment.Last week, a group of 28 senators including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer urged GM, Chrysler-parent Stellantis and Ford Motor to recognize joint venture battery workers under national labor agreements before the current contracts expire on Sept. 14.If battery workers were covered under the national agreement, they would likely be eligible for better pay and benefits.Senators and the union have heavily criticized Ultium for paying low wages at the Ohio plant and noted some make just half as much as workers did at a nearby shuttered GM assembly plant.The senators including Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown wrote last week it is a ""national disgrace that the starting wage at any current American joint venture electric vehicle battery facility is $16 an hour,"" arguing it represents ""poverty-level wages"" amid ""extreme financial gains for the companies, executives, and investors.""Ultium said on Wednesday it ""has provided a proposal for a fully comprehensive collective bargaining agreement, including substantial wages and benefits.""In December, workers at the Ultium Cells Ohio plant overwhelmingly voted to join the UAW.Ultium said ""during our 6-month collective bargaining process, the UAW has not provided any wage proposals or counter proposals.""Stellantis North American Chief Operating Officer Mark Stewart told employees this week in a letter seen by Reuters the transition to electric vehicles ""will require us to work collaboratively to find ways to offset the 40% increase in the cost of battery-powered vehicles.""UAW President Shawn Fain said Tuesday the union was seeking double-digit pay rises, a shorter work week, defined-benefit pensions and other contract improvements.Fain singled out GM CEO Mary Barra, who received $29 million in compensation in 2022, and said it would take an entry level worker at Ultium Ohio 16 years to earn as much as she made in a week.

We expected cemetery revenues to come in at $429.4 million. Comparable cemetery revenue rose 1.2%, on higher core revenue.

These factors were somewhat offset by a decline in the velocity of contracts sold.Comparable cemetery gross profit fell $4.1 million to $146.1 million mainly due to escalated cost structure mainly stemming from inflationary employee-related expenses.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Kimberly-Clark Corp. KMB, McCormick &amp; Company, Inc. MKC, J&amp;J Snack Foods Corp. JJSF and TreeHouse Foods, Inc. THS.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:4 Safe Stocks to Buy as Fed Remains Open to More Rate HikesThe Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points on Jul 26 after taking a brief pause in June. The hike was widely expected as the Fed believes that inflation is still elevated and has remained open for more hikes depending on economic data in the near term.Inflation has been cooling steadily over the past 12 months, raising hope among market participants that the Fed will soon end its current monetary tightening cycle. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined to 3% in June after rising 4% in May. Understandably, CPI has fallen considerably after peaking to 9.1% in June 2022.According to the latest data from the Commerce Department, Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation and the core PCE inflation rose by 2.6% and 3.8%, respectively, in the second quarter. The figures hint at cooling inflation compared to an increase of 4.1% for PCE and 4.9% for core PCE in the first quarter.The headline PCE inflation also increased just 3% in June on a year-over-year basis, to hit its lowest level since March 2021. Moreover, U.S. GDP grew an impressive 2.4% in the second quarter, following a rise of 2% in the first quarter.The picture is rosy but the Fed remains concerned as inflation is far from its target range of 2%. The Fed has increased interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022 to take the federal funds rate to 5.25-5.50%, marking the highest level since March 2001.Although central bank officials are confident that the economy may now have a softer landing as inflation continues to ease, it believes that more interest rate hikes are required to get full control over the economy's health.Story continuesMoreover, the Fed believes that the economy is still holding strong as the labor market remains resilient. Job creation has slowed but the U.S. economy added 290,000 jobs in June, while the unemployment rate is still quite low at 3.6%.Hence, the crisis is far from over and the Fed may go for more interest rate hikes. Interest rate hikes can be detrimental to the economy amid the looming risk of a recession. They impact consumer spending habits, increase borrowing expenses, and impede overall economic growth.Moreover, given this situation, the first interest rate cut is not expected before 2025, although some market participants speculate it might occur in 2024.Investors should thus focus on stocks that offer risk-adjusted returns like Kimberly-Clark Corp., McCormick &amp; Company, Inc., J&amp;J Snack Foods Corp. and TreeHouse Foods, Inc..These stocks belong to the consumer staples sector that are non-cyclical in nature, meaning their businesses are not heavily influenced by market fluctuations.Our ChoicesKimberly-Clark Corporation is principally engaged in the manufacture and marketing of a wide range of consumer products around the world.

321,888a4e26-175f-3ee4-938b-89b124ab02fd,UAL,2023-08-03,Fitch Downgrades U.S. Rating: 5 Stocks to Buy on the Dip,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fitch-downgrades-u-rating-5-121400668.html,1690978440,STORY,"['UBER', 'MANH', 'UAL', 'TTD', 'LYV']","[On Aug 1, Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from AAA. The agency cited “expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.” In May, Fitch placed the AAA rating of the nation in the negative watchlist. Fitch expects the general government deficit to rise to 6.3% of U.S. GDP in 2023 from 3.7% in 2022. The agency remained concerned about a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years. Notably, in 2011, S&amp;P had downgraded the U.S. credit rating to AA+ from AAA.Consequently, U.S. stock futures are trading in negative territory. In early morning trading, several key markets of the Asia-Pacific region also traded in the red. However, we believe that any dip in U.S. stock prices following Fitch’s sovereign rating downgrade will provide a good opportunity to accumulate stocks.U.S. Economy Remains StrongThe Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that U.S. GDP grew 2.4% in second-quarter 2023 after rising 2% in the first quarter. The U.S. GDP increased 2.6% in fourth-quarter 2022. The second-quarter GDP growth rate eliminates the concerns of a large section of economists and financial researchers that the economy may fall into a recession in the near future.The U.S. labor market remains resilient. Month over month, personal expenditure — the largest driver of GDP — rose 0.5% in June compared with 0.2% in May. The personal savings rate stayed healthy at 4.3%.The inflation rate is dwindling steadily since June 2022. Consequently, the Fed is approaching the end of its ongoing interest rate hike cycle. The central bank is now more confident about the soft landing of the economy.Our Top PicksAt this stage, we have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) growth stocks that have strong potential for the rest of 2023. Any dip in these stock prices will be a good opportunity to enter.These stocks have also witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days.

This compares to earnings of $0.44 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this electric and gas utility would post earnings of $0.61 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.67, delivering a surprise of 9.84%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Fortis , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $1.93 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.93%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.95 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Fortis shares have added about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.2%.What's Next for Fortis?While Fortis has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Fortis: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.55 on $1.98 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.23 on $8.63 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

323,ac8ca17f-d2f7-3f51-93e1-6a004d8125b3,PNW,2023-08-03,"Utilities Stocks Reporting Q2 Earnings on Aug 3: PNW, LNT & More",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/utilities-stocks-reporting-q2-earnings-121100342.html,1690978260,STORY,['PNW'],"[The Zacks Utilities sector’s second-quarter 2023 earnings are expected to have been adversely impacted by unfavorable weather conditions and ongoing interest rate hikes. However, some of the companies are likely to have gained from cost-saving initiatives and usage of new technologies that helped in increasing the reliability of their services and lowering operating and maintenance expenses.Per the latest Earnings Preview, the Zacks Utilities sector’s second-quarter earnings and revenues are expected to have declined 5.7% and 0.7%, respectively. While the capital-intensive utility stocks might have been impacted by the ongoing rise in interest rates, new rates implemented in their service territories and customer growth are likely to have boosted profits.Factors to NoteThe performance of capital-intensive domestic-focused utilities is expected to have been adversely impacted by an increase in interest rates as capital servicing costs rise substantially from the current levels.Except in the case of any major weather variation, demand for utility services remains more or less steady, regardless of economic cycles. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration report, mild weather conditions during the first half of 2023 are likely to have resulted in a 3% decline in electricity usage, year over year. Thus, mild weather might have adversely impacted utility earnings during the second quarter.However, Utilities continue to benefit from various favorable factors, such as new electric rates, customer additions, cost management and the implementation of energy-efficiency programs. Also, the ongoing investments to improve the resiliency of electric infrastructure against extreme weather conditions and the transition to cost-effective, renewable energy sources to produce electricity aid the power industry. Furthermore, the government is assisting in increasing the use of renewable energy through tax credits.The Inflation Reduction Act will support and accelerate the Utilities’ transition toward clean-energy sources. The Act has removed uncertainties related to federal incentives for the usage of renewable sources. It also entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way and is expected to boost earnings potential.According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

325,df175233-0fa7-3ca0-a4bb-04166fa3fa3a,ISRG,2023-08-03,7 Millionaire-Maker Healthcare Stocks to Buy Before the Window Closes,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-millionaire-maker-healthcare-stocks-134227803.html,1690465347.0,STORY,"['MCK', 'DHR', 'TDOC', 'JNJ', 'ISRG', 'UNH']","[Healthcare continues to be a major industry and economic driver around the world. According to the American Medical Association, spending on healthcare in the U.S. totals more than $4 trillion each year, which works out to nearly $13,000 per person. And the amount being spent on health is forecast to continue rising in coming years as the American population ages. By 2028, the U.S. is expected to be spending more than $6 trillion a year on healthcare, representing an increase of 50% in only five years. This makes healthcare stocks a fairly safe bet for buy-and-hold investors. Long-term, few stocks are likely to outperform those in the healthcare sector. This includes stocks of pharmaceutical companies, health insurers, medical device manufacturers, and firms involved in the growing field of virtual medicine. As the medical sector grows dramatically, we offer up seven millionaire-maker healthcare stocks to buy before the window closes.Danaher (DHR)image of laptop screen displaying danaher (DHR) websiteSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comDanaher Corp. (NYSE:DHR), which makes highly technical and life-saving medical devices, just reported second-quarter earnings, and, as usual, the company beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom lines. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.05, which was better than the consensus expectation of analysts for earnings of $2 a share. Revenue for Q2 came in at $7.16 billion, which was also above Wall Street forecasts of $7.11 billion, according to Refinitiv data.It was the fourth consecutive quarter in which Danaher beat Street forecasts for its earnings per share. Yet, in a cruel twist of fate, Danaher’s stock fell after the latest earnings print due to weaker-than-expected free cash flow. Danaher said that its Q2 free cash flow amounted to $1.59 billion, which was below consensus analyst forecasts of $1.73 billion. DHR stock is now down 7% over the last 12 months. Investors should see it as a buy-the-dip opportunity. In the last five years, the stock has risen nearly 150%.Story continuesInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsJohnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comHealthcare and pharmaceutical giant Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) also just reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings and raised its full-year guidance as sales in its MedTech business unit strengthened. Johnson &amp; Johnson reported EPS of $2.80 versus $2.62 that had been expected on Wall Street. In the quarter ended June 30, revenue amounted to $25.53 billion compared to $24.62 billion, which was expected among analysts tracking the company’s progress.Johnson &amp; Johnson said in its earnings print that it is benefitting from a rebound in non-urgent surgeries among older adults who had deferred many procedures during the pandemic. Consequently, the company raised its forward guidance, saying it now expects full-year revenue of $98.8 billion to $99.8 billion, which is about $1 billion higher than previous guidance. The company also raised its 2023 earnings outlook, saying it expects EPS of $10.70 to $10.80, up from a previous range of $10.60 to $10.70 a share.JNJ stock has been flat over the last 12 months (up 0.02%), and it pays a quarterly dividend of $1.19 a share for a decent yield of 2.76%.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)United Health StockSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAnother company that just crushed its Q2 print is UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the largest health insurer in the U.S. The company, which is bigger than the largest banks in America, reported an EPS of $6.14 versus the $5.99 that had been expected on the Street. Revenue for the quarter came in at $92.9 billion compared to consensus estimates of $91.01 billion. UnitedHealth attributed the earnings beat to its $8 billion acquisition of the healthcare technology company Change Healthcare, as well as a spike in the number of patients served.The typically strong earnings underscore why UNH stock is a long-term winner for investors. Over the last five years, UNH stock has effectively doubled. The company’s share price has gained more than 600% during the past decade. Looking ahead, the company lifted the low end of its full-year earnings outlook to EPS of $24.70 to $25, up from a previous forecast of $24.50 to $25.00 per share. With its size and earning power, UNH is one of the best healthcare stocks to buy and hold.McKesson (MCK)McKesson headquarters in Irving, TXSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMcKesson Corp. (NYSE:MCK) is another huge U.S. healthcare company that has a track record of delivering strong returns to stockholders. The company delivers a third of all pharmaceuticals used in the U.S. and Canada and also provides health information technology, medical supplies, and care management tools. Today, McKesson has nearly 80,000 employees and annual revenues approaching $300 billion. The company also runs a retail chain of pharmacies within Canada.MCK stock has had a bumpy ride over the last year as the company was caught up in the opioid crisis and related financial settlements. This year, McKesson’s share price is up 10%, trailing the S&amp;P 500 index’s gain of nearly 20%. However, through five years, MCK stock is up 232%, proving that it is a healthcare stock to buy. Currently trading at 16 times future earnings and with a quarterly dividend payout of 62 cents a share, McKesson’s stock has a lot to recommend it.Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in backgroundSource: shutterstock.com/Michael ViIf there’s one healthcare stock to make your millionaire dreams come true, it is pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY). The company’s share price has been running circles around other pharma stocks this year on growing excitement over Mounjaro, or Tirzepatide as it is also known, a medication that treats Type 2 Diabetes but has also been found to cause dramatic weight loss in people, opening the door for it to be used to treat obesity.The company anticipates getting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to sell Mounjaro as a weight loss treatment by year’s end. Some analysts are confidently forecasting that Mounjaro will be the biggest blockbuster drug of all time. Several analysts have raised their price targets on LLY stock recently, including Morgan Stanley, which maintained a “buy” rating and lifted its target on the stock to $560, implying a 23% upside from current levels. LLY stock has gained 38% in the last 12 months.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAnother buy-the-dip candidate can be found in Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), the company that makes robotic instruments for minimally invasive surgical procedures. ISRG stock has dropped 8% since the company recently posted Q2 earnings. The decline is disappointing given that the company beat Wall Street forecasts across the board, reporting EPS of $1.42 and revenue of $1.76 billion, which beat expectations of $1.33 in earnings on $1.74 billion in revenue, according to Refinitiv data.ISRG stock fell after the Q2 print because the company’s systems unit revenue came in lighter than forecast at $392.7 million, missing consensus estimates for $415.9 million. However, the dip presents a gift to investors who can now take a position in ISRG stock at a favorable price. Despite the recent drop, Intuitive Surgical’s stock is still up 25% this year, has increased 53% over the last 12 months, and has gained more than 90% through five years. Make no mistake. This is a millionaire-maker healthcare stock.Teladoc Health (TDOC)The Teladoc logo through a magnifying glass.Source: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.comInvestors with an appetite for risk should consider Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC). The company behind telemedicine and virtual doctor appointments was a darling during the pandemic as healthcare consultations were forced online. Coming out of the global health emergency though, TDOC stock has cratered as patient visits plunged and investors soured on the company and its business model. Teladoc shares are now trading 93% below the all-time high they reached in Feb. 2021, just before the pandemic trade reversed.Another issue facing TDOC stock is poor earnings and a lack of profits at the company. However, in this area, Teladoc Health has made major strides. The company just reported Q2 earnings that showed its revenue rose 10% year-over-year to $652.4 million, which was in line with consensus estimates. More importantly, the company’s net loss narrowed dramatically to $65.2 million from $3.1 billion in the same quarter of 2022. TDOC stock is down 43% in the last 12 months. But the share price jumped 7% higher on the Q2 print. Time to buy the dip.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in DHR and LLY.

The charges were primarily costs associated with the consolidation of converting facilities, ongoing costs related to previously closed operations, and acquisition, integration and divestiture costs.Cash Flow ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $694 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $837 million in the prior year quarter primarily due to lower earnings.Total debt was $9.0 billion at March 31, 2023, and Adjusted Net Debt was $8.6 billion. Total debt decreased $479 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company had approximately $3.5 billion of available liquidity from long-term committed credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2023.During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, WestRock invested $255 million in capital expenditures and returned $71 million in capital to stockholders in dividend payments.Segment ResultsWe have included the financial results of the Mexico Acquisition in our Corrugated Packaging segment.WestRock’s segment performance for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was as follows (in millions):Corrugated Packaging SegmentThree Months EndedJun. 30, 2023Jun. 30, 2022Var.% Var.Segment sales$2,565.7$2,382.5$183.27.7%Adjusted EBITDA$429.7$385.2$44.511.6%Adjusted EBITDA Margin16.7%16.2%50 bpsCorrugated Packaging segment sales increased primarily due to sales from the Mexico Acquisition and higher selling price/mix that were partially offset by lower volumes excluding the Mexico Acquisition. In addition, the third quarter of fiscal 2023 included $37 million of segment sales for certain converting operations that were included in the Consumer Packaging segment in the prior year period.Corrugated Packaging Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to net cost deflation, the incremental contribution from the Mexico Acquisition, cost savings and the margin impact from higher selling price/mix, which were partially offset by lower volumes excluding the Mexico Acquisition, economic downtime, planned maintenance outages and non-cash pension costs, each as compared to the prior year period. Corrugated Packaging Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.7% and Adjusted EBITDA margin excluding trade sales was 17.4%.Consumer Packaging SegmentThree Months EndedJun. 30, 2023Jun. 30, 2022Var.% Var.Segment sales$1,250.6$1,270.2$(19.6)-1.5%Adjusted EBITDA$230.0$234.9$(4.9)-2.1%Adjusted EBITDA Margin18.4%18.5%-10 bpsConsumer Packaging segment sales decreased primarily due to lower volumes and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. In addition, the third quarter of fiscal 2022 included $37 million of segment sales for certain converting operations now included in the Corrugated Packaging segment. These items were partially offset by higher selling price/mix.Consumer Packaging Adjusted EBITDA decreased primarily due to lower volumes, net cost inflation, economic downtime and non-cash pension costs. In addition, the third quarter of fiscal 2022 included $8 million of Adjusted EBITDA for certain converting operations now included in the Corrugated Packaging segment. These items were largely offset by the margin impact from higher selling price/mix and cost savings, each as compared to the prior year period. Consumer Packaging Adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.4%.Global Paper SegmentThree Months EndedJun. 30, 2023Jun. 30, 2022Var.% Var.Segment sales$1,065.7$1,610.3$(544.6)-33.8%Adjusted EBITDA$177.0$399.0$(222.0)-55.6%Adjusted EBITDA Margin16.6%24.8%-820 bpsGlobal Paper segment sales decreased primarily due to lower volumes and lower selling price/mix.

Measures and ReconciliationsWe calculate cost savings as the year-over-year change in certain costs incurred for manufacturing, procurement, logistics, and selling, general and administrative, in each case excluding the impact of economic downtime and inflation. Cost savings achieved to date may not recur in future periods, and estimates of future savings are subject to change.WestRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP""). However, management believes certain non-GAAP financial measures provide WestRock’s management, board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions, and in evaluating WestRock’s performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, WestRock’s GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we present may differ from similarly captioned measures presented by other companies.Business Systems Transformation CostsIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, WestRock launched a multi-year phased business systems transformation project. Due to the nature, scope and magnitude of this investment, management believes these incremental transformation costs are above the normal, recurring level of spending for information technology to support operations. Since these strategic investments, including incremental nonrecurring operating costs, will cease at the end of the investment period, are not expected to recur in the foreseeable future, and are not considered representative of our underlying operating performance, management believes presenting these costs as an adjustment in the non-GAAP results provides additional information to investors about trends in our operations and is useful for period-over-period comparisons. This presentation also allows investors to view our underlying operating results in the same manner as they are viewed by management.We discuss below details of the non-GAAP financial measures presented by us and provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAWestRock uses the non-GAAP financial measure ""Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA"", along with other factors such as ""Adjusted EBITDA"" (a measure of performance the Company uses to evaluate segment results in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 280 (""ASC 280"")), to evaluate our overall performance. Management believes that the most directly comparable GAAP measure to ""Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA"" is ""Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders"". It can also be derived by adding together each segment’s ""Adjusted EBITDA"" plus ""Non-allocated expenses"". Management believes this measure provides WestRock’s management, board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate WestRock’s performance because it excludes restructuring and other costs, impairment of goodwill and other assets, business systems transformation costs and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the business. WestRock’s management and board use this information to evaluate WestRock’s performance relative to other periods.Adjusted EBITDA, a measure of segment performance in accordance with ASC 280, is defined as pretax earnings of a reportable segment before depreciation, depletion and amortization, and excludes the following items the Company does not consider part of our segment performance: gain on sale of certain closed facilities, multiemployer pension withdrawal income, restructuring and other costs, impairment of goodwill and other assets, non-allocated expenses, interest expense, net, loss on extinguishment of debt, other income (expense), net, and other adjustments - each as outlined in the table on page 6 (""Adjusted EBITDA""). The composition of Adjusted EBITDA is not addressed or prescribed by GAAP.Adjusted Segment Sales and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Excluding Trade SalesWestRock uses the non-GAAP financial measures ""Adjusted Segment Sales"" and ""Adjusted EBITDA Margin, excluding trade sales"". Management believes that adjusting segment sales for trade sales is consistent with how our peers present their sales for purposes of computing segment margins and helps WestRock’s management, board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others compare companies in the same peer group. Management believes that the most directly comparable GAAP measure to ""Adjusted Segment Sales"" is ""segment sales"". Additionally, the most directly comparable GAAP measure to ""Adjusted EBITDA Margin, excluding trade sales"" is ""Adjusted EBITDA Margin"". ""Adjusted EBITDA Margin, excluding trade sales"" is calculated by dividing that segment’s Adjusted EBITDA by Adjusted Segment Sales. ""Adjusted EBITDA Margin"" is a profitability measure in accordance with ASC 280, and it is calculated for each segment by dividing that segment’s Adjusted EBITDA by segment sales.Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted ShareWestRock uses the non-GAAP financial measures ""Adjusted Net Income"" and ""Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share"". Management believes these measures provide WestRock’s management, board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate WestRock’s performance because they exclude restructuring and other costs, impairment of goodwill and other assets, business systems transformation costs and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the business. WestRock and its board of directors use this information to evaluate WestRock’s performance relative to other periods. WestRock believes that the most directly comparable GAAP measures to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share are Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and Earnings (loss) per diluted share, respectively.Adjusted Net DebtWestRock uses the non-GAAP financial measure ""Adjusted Net Debt"". Management believes this measure provides WestRock’s board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate WestRock’s repayment of debt relative to other periods because it includes or excludes certain items management believes are not comparable from period to period.

Westrock is a leading producer of packaging and paper with a broad portfolio of corrugated and consumer packaging, product displays and kraft paper with operations based in the U.S. and Latin America. Westrock has grown primarily through acquisitions, and debt levels have crept up over time. In March of 2021, a new management team came onboard, and they have been working to improve returns on capital by shutting down older mills and installing new, more efficient machines for products going into growing markets. Several competitors have announced they will be adding capacity in the next few years by converting old newsprint facilities to kraft paper and corrugated production. While management has shown resolve in taking aggressive actions to improve Westrock’s return profile, we believe that current market conditions will make it difficult for them to earn long-term returns that meet our objective. We decided to reallocate the capital to other businesses that we believe have much better return profiles than Westrock.""Story continues5 Biggest Packaging Companies in the USWestRock Company (NYSE:WRK) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

For fiscal 2024, the company anticipates revenues to be modestly down to flat year over year, driven by the persistent weakness in its wholesale business and a longer-than-expected turnaround for Vans. The company’s wholesale business, mainly in the U.S., remains challenging as its major partners are having a more cautious approach on forward orders. Vans performance is also concerning.However, the North Face and China business have been experiencing momentum. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is also seeing an improved performance in the supply chain, allowing it to capitalize on revenue opportunities. It has also been managing costs and inventory position. Overall, management expects a better second-half revenue performance with respect to the first half on improving wholesale performance, moderating declines at Vans and easing year-over-year comparisons.For fiscal 2024, the bottom line is envisioned to be $2.05-$2.25 per share. It anticipates free cash flow to be about $900 million.Key PicksSome better-ranked companies are Royal Caribbean RCL, lululemon athletica LULU and Ralph Lauren RL.Royal Caribbean sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

Inflation has declined over the past 12 months, which has now made the Fed sound a lot more confident about the economy having a softer landing than expected earlier.At the same time, personal income and spending have been rising steadily over the past few months. Higher personal income is leading to increased spending, which is being driven by higher demand for goods and services. Given this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in discretionary stocks like Reynolds Consumer Products Inc. REYN, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCLH, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL and Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. LYV.Purchasing Power GrowsThe Commerce Department said on Jul 28 that personal income rose 0.3% in June on a month-over-month basis. Although growth was slightly lower than the economists’ expectations of a rise of 0.5%, personal income has been increasing steadily over the past few months.Simultaneously, the Commerce Department said that personal spending grew 0.5% month over month in June.The report came just two days after the Fed hiked interest rates by 25 basis points for the 11th time since March 2022 after leaving rates unchanged in June. This takes the federal funds rate to the range of 5.25% to 5.5%, its highest level in over 22 years.The July interest rate hike was widely expected as the Fed had indicated that two more interest rate hikes would be required by the end of this year.However, positive inflation data has raised hopes that the Fed could soon end its current monetary tightening cycle as it, too, now believes that the economy might have a softer landing.Inflation has been steadily declining over the past year. The Commerce Department said that Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation increased 2.6% in the second quarter, while core PCE inflation rose 3.8% over the same period. The figures are proof that inflation has been cooling after it increased 4.1% and 4.9%, respectively, in the first quarter.Story continuesThe headline PCE inflation rose a modest 3% year over year in June, its lowest level since March 2021. Also, U.S. GDP increased 2.4% in the second quarter, signaling a slow but steady recovery.Personal income and spending have been climbing as the labor market is resilient despite the Fed’s aggressive rate hike stance. Although the employment rate has somewhat slowed, the economy is witnessing solid job additions, which was 290,000 in June.Higher consumer spending also saw retail grow 0.2% in June. Thus, companies in the consumer discretionary sector are expected to benefit as inflation cools further and personal income grows as it will boost spending. This is because consumers are likely to have more discretionary income, which can be allocated toward non-essential purchases.Our ChoicesTherefore, from an investment perspective, we have identified four stocks from the consumer discretionary sector that are likely to capitalize on reduced inflationary pressure. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Reynolds Consumer Products Inc. is a consumer-branded and private-label products company.

The metric increased 6% on a year-over-year basis.

Now, I will turn the call over to Tony.Tony Capuano: Thanks, Jackie, and thank you all for joining us today. Our terrific second quarter results demonstrate the strength of global lodging demand and the success of our growth strategies. I've experienced a robust demand for lodging firsthand as I've been on the road a lot this year and have had the privilege of visiting every one of our regions. It has been wonderful to spend time with our team of hard-working and dedicated associates at properties around the world and to see how quickly global travel has rebounded. Second quarter worldwide RevPAR rose 13.5% versus the 2022 quarter, led by another quarter of meaningful recovery in Greater China. Less than two quarters after travel restrictions were lifted, RevPAR in Greater China has now surpassed 2019 levels, primarily due to the surge in domestic demand.Story continuesWorldwide occupancy in the quarter reached 72%, five percentage points higher than the year ago quarter. With our unwavering focus on maximizing revenues, global ADR grew 6% year-over-year. Global leisure demand and ADR remained robust. Second quarter leisure transient room nights and ADR each increased 5% year-over-year, yielding 10% revenue growth. In the US and Canada, leisure revenues rose 1% above last year's sensational second quarter. Demand in this market has been stabilizing on a year-over-year basis with travelers from the region increasingly taking vacations overseas now that pandemic-related travel restrictions are behind us. Leisure room nights from the US and Canadian travelers jumped 90% in Asia Pacific and over 20% in Europe compared to the same period last year.The group segment had another great quarter with revenues in the US and Canada growing 10% year-over-year, driven by both rate and occupancy. Group revenues are expected to remain strong going forward. At the end of June, group revenue for the back half of 2023 was pacing up 11% to last year. Meeting planners are beginning to book further out, a trend we're also seeing with transient customers. Group revenue for full year 2024 was pacing up 14% year-over-year at the end of the quarter, an improvement from up 9% just three months prior. Recovery in business transient demand remained slow, but steady with demand from our top corporate accounts progressing modestly in the quarter. In the US and Canada, ADR again rose nicely compared to 2022, thanks to high single-digit special corporate rate increases.This led to business transient revenues rising 12% year-over-year. Overall, cross-border travel demand also rose again in the quarter, primarily driven by an increase in international visitors to the Asia-Pacific region. The percent of total room nights from cross-border guests is now roughly one percentage point below 2019 levels of approximately 20%. Prior to the pandemic, international visitors accounted for nearly one quarter of room nights in Greater China. With the region's international airlift still only around 40% of 2019 capacity at the end of the second quarter, we believe there is still meaningful growth opportunity in and from Greater China. We remain keenly focused on strengthening our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, which has over 186 million members.To further build engagement, we continued to enrich the platform with an enhanced booking experience, more choices for customers, and complementary products that drive more value and capture share of wallet, such as our co-branded credit cards and travel insurance. Our international credit cards had a record quarter, driving global card acquisitions up 25% and global card spend up 10% versus the year ago quarter. We are increasingly leveraging technology to enhance the guest experience, to drive profitability for our owners and to simplify processes for our associates. As we've mentioned previously, we are in the process of a major global transformation of our digital and core technology. We will be launching new reservations, loyalty and property management platforms over the next several years and look forward to the numerous capabilities these new systems will offer our key constituents.As we focus on paths for growth, we are adding new offerings and experiences in segments where we believe there is strong consumer interest beyond our current brands. A great example is our recent announcement of an exclusive 20-year strategic license agreement with MGM Resorts International and the creation of MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy. The collection, which will launch beginning in October, encompasses 17 resorts with 40,000 rooms. This deal will provide us with significant presence in Las Vegas, one of the most popular destinations in the country with fantastic properties like Bellagio, the MGM Grand, and ARIA, as well as additional distribution in five other key US cities. Beyond just hotels, our strategic agreement with MGM will also give our members access to more sports, music, culinary and entertainment experiences.We also recently announced our plans of new affordable mid-scale extended stay offering in the U.S. and Canada. Our deep experience and leading position in extended-stay lodging, coupled with the recent trends toward increased work flexibility and longer stay travel, make us very optimistic about our growth potential. While it is still early days, initial interest from the development community has been extraordinary. We are working on several hundred deals and hope to have our first deal signed by the end of this year. In the Caribbean and Latin America, we're very excited about the recent addition of City Express to our brand lineup. These mid-scale properties have started to join our distribution channels, and we are thrilled with the noticeable uplift in conversion rates, ADR and bookings so far.20 Biggest Franchises In The WorldDoublePHOTO studio/Shutterstock.comOur development team remains focused on driving conversions, especially multiunit opportunities, and interest from owners remains robust. In the first half of this year, convergence accounted for 21% of our organic room additions, including MGM, and conversions represented 63% of our organic signings through June. The MGM rooms entering our system beginning this fall will boost our rooms distribution in 2023 by 2.4%. With more than half the year behind us, we have refined our full year net rooms growth expectations to 6.4% to 6.7%. Driving valuable global growth is a top company priority, and we are very pleased with the strong rate at which we expect our industry-leading system to grow this year. We look forward to sharing more about many key aspects of our business, including our broad global portfolio of over 30 brands, their exciting growth prospects all over the world, Marriott Bonvoy, the brand that brings it all together, our technology transformation and our multiyear financial model at our Investor Day on September 27.Now I'll hand the call over to Leeny to discuss our second quarter financial results in more detail as well as our updated outlook for 2023. Leeny?Leeny Oberg: Thank you, Tony. Our strong second quarter results reflected solid demand in ADR growth around the world with Greater China RevPAR more than doubling, international RevPAR rose an impressive 39% over the 2022 second quarter. Occupancy for our international regions reached 68%, a 12 percentage point improvement versus the prior year quarter and ADR increased 14%. RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada grew 6% versus the year ago quarter. Occupancy reached 74%, up 1 percentage point, while ADR increased 4%. While demand from both business and leisure guests remained strong, growth rates are stabilizing as we return to more normalized year-over-year comparisons. Total company's gross fee revenues totaled $1.25 billion, rising 16%, led by meaningful growth in incentive management fees or IMF.IMF totaled $193 million in the quarter, with fees in Greater China up significantly, given the strong recovery in that region. Impressively, our IMF in the first half of 2023 were 19% higher than peak IMF in the first half of 2018. Our owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses grew 24% despite lower termination fees, largely due to improved performance at our owned and leased hotels. Our strong IMF and owned, leased performance demonstrate our operating team's terrific work at driving profitability. Corporate G&amp;A rose to 4%, well-above the rate of top line growth with the strong operating leverage inherent in our business, adjusted EBITDA reached a record $1.2 billion, up an impressive 20% year-over-year. On the development front, we're closely monitoring the financing environment, which remains tight around the world.While the US and Europe are facing the most lending challenges, even in these markets, financing has not come to a standstill. Over the past few months, many owners in these regions have been able to secure financing and begin construction. In most of our other regions, there's much less dependence on debt financing for new deals, so hotel construction generally continues apace. Properties in our industry leading 547, 000 room pipeline that are already under construction continue to move forward. And we've not seen the number of deals leaving the pipeline increase. Global fallout in the quarter was 1.3%, below our historic quarterly average of just over 2%. Now let's talk about our 2023 outlook, the full details of which are in our earnings release.With the better than expected second quarter results and robust global booking trends, especially internationally, we're raising our full year guidance. While there is still a level of macroeconomic uncertainty, as we look into the third quarter, the consumer is generally holding up well and our forward bookings remain solid. In the US, it now seems more likely that the US economy could have a soft landing. Our updated guidance range assumes relatively steady global economic conditions throughout the remainder of 2023 with continued resilience of travel demand. Growth is expected to remain higher internationally than in the US and Canada, where we're seeing a return to more normal seasonal patterns and year-over-year RevPAR growth is stabilizing.For the full year, we now expect 7% to 9% RevPAR growth in the US and Canada. We're raising our expectation for international RevPAR growth to 28% to 30%, leading to an expected 12% to 14% increase in global RevPAR. Total fees for the full year could rise between 16% and 18% with the non-RevPAR related component increasing 4% to 7%. Non-RevPAR related fees are expected to benefit from higher credit card fees resulting from growth in average spend and in the number of cardholders. We still expect 2023 G&amp;A expenses of $915 million to $935 million, an annual increase of 3% to 5%, but still below 2019 level. Compared to 2022, full year adjusted EBITDA could increase between 18% and 21% and adjusted EPS could rise 25% to 29%. Our powerful asset-light business model continues to generate a large amount of cash.In the first half of this year, our net cash provided by operating activities surpassed $1.5 billion, nearly 50% higher than the same period last year. We've returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through June. With the increase in our adjusted EBITDA forecast, we now expect to return between $4.1 billion and $4.5 billion to shareholders in 2023. This assumes full year investment spending of $900 million to $1 billion, which includes the $100 million spent on the acquisition of the City Express brand portfolio. With our major technology transformation, we will also have elevated technology spending this year and over the next few years, though this investment is overwhelmingly expected to be reimbursed over time. Our capital allocation philosophy has not changed.We're committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value, while returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. Thank you for your interest in Marriott, and Tony and I are now happy to answer your questions.See also 12 Best Bargain Stocks to Buy in August and 11 Self-Made Female Billionaires Under 50.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

While buyers had fewer for-sale options, with active inventory 49.2% below typical pre-pandemic July levels, the market tipped slightly in their favor as the median list price declined year over year (-0.9% to $440,000) for the second month in a row.""While a second monthly year-over-year decline in list prices bodes well for potential buyers, the ongoing lack of homes available for sale continues to prop up home prices and will keep declines relatively modest for the remainder of the year,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""Interest rate hikes continue to further cut into buyers' purchasing power, although they appear to have adapted to the higher mortgage rate environment faster than sellers, many of whom are still on the sidelines, locked in to lower interest rates and unwilling to cash in their home's equity to purchase another. That's putting a damper on home sales, which will likely post their smallest annual tally this year in over a decade.""July 2023 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over July 2022Change over July 2019Median listing price-0.9% (to $440,000)+37.7 %Active listings-6.4 %-47.8 %New listings-20.8 %-27.1 %Median days on market+11 days (to 45 days)-12 daysShare of active listings with price reductions-3.6 percentage points (to 15.5%)-2.2 percentage pointsHome listing inventory crunch intensifies as fewer sellers enter the marketGrowth in the U.S. inventory of active listings slowed for four months in a row, and in July, declined compared to the previous year for the first time since early 2022. That means today's buyers have significantly fewer options to choose from compared to one year ago – on a typical day in July there were 45,000 fewer homes available to buy. With interest rates on track to remain elevated for the remainder of the year and homeowners choosing to sell in lower numbers than has been typical in recent years, the stock of homes for sale is expected to remain low in the coming months.Story continuesIn July, the U.S. inventory of active listings slowed for the fourth month in a row and decreased -6.4% compared to July 2022; the decline was the first since April 2022. Inventory is 49.2% below typical July pre-pandemic levels.Both newly listed homes (-20.8%) and pending listings (-12.6%), or homes under contract, declined year over year. July's decline in pending listings is smaller than June's -16.7% decline and much improved from December's peak decline (-36.9% year over year).Active inventory decreased in 38 out of 50 of the largest metros compared to last year. Only the Southern region saw inventory grow, up +2.8% year over year, led by New Orleans (+39.6%), San Antonio (+34.5%) and Memphis, Tenn. (+33.2%).In July, none of the 50 largest metro areas saw new listings increase over the previous year. Declines were greatest in Phoenix(-44.3%) Seattle (-38.4%) and San Jose, Calif. (-35.3%).Home listing prices decline but mortgage rates keep purchase costs highIn July, national median list prices declined slightly year over year for the second month in a row. Despite the dip, the low supply of homes for sale and a resilient labor market are expected to keep upward pressure on prices this year, as will still-high buyer demand. The housing market continues to generally move faster than it did in the pre-pandemic era despite significant slowing from the frenzied pace of the past few years; while time on market is up slightly from last year, the share of homes with price reductions is down from last July.For the second month in a row, the U.S. median list price declined slightly (-0.9% year over year) to $440,000 in July, down from $445,000 in June. The median list price is down -2.0% from its record high of $449,000 in June 2022.Higher mortgage rates compared to July of last year increased the monthly cost of financing 80% of the typical home by roughly $346 (+17.5%) compared to a year ago.Nationally, the share of homes with price reductions decreased from 19.1% in July 2022 to 15.5% this year. The share of price reductions remains below typical levels seen in 2017 to 2019.The typical home spent 45 days on market in June, 11 days longer than this time last year, but 12 fewer days than they typically did in the average June 2017–2019.Across the 50 largest U.S. metros, in July the typical home spent 39 days on the market, 8 days more than the previous July. Time on market increased the most in Miami (+24 days), Austin, Texas (+20 days), San Antonio (+19 days), and Raleigh, N.C. (+19 days)Spotlight On: A rising number of buyers are looking for homes in other marketsWith rising rates and still-high home prices, the number of home shoppers searching for homes in areas other than where they live continues to rise. Realtor.com®'s Q2 Cross-Market Demand Report, also released today, found that Western shoppers are most likely to look for out-of-market homes, but Northeastern shoppers are catching up – that region saw the highest growth this quarter. While home shoppers show the greatest preference for searching for homes in nearby metros or states, long-distance home searching sometimes pairs unexpected cities, such as from San Francisco to Chicago and Chicago to Dallas. In Q2 2023, 60.3% of all Realtor.com® listing views from the Top 100 metros went to homes located outside the metro areas where shoppers live, up 0.7 percentage points from Q1 2023 and 4.1 percentage points year over year.Regionally, Western home shoppers (67.7%) were most likely to look for out-of-market homes in Q2, but Northeastern shoppers (59.9%) are catching up. Northeastern shoppers saw the highest growth in Q2, when the share of out-of-market shopping was 5.5 percentage points higher than the prior year.In all four regions, more than half of online shopping traffic went to homes outside of the shoppers' metro areas. Only the Western region had this level of outside shopping interest three years ago.Chicago has been the top out-of-state destination for home shoppers based in San Francisco for the past four quarters, likely because of its relatively affordable housing, similar tech/industry structure and easy access to transportation. Similarly, Dallas serves as the metro pair for Chicago for shoppers seeking tech jobs, easy air transportation and warmer weather.Tampa, Fla. is a metro pair for multiple metros in New York and Ohio, including Akron, Cincinnati and Cleveland in Ohio and Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse in New York. Las Vegas is urban Honolulu's metro pair, Phoenix is Portland, Ore.'s metro pair, and Miami is New York City's metro pair.""Housing affordability isn't likely to improve anytime soon, so it's not surprising to see that Americans are on the move and increasingly searching for homes in more affordable areas of the country where they can stretch their housing dollars further,"" said Jiayi Xu, Realtor.com®  Economist.

The articles paint a picture of Mr. Heppner as a leader who exploited investors which, according to the lawsuit, includes falsehoods published with “actual malice.”A spokesperson for The Wall Street Journal, owned by News Corp, declined to comment as did Beneficient. News Corp has extensive ties to the Murdoch family including Rupert Murdoch who is executive chairman. The suit against Mr. Gladstone was filed by Clare Locke, a firm that sued Fox News in the voting machine scandal around the 2020 election that recently resulted in a $787.5 million settlement. Mr. Murdoch is also chair of Fox News parent Fox Corp. (The two companies split apart roughly a decade ago).Mr. Gladstone didn’t reply to a request for comment from IPO Edge.Story continuesOne aim of the lawsuit is to address a “false narrative” around legacy transactions, in particular an investment in the business from another company called GWG Holdings that was characterized as “Heppner’s takeover.” The suit says that the deal with GWG was made at arms length with approval from a special committee that didn’t include Mr. Heppner.The lawsuit says it was not Mr. Heppner’s deal as Mr. Gladstone suggests but was struck “as part of a larger strategy to diversify before Heppner became chairman of GWG’s board” at a time when Mr. Heppner “never had control or approval rights” and had no say in who was appointed to the GWG board.Furthermore, the suit says GWG invested in Beneficient “as part of a publicly disclosed business strategy, and GWG’s investment in Beneficient, at the time of Gladstone’s Article and tweet, was worth substantially more than the principal invested.”The suit goes on to emphasize that Beneficient attempted to share accurate information with Mr. Gladstone that he chose not to use. “When Gladstone asserted pre-publication that Beneficient ‘need[ed] to take that $230 million from GWG[,]’ he was explicitly contradicted by Plaintiffs’ representatives and warned the description was factually inaccurate—instead, the transaction described was an investment for value—and warned that the assertion that Beneficient ‘took’ money from GWG supported a false narrative,” the suit says.Beneficient is a technology-based platform designed to help medium-to-high net worth individuals and smaller institutions exit illiquid positions in alternative assets like private equity, which typically lock up investor money for a decade or so. Ben has taken steps to streamline the process so investors can apply for a quote entirely online – much like a car insurance quote on a standardized form. The tech allows Ben to offer liquidity in transactions as small as $100,000 – far below typical transactions that occur now.Needless to say, financial innovation can compel companies to navigate complex rules and regulations. Beneficient has two former Federal Reserve Presidents on its board: Richard Fisher of Dallas and Dennis Lockhart of Atlanta – both of whom have extensive experience in the world of money and banking.Contact: IPO-Edge.com Editor@IPO-Edge.com Twitter: @IPOEdge Instagram: @IPOEdge ]"

This decrease might be attributed to the evolving competitive landscape and industry challenges.Growth in broadband and wirelessWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with VZ. Click here to check it out. VZ 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VZDespite the revenue setback, Verizon experienced noteworthy growth in its broadband sector, adding 418,000 net subscribers, including a significant increase in fixed wireless and Fios product demand. Notably, Fios internet net additions surged from 36,000 in the prior-year quarter to 54,000, underscoring a positive trajectory.The telecom company reported a 3.8% increase in total wireless service revenue, amounting to $19.1 billion. This was supported by 8,000 postpaid phone net additions and 612,000 retail postpaid net additions. The consistent growth in postpaid phone gross additions, primarily driven by consumer demand, contributed to these gains. Additionally, the company's retail postpaid churn rates stood at 1.07% overall and 0.83% specifically for retail postpaid phones, highlighting relatively stable customer retention.Verizon: Resilience and Growth in a Dynamic LandscapeSource: Q2 2023 Earnings ReviewProjections for 2023Looking forward, Verizon Communications' projections for 2023 point to a continued focus on growth. The company anticipates wireless service revenue to grow between 2.5% and 4.5%, demonstrating confidence in its ability to capture market share. Adjusted Ebitda is expected to range between $47 billion and $48.5 billion, while adjusted earnings per share is forecasted to be between $4.55 and $4.85, slightly below the consensus estimate of $4.68.This projection underscores Verizon's commitment to profitability and financial stability.Story continuesMoreover, Verizon's capital spending plans remain consistent as it expects to invest between $18.25 billion and $19.25 billion. This capital allocation reflects its strategic approach to maintaining and enhancing its infrastructure, supporting its service quality and expansion initiatives. A notable highlight was the company's strong free cash flow performance, reaching $8 billion for the first half of the year, which represented a substantial increase from the previous year. This growth was attributed to efficient working capital management and lower capital expenditures.Operational efficiency and cost savingsOn the other hand, Verizon's operational efficiency initiatives were reflected in a 5.9% year-over-year reduction in operating expenses (excluding depreciation, amortization and special items). This was attributed to cost-savings programs and organizational optimization. Through transformation efforts, the company aims to achieve annual cost savings of $2 billion to $3 billion by 2025.Despite facing industry challenges, including the investigation into lead-sheathed cables in the telecom industry, Verizon's results demonstrate resilience and strategic foresight. The company's efforts to expand its broadband subscriber base, improve wireless service revenue, manage costs and optimize cash flow position it well for continued growth and adaptation in the dynamic telecommunications landscape.The cable issueVerizon Communications faces significant challenges due to the U.S. Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency's investigations regarding lead-covered telecom cables, which are centered on potential health and environmental risks.Verizon and AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) have been directed to provide inspections and environmental data within 10 days. While Verizon claims low exposure risk due to cable location, it acknowledged ongoing third-party testing and emphasized its commitment to addressing concerns.Notably, the financial implications still need to be determined. The extent of cable with lead sheathing must be fully documented due to incomplete historical records. Verizon's assertion that the cables are typically in locations with minimal public contact mitigates the immediate risks.As the issue may impact Verizon's market valuation in the coming weeks, value investors can benefit from the lows until it hits a historical support level near $25.Verizon: Resilience and Growth in a Dynamic LandscapeVerizon's emerging bullish fundamentalsThe company is breeding strong growth potential and adaptability in a dynamic market, positioning itself as a leading player in the 5G arena. The company's focus on strategic initiatives, such as accelerating growth, enhancing operations and maintaining a solid balance sheet, has yielded positive results. Despite economic uncertainties, Verizon's performance underscores its ability to innovate and excel.Consumer wireless strategy and broadband growthVerizon's consumer wireless strategy, emphasizing segmentation and financial discipline, has proven to be effective in the mobility sector. Launching myPlan, a tailored offering, has driven higher average revenue per account and encouraged customers to opt for premium plans. Notably, the company's C-band deployment has contributed to significant growth in postpaid phone gross adds and lower churn rates in markets where it was introduced.Additionally, Verizon's growth extends to private networks, where it secured a mandate from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and launched a cutting-edge private networking solution at the Cleveland Clinic. This positions it favorably to tap into the expanding market for private wireless solutions.Verizon's strategy has resulted in consistent net additions in the broadband domain, with over 400,000 new subscribers for multiple consecutive quarters. The success of fixed wireless access is evident, with the company on track to reach 4 million to 5 million subscribers by 2025, a substantial increase from the current base of nearly 2.3 million. The company's ability to segment the fixed wireless market based on pricing and speed tiers provides customers with more options.Network quality and upcoming infusionFurther, Verizon's focus on network quality is evident through numerous accolades, including J.D. Power's recognition for the 31st time as the most-awarded brand for wireless network quality. The upcoming infusion of the C-band spectrum further enhances its network capabilities, enabling dedicated 5G services to a diverse customer base.Global servicesFinally, Verizon Global Services is also capitalizing on opportunities by focusing on IT platform transformation, utilizing artificial intelligence, optimizing real estate and enhancing supply chains. These measures are expected to result in significant cost savings, strong cash flow, continued investment in the business and dividend increases.ConclusionIn conclusion, Verizon Communications remains on track to achieve its financial guidance in 2023. With a robust operational blueprint, innovative offerings and a customer-centric approach, the company is well-positioned for sustainable growth and continued leadership in the telecommunications industry. Despite macroeconomic challenges, its ability to adapt, innovate and execute its strategic initiatives underscores its resilience and potential for value creation.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to our cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.Story continuesDonald Allan: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Stanley Black &amp; Decker's second quarter performance represented strong execution across the organization, driving significant progress towards our business transformation objectives on multiple fronts. Before I get into the results, I am extremely pleased to welcome Chris Nelson to our leadership team and we have him joining us on the call for Q&amp;A today. Chris started in June as our Chief Operating Officer and President of our Tools and Outdoor business. Chris is an experienced global business leader with strong industry knowledge and a successful track record of implementing growth strategies, which have delivered customer-centric innovation and profitable market share expansion.I'm excited to see Chris assume leadership of the Tools and Outdoor business. He is bringing new energy and perspective, which will further position us for strong execution and faster profitable growth. Welcome, Chris. With this critical appointment, Stanley Black &amp; Decker's senior leadership team is now in place. Together we will bring our shared vision to life, optimizing the company around our core businesses and strong portfolio of global brands, as we execute our strategy to generate sustainable growth and margin expansion. As you'll hear from Pat in a few moments, our cost and supply chain optimization program is ahead of plan to the first six months of 2023 and building momentum. The compelling long-term growth opportunities in the markets we serve combined with the progress we've made transforming our business, including our improved cost position, gives us the confidence to pursue further growth investments in the second half of this year.Deploying these growth investments as part of our $300 million to $500 million target over the next three years is intended to accelerate market share gains. As we drive these investment priorities, we are also maintaining our commitment to return value to our shareholders. And to that end, our Board of Directors approved a modest increase to our quarterly cash dividend amounting to $0.81 per share. Shifting now to our second quarter performance. We demonstrated that we are continuing to advance our transformation journey and ahead of the planned program. Specifically, we reduced inventory by nearly $400 million in Q2, which brings our aggregate program to date reduction to $1.4 billion since mid-2022. Our Global Cost Reduction Program delivered $230 million of pre-tax run-rate savings in the quarter, on track for the expected $1 billion in annualized savings by the end of this year.Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 23.6%, a sequential improvement of 50 basis points, our second consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. And all of these actions translated into $200 million of free cash flow in Q2. Second quarter revenue was $4.2 billion which was down versus the prior year due to lower consumer Outdoor and DIY volume, as rising interest rates have tempered consumer spending in addition to the negative year-over-year impact of the oil and gas divestiture completed last year. That said, demand remains solid for the professional side of the market, which represents roughly 70% of our Tools business. As it relates to the end markets, the US retail point-of-sale for our Tools and Outdoor products remained in a growth position this quarter versus 2019 levels, bolstered by price and healthy pro demand.Both Tools and Outdoor POS through the first four weeks of July is growing versus prior year, a potentially positive signal for the back half of 2023. We're also encouraged by a stabilizing residential construction market, despite the rising interest-rate cycle. US homes starts are running at a pace of 1.4 million units in June, a strong signal that demand for housing remains sound. This is complemented by US permits to build single-family homes rising to a one-year high and positive trend in housing completions. Additionally, contractor backlog in the US remains healthy for repair and remodel activity. The European markets are experiencing similar trends with softer DIY markets balanced with a healthier level of construction activity and professionals with backlogs through the end of this year.And then finally, our channel partners continued to be focused on optimizing inventory levels and we expect that to be a modest headwind throughout 2023. Across our Industrial end markets, we are seeing continued strength in global automotive and aerospace. So while the end markets across Stanley Black &amp; Decker remain relatively stable with pockets of strength, we are monitoring the demand environment and continue to plan for a range of outcomes and we will respond accordingly if we see current trends shift. Operationally, we continue to be focused on the prioritization of inventory reduction and cash generation, with 2Q adjusted diluted EPS coming in at a loss of $0.11 which was better than our plan. Due to the solid progress we have made on our key financial goals in the first half, we are narrowing our 2023 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $0.70 up to $1.30 and narrowing our free cash flow range to $600 million to $900 million.Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. Now let me walk through the details of our business segment performance. Beginning with Tools and Outdoor, total revenue was $3.5 billion down 5% organically versus prior year, that favourable price realization was more than offset by volume decline. We continue to make progress on the Tools and Outdoor adjusted operating margin, which was 4.5% up 150 basis points sequentially driven by benefits from volume leverage and cost control versus prior year our operating margin rate was down as price realization was more than offset by selling through high-cost inventory, planned production curtailment costs and lower volume. I would now like to provide some more detail on our various Tools and Outdoor geographies.North America was down mid-single-digits organically weighted by lower consumer Outdoor and DIY tool demand as well as modest customer destocking. Organic revenues were stronger sequentially as we lap tougher comparables and saw benefits from better order fill rates with our customers while leveraging strength and professional demand. Our European revenue was down 1% organically with bright spots in the UK and Southern regions as they both posted high-single-digit organic growth. The emerging markets' performance was down 3% organically. However, when you exclude the impacts from our Russian business exit, the remaining countries had high-single-digit organic growth. This was led by strong demand in Brazil, particularly within the professional channels.Moving to our strategic business unit performance, we experienced an Outdoor organic revenue decline of 12%. As widely reported by many in this industry, the challenging start to the outdoor season persisted for the entire season. And we did experience notable softness in POS and replenishment in the quarter especially surrounding higher price point retail products. The hand tools business was flat organically versus prior year and overcame softer DIY volume with international growth and certain categories strength. Notably, DEWALT storage solution growth including the expanded softline and TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 portfolio offerings introduced earlier this year. Power tools declined 4% organically as softer consumer market demand persisted and customers remain cautious with inventory levels.This result was notably better than the first quarter as we saw continued Pro momentum, coupled with positive impacts from a healthier supply chain, leading to better service levels and increased promotional opportunities, particularly with DEWALT and CRAFTSMAN. Now shifting to our industrial business, which had 3% organic growth in the quarter. The total segment revenue declined 5% versus 2Q 2022 as price realization was more than offset by last year's oil and gas divestiture and currency. We improved the adjusted operating margin by 370 basis points versus prior year, including continued price realization and cost actions to deliver adjusted operating margin of 13%. This represents strong execution and a great financial outcome this quarter for our industrial team.Within this segment Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 8%, including aerospace growth of 31% and auto growth of 15% as we captured cyclical rebounds in these markets along with share gains. This favourable performance was partially offset by industrial fastening and attachment tools' organic revenue declines, primarily as a result of customers destocking to optimize their inventory levels. While long-term fundamentals for growth remain solid, we believe temporary channel inventory reductions will continue to impact these industrial businesses in the second half of the year as well. In summary, the team continues to navigate market conditions with several pockets of strength in a few areas of pressure while we continue to improve our margins.I want to thank the entire Stanley Black &amp; Decker organization for your focus on our key priorities. The progress to date is very encouraging and energizing as we take the next several steps of our business transformational journey. Turning to the next slide. I would like to underscore the importance of the strategy that we launched a year ago to transform Stanley Black &amp; Decker to accelerate market share gains and drive consistent organic growth. Our teams around the world are gaining traction and executing on our primary areas of focus. One, streamlining and simplifying the organization as well as shifting resources to prioritize investments that we believe have a positive and more direct impact for our end-users and various channel customers.Two, accelerating the operations and supply chain transformation to return adjusted gross margins to historical 35% plus levels, while improving fill rate to better match inventory with customer demand. Three, prioritizing cash flow generation and inventory optimization. And four, continuing to advance innovation, electrification, and global market penetration to achieve organic growth of two times to three times the market. Our business transformation is our path to continuing to enhance our customer and end-user experiences while delivering on our financial commitments and enabling the pursuit of strategic growth investments behind our iconic brands, innovation engine, electrification and commercial activation. Key investments in innovation, coupled with market activation are being accelerated to maximize the impact of our product launches with our global customers and end-users.For example, our fully integrated CRAFTSMAN campaign was built to drive traffic to our key retail partners, instant repeat purchases, and engage new users. To-date, we've shown strong initial results breaking through the industry clutter. Since the campaign launched in the second quarter, we've driven both online and offline traffic to retail and demonstrated improved tools point-of-sale run-rate versus the prior year to support brand market share growth. We're excited to see continued positive momentum from this exciting CRAFTSMAN brand campaign. We are also leveraging the strength of our DEWALT brand with a Pro-inspired product roadmap to expand core innovation as we released enhanced product offerings to improve the End-User experience. We recently launched two new DEWALT Sealed Head Ratchets.Construction and extractionCopyright: Kurhan / 123RF Stock PhotoThe 20-volt MAX XR as well as the extreme 12-volt MAX options, delivering power, versatility, and durability engineered with the professional in mind, particularly, automotive, electrical, and mechanical tradespeople. The innovative design meets the needs of Pros across industries on any job site. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR Brushless Cordless Rivet Tools were also introduced this quarter. Design for precision fastening and pre-fabrication, assembly, HVAC, roofing, and automotive applications. These tools have features such as on-board nose piece storage and a mandrel collector to catch rivets after each shot. Lastly, we introduced a new DEWALT 25-foot LED tape measure, a great example of core innovation within our Tough Series product line.Our engineering team continues to advance our innovation roadmap with best-in-class products and solutions for our end-users as we electrify and enhance safety on the job site as well as push the balance of power and performance across our categories. Let me now turn the call over to Pat to share the latest progress updates and our transformation, financial insights on the quarter and our latest outlook.Patrick Hallinan: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Don mentioned, we made meaningful progress on our transformation in the quarter and first half of the year. Our cost reduction program is on track to deliver $1 billion of pre-tax run-rate savings in 2023 and is modestly ahead of plan year-to-date. Our simplification and prioritization efforts coupled with our supply chain transformation delivered $230 million of run-rate savings in the second quarter totaling $460 million year-to-date and $660 million since program inception. Approximately half of our 2023 savings were manufacturing costs related and as such we'll begin to see these benefits turn through inventory, off the balance sheet, and on to the P&amp;L starting in the second half and continuing to build in 2024.Our organization is bringing our vision for the supply chain of the future to life with persistent sustainable progress. Strategic sourcing is a major contributor of 2023 savings and is ahead of plan. We have the capabilities in place to ensure changes are executed successfully and we are currently activating additional RFPs to secure further savings. The momentum behind the SBD operating model along with lean manufacturing practices is yielding sustainable productivity efficiencies such as alleviating manufacturing bottlenecks as well as reducing process waste and production downtime. This will become an important source of savings in the coming months and quarters. Our manufacturing and logistics network optimization remains on track, as we work to improve the efficiency and utilization of the asset base.Finally, as it relates to our complexity reduction, the SKU rationalization initiative is progressing in an orderly fashion. At this stage, we have approved the reduction of approximately 70,000 SKUs. We are working with our customers to assist with their transition to replacing products over the coming quarters. We have now decommissioned over 20,000 SKUs. We believe that as we exit the remaining 50,000 offerings, we will have suitable substitutes that will mitigate effectively all of the potential revenue risks which we size at less than 50 million annually. We believe managing this in a methodical way creates value via complexity reduction, without undue disruption to our customers or loss of share. We are pleased with the progress of our global cost reduction program and are confident in our ability to capture $1 billion of run-rate savings by the end of 2023 and $2 billion of run-rate savings by the end of 2025.Turning to our inventory reduction progress and gross margin trajectory. In the second quarter, we reduced inventory by $375 million bringing our year-to-date progress to $575 million. Over the last 12 months, we've achieved approximately $1.4 billion in inventory reduction through the improved supply chain conditions and planned production curtailments instituted during the back half of 2022. To contextualize our first-half performance, the $575 million reduction compares favourably to the average pre-pandemic first-half inventory build of approximately $400 million. We are expecting our full-year 2023 inventory reduction to be between $700 million and $900 million, which represents the DSI, that is about a 155 days. We remain committed to ongoing inventory productivity improvement to generate cash flow that will be used to strengthen our balance sheet while supporting our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends.Turning to gross margin. The pace of improvement has been modestly ahead of expectations as transformation execution and freight deflation are favourable to plan. Second quarter adjusted gross margin was 23.6%, up 50 basis points sequentially versus the first quarter of 2023, the impact from liquidating high-cost inventory and the production curtailments represented approximately 400 basis points to 500 basis points of margin headwinds in the second quarter. Moving forward, we expect continued sequential improvement in adjusted gross margin driven by a lower impact from turning high-cost inventory and an increased benefit as our cost transformation improves the P&amp;L. Assuming the demand levels and other assumptions that underpin our guidance, we expect adjusted gross margin to be 27% to 29% in the second half, a strong improvement versus recent quarters.While this is a significant step up from the front-half performance, we have line-of-sight into the cost-savings already generated and on the balance sheet that corresponds to lower-cost of sales and margin improvement in the coming quarters. To conclude, we're starting to reap the benefits from the inventory reductions and supply chain transformation and we'll remain focused on delivering our targeted adjusted gross margin of 35% plus by 2025. Now turning to 2023 guidance. Our expected GAAP earnings per share range has been narrowed to negative $1.25 to negative $0.50 from negative $1.65 to positive $0.60, inclusive of one-time charges, primarily from the global supply chain transformation and outdoor integration. The current pre-tax charges estimate was narrowed to $300 million to $325 million with approximately 25% of these expenses being non-cash.The 2023 quarterly profile of GAAP taxes and GAAP earnings per share is significantly impacted by the pre-tax loss in the first half and the interim tax impact of certain benefits factored into our annual effective tax rate assumption. However, as we expect to generate pre-tax income in the second half. This interim tax benefit will reverse and we expect our full-year tax rate to be relatively consistent with prior guidance. In parallel, we are also narrowing our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $0.70 to $1.30 from our previous guidance range of zero to $2. We are keeping the $1 midpoint consistent with the prior guidance framework versus our previous expectation, we have assumed modestly lower organic growth offset by better gross margin.At the midpoint, this results in an improved full-year adjusted operating profit and margin. This stronger operating performance is offset by an approximate $0.25 impact from higher interest and other expenses below the line, of which, 40% to 50% is interest-rate driven. We are narrowing our full-year free cash flow range to $600 million to $900 million from $500 million to $1 billion. We expect second half cash flow to be supported by positive net income, a further reduction in inventory, and the normal Tools and Outdoor seasonal benefit from working capital. We are planning for total company organic growth to be down mid-single-digits for the year. In terms of the business segment outlook, Tools and Outdoor total organic revenue is expected to be down mid-to-high single-digits for the year, incorporating the softer outlook in Outdoor as well as expectations for continued DIY softness and channel inventory conservatism.We are expecting to regain Cordless Power Tool promotions in the second half, reflecting our improved supply position. And as such, pricing is assumed to be relatively flat to slightly negative consistent with these activities. We continue to see the Pro tool user holding strong. And at this point, we believe the range of outcomes for volume covers some variability for the US consumer and DIY demand balance with the potential for stronger professional demand in the back half. In Industrial, we expect flat to low-single-digit organic growth on a full-year basis supported by a cyclical rebound in aerospace and auto. This is modestly lower than our prior outlook as we incorporate an assumption for continued customer destocking in attachment tools and industrial fastening.Production normalization and the pace of growth investments will both be flexed based on demand. We are planning for production to normalize in the fourth quarter recognizing the lower volume. We remain disciplined and flexible in our approach to reinvesting to drive organic growth. Our focus is to deliver on our financial expectations while utilizing gross margin improvements to fund growth investments. Our outlook assumes approximately $125 million of annualized investment with a goal to ultimately deploy $300 million to $500 million over the next three years. Clearly, our willingness to invest increases as we progress along our gross margin expansion trajectory. We expect second half adjusted operating margins to be in the mid-to-high single-digit as our cost efficiencies offset volume pressures.Turning to the important remaining elements of guidance. The expectation for the third quarter would be a sequential improvement in operating profit, primarily from the benefits of our cost reduction initiatives and a lesser impact from destocking. Adjusted EPS for the third quarter is planned to be approximately 80% of the full-year adjusted EPS amounts. And due to losses within the first half, the back-half adjusted EPS will be more than a 100% of the full-year total adjusted EPS. So in summary, we are exiting the first half with strong momentum across our cost-savings and cash generation initiatives with some of the more significant impacts from our inventory reduction now in the rear-view mirror, we are focusing on driving the items within our control to deliver further margin improvement and to fund investments.We continue to manage the business with the long-term in mind and we believe we have the right strategy in place to successfully navigate our path forward as we remain focused on driving above-market organic growth with margin expansion and enhance shareholder returns. With that, I will now pass the call back over to Don.Donald Allan: Thank you, Pat. We are pleased to report another quarter of meaningful progress related to our transformation journey. Successful execution against our plan gives us the confidence to increase our focus on reinvestment toward faster growth as we fuel our team with more resources to unleash the power of our amazing brands, strengthen the innovation machine, and stimulate demand with enhanced end user activation. We believe our actions to reshape, focus and streamline our organization as well as reinvest in our core businesses will enable us to deliver significant shareholder value over the long term via robust organic growth and enhanced profitability. I am proud to be alongside the best people, the best brands, and the most powerful innovation engine in our industry. As we continue to focus on what we can control to be successful, I am confident that we are recreating a significant market share gaining machine. With that, we are now ready for Q&amp;A, Dennis.Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start Q&amp;A, please.

Additional information regarding these measures and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP historical results can be found below. In addition, as discussed below, it is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to identify the timing or occurrence of future events, transactions, and/or investment activity that could have a significant effect on the Company's future GAAP EPS or cash flow used for investing activities if any of these events were to occur.Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported third quarter fiscal 2023 results, including GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $2.67, up two percent from prior year. The current year includes an unfavorable $0.30 per share impact from business and asset actions as well as costs for the non-service related components of the Company's defined benefit pension plans, both of which are reflected as adjustments in the non-GAAP measures discussed below. GAAP net income of $611 million was up four percent as higher pricing and higher equity affiliates' income more than offset higher costs. GAAP net income margin of 20.1 percent increased 170 basis points over the prior year, which also included a positive impact from lower energy cost pass-through due to declining energy prices.For the quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.98 increased 16 percent over the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion was up 12 percent as higher pricing and higher equity affiliates' income more than offset higher costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 39.8 percent increased 590 basis points over the prior year, which also included a positive impact from lower energy cost pass-through.Third quarter sales of $3.0 billion decreased five percent over the prior year as four percent higher pricing and three percent higher volumes were more than offset by 11 percent lower energy cost pass-through and one percent unfavorable currency.Commenting on the results, Air Products' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Seifi Ghasemi said, ""The committed, motivated and talented people of Air Products once again delivered excellent results for the quarter. Pricing and volumes were up in every region. We generated significant free cash flow, and we continue to successfully execute our megaprojects to decarbonize the world. Based on this performance, we have again increased our guidance for the full year. I would like to thank our employees for their dedication and hard work.""Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Results by Business Segment Americas sales of $1.3 billion were down 11 percent versus the prior year, as six percent higher volumes and four percent higher pricing were more than offset by 21 percent lower energy cost pass-through. Operating income of $375 million increased 25 percent and adjusted EBITDA of $568 million increased 18 percent, in each case due to higher pricing and higher volumes, partially offset by higher costs. Operating margin of 29.7 percent increased 860 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.0 percent increased 1,110 basis points, driven primarily by lower energy cost pass-through.Asia sales of $823 million increased 10 percent over the prior year, as eight percent higher volumes, four percent higher pricing and three percent higher energy cost pass-through more than offset five percent unfavorable currency. Operating income of $241 million increased 14 percent and adjusted EBITDA of $357 million increased 10 percent, in each case due to the favorable volumes and pricing, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts and higher costs. Operating margin of 29.3 percent increased 130 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin of 43.3 percent increased 20 basis points.Europe sales of $707 million decreased four percent from the prior year, as six percent higher pricing, two percent favorable currency and one percent higher volumes were more than offset by 13 percent lower energy cost pass-through.

Operating margin of 24.9 percent increased 630 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin of 35.9 percent increased 790 basis points, driven primarily by higher pricing and lower energy cost pass-through.Middle East and India equity affiliates' income of $96 million increased 42 percent compared to the prior year, primarily due to the second phase of the Jazan project, which was completed in January 2023.Corporate and other sales of $204 million decreased 17 percent compared to the prior year, driven by lower sale of equipment activity.OutlookAir Products provides adjusted EPS guidance on a continuing operations basis, excluding the impact of certain items that management believes are not representative of the Company's underlying business performance, such as the incurrence of costs for cost reduction actions and impairment charges, or the recognition of gains or losses on certain disclosed items. It is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to predict the timing or occurrence of these events or the potential for other transactions that may impact future GAAP EPS. Similarly, it is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to reconcile forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities because management is not able to identify the timing or occurrence of future investment activity, which is driven by management's assessment of competing opportunities at the time the Company enters into transactions. Furthermore, it is not possible to identify the potential significance of these events in advance, but any of these events, if they were to occur, could have a significant effect on the Company's future GAAP results. Management therefore is unable to reconcile, without unreasonable effort, the Company's forecasted range of adjusted EPS or capital expenditures to a comparable GAAP range.Air Products expects increased full-year fiscal 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of $11.40 to $11.50, up 11 to 12 percent over prior year adjusted EPS. For the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter, Air Products' adjusted EPS guidance is $3.04 to $3.14, up seven to 10 percent over fiscal 2022 fourth quarter adjusted EPS.Effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, management reviews adjusted EPS excluding the impact of non-service related components of the net periodic benefit/cost for the Company's defined benefit pension plans. The projected percentage increase in adjusted EPS for full year fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2023 fourth quarter is calculated using recast fiscal 2022 results to provide a consistent basis for comparison. Refer to the reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP historical results below for additional information.Air Products continues to expect capital expenditures of $5.0 billion to $5.5 billion for full-year fiscal 2023.Earnings TeleconferenceAccess the fiscal 2023 third quarter earnings teleconference scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on August 3, 2023 by calling 323-994-2093 and entering passcode 3546489 or by accessing the Event Details page on Air Products' Investor Relations website.About Air ProductsAir Products (NYSE:APD) is a world-leading industrial gases company in operation for over 80 years focused on serving energy, environmental, and emerging markets.

Income$644.2$627.4$1,756.0$1,712.3 RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(Millions of U.S. Dollars unless otherwise indicated, except for per share data)We present certain financial measures, other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""), on an ""adjusted"" or ""non-GAAP"" basis. On a consolidated basis, these measures include adjusted diluted earnings per share (""EPS""), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, and capital expenditures. On a segment basis, these measures include adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. In addition to these measures, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to help the reader understand the impact that certain disclosed items, or ""non-GAAP adjustments,"" have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted EPS. For each non-GAAP financial measure, we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.In many cases, non-GAAP financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP measure to exclude non-GAAP adjustments that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance. For example, we exclude the impact of the non-service components of net periodic benefit/cost for our defined benefit pension plans as further discussed below. Additionally, we may exclude certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions, impairment charges, and gains on disclosed transactions. The reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future.When applicable, the tax impact of our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments. These tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.We provide these non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others to evaluate the performance of our business in the same manner as our management. We believe these measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. However, we caution readers not to consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP financial measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTSBusiness and Asset ActionsOur consolidated income statement for the three months ended 30 June 2023 reflects a charge of $59.0 ($51.2 attributable to Air Products after tax, or $0.23 per share) for strategic business and asset actions intended to optimize costs and focus resources on our growth projects. The charge, which was not recorded in segment results, included a noncash charge of $32.0 to write off assets related to our exit from certain projects previously under construction as well as an expense of $27.0 for severance and other benefits associated with position eliminations and the restructuring of certain organizations.Non-service Pension Cost (Benefit), NetEffective beginning in fiscal year 2023, our adjusted EPS excludes the impact of non-service related components of net periodic benefit/cost for our defined benefit pension plans. The prior year non-GAAP financial measures presented below have been recast accordingly to conform to the fiscal year 2023 presentation. Non-service related components are recurring, non-operating items that include interest cost, expected returns on plan assets, prior service cost amortization, actuarial loss amortization, as well as special termination benefits, curtailments, and settlements. The net impact of non-service related components is reflected within ""Other non-operating income (expense), net"" on our consolidated income statements. Adjusting for the impact of non-service pension components provides management and users of our financial statements with a more accurate representation of our underlying business performance because these components are driven by factors that are unrelated to our operations, such as recent changes to the allocation of our pension plan assets associated with de-risking as well as volatility in equity and debt markets. Further, non-service related components are not indicative of our defined benefit plans' future contribution needs due to the funded status of the plans.ADJUSTED DILUTED EPSThe table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, which we view as a key performance metric. In periods that we have non-GAAP adjustments, we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of each such adjustment because management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance. Per share impacts are calculated independently and may not sum to total diluted EPS and total adjusted diluted EPS due to rounding.Three Months Ended 30 JuneQ3 2023 vs. Q3 2022OperatingIncomeEquity Affiliates' IncomeOther Non-Operating Income/Expense, NetIncome Tax ProvisionNet Income Attributable to Air ProductsDilutedEPSQ3 2023 GAAP$644.2$165.0($11.7)$139.6$595.6$2.67Q3 2022 GAAP627.4116.110.5134.2582.12.62$ Change GAAP$0.05% Change GAAP2 %Q3 2023 GAAP$644.2$165.0($11.7)$139.6$595.6$2.67Business and asset actions59.0——7.851.20.23Non-service pension cost, net——22.05.416.60.07Q3 2023 Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$703.2$165.0$10.3$152.8$663.4$2.98Q3 2022 GAAP$627.4$116.1$10.5$134.2$582.1$2.62Non-service pension benefit, net——(9.5)(2.3)(7.2)(0.03)Q3 2022 Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$627.4$116.1$1.0$131.9$574.9$2.58$ Change Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$0.40% Change Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")16 % ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGINWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income less income from discontinued operations, net of tax, and excluding non-GAAP adjustments, which we do not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, other non-operating income (expense), net, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful metrics for management to assess operating performance.

Beginning in fiscal year 2023, we adjust capital expenditures to exclude NEOM Green Hydrogen Company (""NGHC"") spending reflected in ""Additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits"" that is ultimately funded through our joint venture partners' equity contributions to NGHC as well as non-recourse project financing obtained by NGHC. We believe adjusting for NGHC expenditures not funded by Air Products' equity to arrive at capital expenditures provides users of our financial statements with a better understanding of the investment on which we expect to make a return.A reconciliation of cash used for investing activities to our reported capital expenditures is provided below:Nine Months Ended30 June20232022Cash used for investing activities$4,399.8$2,844.1Proceeds from sale of assets and investments13.332.8Purchases of investments(443.4)(1,247.9)Proceeds from investments766.02,219.2Other investing activities4.86.9NGHC expenditures not funded by Air Products' equity(656.0)—Capital expenditures$4,084.5$3,855.1The components of our capital expenditures are detailed in the table below:Nine Months Ended30 June20232022Additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits$3,163.5$2,139.1Acquisitions, less cash acquired—65.1Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates912.01,650.9Investment in financing receivables665.0—NGHC expenditures not funded by Air Products' equity(656.0)—Capital expenditures$4,084.5$3,855.1Outlook for Investing ActivitiesIt is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to reconcile our forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities because we are unable to identify the timing or occurrence of our future investment activity, which is driven by our assessment of competing opportunities at the time we enter into transactions. These decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could have a significant effect on our cash used for investing activities.We expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023 to be $5.0 billion to $5.5 billion.OUTLOOKThe guidance provided below is on an adjusted continuing operations basis and is compared to adjusted historical diluted EPS attributable to Air Products. These adjusted measures exclude the impact of certain items that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance, such as the non-service components of net periodic benefit/cost for our defined benefit pension plans, the incurrence of costs for business, asset, and cost reduction actions and impairment charges, or the recognition of gains or losses on certain disclosed items. The per share impact for each of our non-GAAP adjustments is calculated independently and may not sum to total adjusted diluted EPS due to rounding.It is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to identify the timing or occurrence of similar future events or the potential for other transactions that may impact future GAAP EPS. Furthermore, it is not possible to identify the potential significance of these events in advance; however, any of these events, if they were to occur, could have a significant effect on our future GAAP EPS. Accordingly, management is unable to fully reconcile, without unreasonable efforts, our forecasted range of adjusted EPS on a continuing operations basis to a comparable GAAP range.Diluted EPSQ4Full Year2022 Diluted EPS$2.56$10.08Business and asset actions0.270.27Equity method investment impairment charge0.050.052022 Adjusted Diluted EPS$2.89$10.41Per share impact of non-service pension benefit, net(A)(0.04)(0.15)2022 Adjusted Diluted EPS, excluding per share impact of non-service pension benefit, net(A)$2.85$10.252023 Adjusted Diluted EPS Outlook(A)$3.04–$3.14$11.40–$11.50$ Change(A)0.19–0.291.15–1.25% Change(A)7%–10%11%–12%(A) Fiscal year 2022 diluted EPS has been adjusted as illustrated and as discussed in the Adjusted Diluted EPS Reflecting Adjustments for Non-Service Pension Impacts section below in order to present fiscal year 2022 results and fiscal year 2023 guidance on a consistent basis.

The International Energy Agency estimates that the cost of producing hydrogen from renewable electricity could fall 30% by 2030. This factor alone is a big trigger for scaling up the hydrogen economy. With some bullish estimates on growth, it’s a good time to accumulate some of the best hydrogen stocks.To put things into perspective, the global hydrogen market is expected to reach $317.39 billion by 2030. Some of the early movers in the industry will be best positioned to gain. Investors need to be selective as the big market potential has resulted in several players entering the hydrogen business.This column focuses on three companies that are positioned to make it big in the coming years. Further, these represent millionaire maker hydrogen stocks likely to deliver multibagger returns.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s discuss the reasons to be bullish.Plug Power (PLUG)Person holding cellphone with logo of American hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc on screen in front of web page Focus on phone displaySource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.comPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) stock has corrected by 25% in the last 12 months. Fresh accumulation can be considered before the next rally commences on the back of ambitious growth plans.As an overview, Plug Power claims to be building an end-to-end hydrogen ecosystem. If the company’s ambitious plans are executed, the stock is poised to be a multi-bagger.To put things into perspective, Plug Power expects revenue of $1.2 to $1.4 billion for 2023. The company has guided to boost revenue to $5 billion by 2025 with an operating margin of 17%. Revenue is further expected to increase to $20 billion by 2030 with an operating margin of 20%. If this target is achieved, I believe that PLUG stock can be 10x or 15x in the next five to seven years.Of course, to achieve this target, Plug Power would need to dilute equity. I however don’t see that as a concern if the company’s plans remain on track in terms of timely execution.Story continuesAir Products and Chemicals (APD)A 3D illustration of hydrogen molecules.Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) is among the best hydrogen stocks to consider at current levels. The stock looks attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 26.5 and offers a robust dividend yield of 2.3%.A major reason to like Air Products is the company’s high financial flexibility. In the last 12 months, the company reported a distributable cash flow of $3.2 billion. Post dividends, the company’s investible cash flow stands at $1.7 billion. It’s not surprising that Air Products has planned some big investments in the hydrogen business.As an example, the company will be investing $4.5 billion to build-own-operate the world’s largest blue hydrogen production facility. This asset will be operational by 2026. The company has also created a joint venture in Saudi Arabia, NEOM Green Hydrogen Company. This JV closed an investment of $8.4 billion this year for the world’s largest green hydrogen facility.The key point is that Air Products is positioned to make some big investments in the next few years. This will help the company emerge as one of the leading hydrogen companies globally.Bloom Energy (BE)BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockBloom Energy (NYSE:BE) is another attractive name among millionaire-maker hydrogen stocks to buy. BE stock has been largely sideways in the last 12 months and a breakout on the upside seems imminent.RBC recently initiated a “buy” rating on the stock with a target price of $24. This would imply an upside potential of 34% from current levels. Of course, over a time horizon of five years, multi-bagger returns seem likely.A potential game changer for the company is its solid oxide hydrogen fuel cell technology. The fuel cell has already been deployed in 100s of applications across industries. This includes healthcare, data centers, critical manufacturing, retailers, among others. The addressable market is therefore significant and I expect the company to benefit.An important point to note is that the company expects to commercialize its solid oxide electrolyzer for large projects in 2024 and beyond. This is likely to support accelerated revenue growth.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The articles paint a picture of Mr. Heppner as a leader who exploited investors which, according to the lawsuit, includes falsehoods published with “actual malice.”A spokesperson for The Wall Street Journal, owned by News Corp, declined to comment as did Beneficient. News Corp has extensive ties to the Murdoch family including Rupert Murdoch who is executive chairman. The suit against Mr. Gladstone was filed by Clare Locke, a firm that sued Fox News in the voting machine scandal around the 2020 election that recently resulted in a $787.5 million settlement. Mr. Murdoch is also chair of Fox News parent Fox Corp. (The two companies split apart roughly a decade ago).Mr. Gladstone didn’t reply to a request for comment from IPO Edge.Story continuesOne aim of the lawsuit is to address a “false narrative” around legacy transactions, in particular an investment in the business from another company called GWG Holdings that was characterized as “Heppner’s takeover.” The suit says that the deal with GWG was made at arms length with approval from a special committee that didn’t include Mr. Heppner.The lawsuit says it was not Mr. Heppner’s deal as Mr. Gladstone suggests but was struck “as part of a larger strategy to diversify before Heppner became chairman of GWG’s board” at a time when Mr. Heppner “never had control or approval rights” and had no say in who was appointed to the GWG board.Furthermore, the suit says GWG invested in Beneficient “as part of a publicly disclosed business strategy, and GWG’s investment in Beneficient, at the time of Gladstone’s Article and tweet, was worth substantially more than the principal invested.”The suit goes on to emphasize that Beneficient attempted to share accurate information with Mr. Gladstone that he chose not to use. “When Gladstone asserted pre-publication that Beneficient ‘need[ed] to take that $230 million from GWG[,]’ he was explicitly contradicted by Plaintiffs’ representatives and warned the description was factually inaccurate—instead, the transaction described was an investment for value—and warned that the assertion that Beneficient ‘took’ money from GWG supported a false narrative,” the suit says.Beneficient is a technology-based platform designed to help medium-to-high net worth individuals and smaller institutions exit illiquid positions in alternative assets like private equity, which typically lock up investor money for a decade or so. Ben has taken steps to streamline the process so investors can apply for a quote entirely online – much like a car insurance quote on a standardized form. The tech allows Ben to offer liquidity in transactions as small as $100,000 – far below typical transactions that occur now.Needless to say, financial innovation can compel companies to navigate complex rules and regulations. Beneficient has two former Federal Reserve Presidents on its board: Richard Fisher of Dallas and Dennis Lockhart of Atlanta – both of whom have extensive experience in the world of money and banking.Contact: IPO-Edge.com Editor@IPO-Edge.com Twitter: @IPOEdge Instagram: @IPOEdge ]"

Robinson's new CEO had his first earnings call with analysts. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)The C.H. Robinson second-quarter earnings report and call with analysts was a time to review another three months of weak performance and also introduce new CEO Dave Bozeman to the analyst and investor community.Similar to the performance at 3PL rival RXO, C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW) recorded a second quarter that was significantly worse than a year earlier. But unlike RXO, Q2 saw weakening from the first three months of the year.In the key North American Surface Transportation (NAST) sector at C.H. Robinson, total revenues declined to $3 billion in the second quarter, down from $3.3 billion in the first. Adjusted gross profits fell to $400 million from $426.6 million, while income from operations slid to $117.9 million from $134 million.The adjusted operating margin for the NAST sector was 29.4% in the quarter. During the question-and-answer portion of the call, CFO Mike Zechmeister said the target adjusted operating margin for NAST is 40%, “and it’s been out there for quite a while.”“We feel really good about the progress that we’ve made on productivity,” Zechmeister said. He said C.H. Robinson’s goal was to improve shipments per day at NAST by 15% by the end of the year, and that figure already was up 12% halfway through 2023.Breaking the results down by adjusted gross profit in individual service lines, the second quarter was worse than the first. Adjusted gross profits, a non-GAAP measure, declined to $261.1 million for truckload operations, down from $288.6 million in the first quarter. LTL adjusted gross profit was mostly flat at $137.2 million, down from $138.7 million.Overall, the second quarter adjusted operating margin on $4.42 billion in revenue and $665.5 million in adjusted gross profit resulted in a 19.9% operating margin, down 360 basis points from the first quarter and down a whopping 2,560 bps from the second quarter of 2022.Other year-on-year comparisons were universally bleak. Gross profits of $656.7 million, a GAAP measurement, were down 35.9% from a year ago. Income from operations at $132.6 million was lower by 71.8%. Cash generated by operations was down $40.4 million to $224.8 million.Story continuesBut the Q&amp;A part of the call, the first for Bozeman since the former Ford executive was named CEO, was an opportunity for analysts to probe him about some of his conclusions about the company since he took over the corner office on June 26.Bozeman made an opening statement. “When I look at C.H. Robinson, I’m excited about the potential benefits from generative AI in conjunction with the machine learning and artificial intelligence that the company has already been utilizing,” he said.C.H. Robinson has “more data in history to leverage than any other 3PL and we have opportunities to harness the power that these advanced technologies now offer to further capitalize on our information advantage.”Bozeman, asked by several analysts about his long-term plans for the company, avoided specifics, instead laying down a more general philosophy.He said he had been traveling throughout the C.H. Robinson network of offices and that what surprised him was that the company’s level of technology — reportedly an issue that helped lead to the ouster of his predecessor, Bob Biesterfeld — was far better than he expected.“This is a company that is really on the leading edge with technology and then adding scale to it,” Bozeman said. But he added that his interactions had led him to “see the waste so you can fix [it], fix it fast and take this waste out.“That’s why I feel so happy about where we are, and eventually when this upturn comes where we’ll be from a positioning perspective.”He brought up the pace of change in answer to a separate question. “The focus is around driving waste out with the end game of profitable growth and really getting the organization to latch on to faster speed of decisions and speed of innovation,” Bozeman said. “And, ultimately, looking around corners to set itself up for what is going to be an eventual turnaround and that’ll put us in a very strong position with our scale and our balance sheet.”The question of “speed” came up several times during Bozeman’s comments. “We’re going to be laser-focused on speed,” he said. “It is imperative.” Improving that “clock speed” will be possible as “the company continues to use technology as an enabler with its people.”C.H. Robinson already has gone through rounds of layoffs this year and in late 2022. Zechmeister, in response to an analyst’s question, said head count at the 3PL is down 13% year over year, and that the cutbacks aren’t done. But he added that the second half of 2023 won’t see “nearly as dramatic reductions as we saw in the first half.”Head count stood at 15,763 at the end of the second quarter.Zechmeister, echoing Bozeman, said improvements could come from other areas. The cutbacks in personnel are an “accelerant,” he said, but the combination of machine learning and generative AI can “find the exceptions in the work that our people have been handling here historically.”“Now with generative AI, we’ve got the ability to do that in a more automated way and really enable our folks,” Zechmeister said.Reviewing the market conditions that C.H. Robinson faces, he said the company’s prices received in the quarter were down 23% while costs came down just 19%. “That’s margin compression for us,” he said, but added that “it’s not what we would expect going forward. But that’s the point in the cycle that we’re at right now.”Ultimately, he said, “truckload price follows costs, and that gets right to the root of the issue for us here in the second quarter and probably in the third.”While costs have been going down, the truckload line-haul cost per mile started to level off in May and June, Zechmeister said. The end result is that the cost per mile at the end of the quarter was just 2 cents less than where it was at the end of the first quarter.More articles by John KingstonTeamsters celebrate NLRB decision on STG Logistics, see path to greater unionization Uber Freight’s EBITDA loss widens from ’22 but improves from Q1Yellow elephant in the room for Saia’s Q2 earnings callThe post C.H.

Robinson's recently appointed President and Chief Executive Officer, Dave Bozeman, said, ""It is an absolute privilege to be leading C.H. Robinson, a market leader with enormous scale, a strong base of loyal customers, and a resilient business model that generates profits and free cash flow through the entirety of the freight cycle.""The company noted that global freight markets in the second quarter continued to be impacted by weak demand, high inventories and excess capacity, which resulted in a more competitive marketplace with suppressed transportation rates. North American surface transportation volumes and load-to-truck ratios remain near the low levels of 2019. In the freight forwarding market, ocean vessel and air freight capacity continues to exceed demand, which has kept ocean and air freight rates low during this period of significant decline that has continued since the second half of 2022.""We are staying focused on what we can control, providing superior service to our customers and carriers and streamlining our processes by removing waste and manual touches,"" added Bozeman.Story continues""I know from my time in the transportation market that other freight providers and new entrants look to Robinson as an example of a commercial engine with the breadth, scale, expertise and financial strength that they aspire to achieve. However, there is always room for improvement, and I recognize the tremendous opportunity in front of us to accelerate growth in a very fragmented market. Our goal is to provide such a compelling offering that customers feel like C.H. Robinson is essential to the success of their supply chain.

Adjusted gross profits decreased 35.5% to $665.5 million, primarily driven by lower adjusted gross profit per transaction in truckload and ocean.Operating expenses decreased 5.2% to $532.9 million. Personnel expenses decreased 15.2% to $377.3 million, primarily due to cost optimization efforts and lower variable compensation. Average headcount declined 10.1%. Selling, general and administrative (""SG&amp;A"") expenses of $155.6 million increased 32.8%, primarily due to the $25.3 million gain on the sale-leaseback of our Kansas City regional center recorded in the prior year and increased claims and warehouse expenses in the current year.Income from operations totaled $132.6 million, down 71.8% due to the decrease in adjusted gross profits, partially offset by the decline in operating expenses. Adjusted operating margin of 19.9% declined 2,560 basis points.Interest and other income/expense, net totaled $18.3 million of expense, consisting primarily of $23.2 million of interest expense, which increased $6.3 million versus last year due to higher variable interest rates.

The lower rate in the second quarter of this year was driven by lower income before taxes, increased U.S. tax credits and incentives, fewer non-deductible expenses, and incremental benefits from foreign tax credit utilization.Net income totaled $97.3 million, down 72.1% from a year ago. Diluted EPS of $0.81 decreased 69.7%. Adjusted EPS of $0.90 decreased 64.3%.Summary of Year-to-Date Results Compared to 2022Total revenues decreased 33.6% to $9.0 billion, primarily driven by lower pricing in our ocean and truckload services.Gross profits decreased 30.7% to $1.3 billion.

Personnel expenses decreased 11.4% to $760.4 million, primarily due to cost optimization efforts and lower variable compensation. Average headcount declined 5.9%. SG&amp;A expenses increased 12.3% to $297.1 million, primarily due to the $25.3 million gain on the sale-leaseback of our Kansas City regional center recorded in the prior year and increased depreciation and amortization in the current year.Income from operations totaled $293.7 million, down 64.0% from last year, due to the decrease in adjusted gross profits, partially offset by the decline in operating expense. Adjusted operating margin of 21.7% decreased 2,040 basis points.Interest and other income/expense, net totaled $46.5 million of expense, which primarily consisted of $46.8 million of interest expense, which increased $15.3 million versus last year due to higher variable interest rates.

The difference between adjusted gross profits and gross profits is not material.Second quarter total revenues for the NAST segment totaled $3.1 billion, a decrease of 25.7% over the prior year, primarily driven by lower truckload pricing, reflecting an oversupply of truckload capacity compared to soft freight demand. NAST adjusted gross profits decreased 35.9% in the quarter to $400.5 million. Adjusted gross profits in truckload decreased 45.4% due to a 41.5% decrease in adjusted gross profit per shipment and a 6.5% decline in truckload shipments. Our average truckload linehaul rate per mile charged to our customers, which excludes fuel surcharges, decreased approximately 23.0% in the quarter compared to the prior year, while truckload linehaul cost per mile, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased approximately 19.0%, resulting in a 41.5% decrease in truckload adjusted gross profit per mile. LTL adjusted gross profits decreased 18.8% versus the year-ago period, as adjusted gross profit per order decreased 19.0% and LTL shipments were flat. NAST overall volume growth was down 2.5% for the quarter. Operating expenses decreased 18.8% primarily due to lower variable compensation and lower average employee headcount.

Managed Services adjusted gross profits increased 4.8% in the quarter, due to growth with existing and new customers. Other Surface Transportation adjusted gross profits decreased 5.7% to $18.9 million, primarily due to a 7.3% decrease in Europe truckload adjusted gross profits.Other Income Statement ItemsThe second quarter effective tax rate was 14.9%, down from 21.3% last year. The lower rate in the second quarter of this year was driven by lower income before taxes, increased U.S. tax credits and incentives, fewer non-deductible expenses, and incremental benefits from foreign tax credit utilization. We now expect our 2023 full-year effective tax rate to be 16% to 18%.Interest and other income/expense, net totaled $18.3 million of expense, consisting primarily of $23.2 million of interest expense, which increased $6.3 million versus the second quarter of 2022 due to higher variable interest rates, and a $3.5 million gain of foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses on intercompany assets and liabilities.Diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the quarter were down 8.1% due to share repurchases over the past twelve months.Cash Flow Generation and Capital DistributionCash generated from operations totaled $224.8 million in the second quarter, compared to $265.3 million of cash generated from operations in the second quarter of 2022. The $40.4 million decrease was primarily due to a $250.9 million decrease in net income, partially offset by a $143.7 million sequential decrease in net operating working capital in the second quarter of 2023 compared to a $45.3 million sequential increase in the second quarter of 2022. The decrease in net operating working capital in the second quarter of 2023 resulted primarily from a $180.0 million sequential decrease in accounts receivable and contract assets, partially offset by a $36.3 million sequential decrease in total accounts payable and accrued transportation expense.In the second quarter of 2023, cash returned to shareholders totaled $106.1 million, with $72.8 million in cash dividends and $33.4 million in repurchases of common stock.Capital expenditures totaled $24.4 million in the quarter. Capital expenditures for 2023 are expected to be $90 million to $100 million.About C.H. RobinsonC.H.

Adjusted gross profit is calculated as gross profit excluding amortization of internally developed software utilized to directly serve our customers and contracted carriers. We believe adjusted gross profit is a useful measure of our ability to source, add value, and sell services and products that are provided by third parties, and we consider adjusted gross profit to be a primary performance measurement.

(NYSE: CMI) today reported results for the second quarter of 2023.Second quarter revenues of $8.6 billion increased 31 percent from the same quarter in 2022. Sales in North America increased 31 percent and international revenues increased 32 percent due to the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most global markets.""Strong demand across most of our key markets and regions resulted in record revenues and solid profitability for the company in the second quarter of 2023,"" said Jennifer Rumsey, Chair and CEO. ""We are committed to delivering cycle-over-cycle improvement in financial performance, returning cash to our shareholders and prioritizing investments to continue building our product portfolio to power our customers’ success around the world. I want to thank our Cummins employees who continue to work tirelessly to meet customer needs and respond to the strong demand levels by ensuring quality products, strengthening our customer relationships, and navigating continued supply chain constraints.""Net income attributable to Cummins in the second quarter was $720 million, or $5.05 per diluted share compared to $702 million, or $4.94 per diluted share in 2022. Results included costs associated with the separation of Atmus of $23 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2023, and $29 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2022. The second quarter of 2022 also included $47 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, of benefit from adjusting the reserves related to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. The tax rate in the second quarter was 22.3 percent including $3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, of unfavorable discrete tax items.Story continuesEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in the second quarter were $1.3 billion, or 15.1 percent of sales, compared to $1.1 billion, or 16.0 percent of sales, a year ago. EBITDA for the second quarter of 2023 included the costs related to the separation of Atmus and the second quarter 2022 EBITDA included the reserve release related to the indefinite suspension of operations in Russia and costs related to the separation of Atmus as noted above. EBITDA percentage decreased in the second quarter principally due to the dilutive impact of Meritor, which currently has a lower gross margin percentage than our company average.2023 Outlook:Based on its current forecast, Cummins is maintaining its full year 2023 revenue guidance to be up 15 to 20 percent due to strong demand across most markets, especially North America. EBITDA is still expected to be in the range of 15.0 to 15.7 percent of sales.The outlook above includes the projected results of the Meritor business for 2023. The outlook assumes the inclusion of Atmus for the entirety of 2023, but excludes any costs or benefits associated with the planned separation of the business. Within the Components Segment, Cummins expects revenues of the Meritor business for 2023 to be between $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion and EBITDA to be in the range of 10.3 to 11.0 percent of sales, consistent with prior guidance.The company plans to continue to generate strong operating cash flow and returns for shareholders and is committed to our long-term strategic goal of returning 50 percent of operating cash flow back to shareholders. In the near term, we will focus on reinvesting for profitable growth, advancing dividends and reducing debt.""While we see demand remaining strong through 2023 and we are maintaining our guidance on revenue and profitability, we continue to closely monitor global economic indicators. Should economic momentum slow, Cummins will remain in a strong position to keep investing in future growth, bringing new technologies to customers as we advance our Destination Zero strategy, and returning cash to shareholders,"" said Rumsey.Recent Highlights:Progress continues to be made on the separation of the Filtration business. On May 26th, Atmus Filtration Technologies Inc. shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol ""ATMU"" in connection with the initial public offering (IPO). Upon completion of the IPO, Cummins retained approximately 80.5% of Atmus’ outstanding shares. The Atmus IPO generated $299 million of net proceeds and Atmus added $650 million of debt. Cummins realizes the benefits of the IPO proceeds and the debt issuance, as Atmus will hold the debt at full separation.Cummins announced two significant milestones with the 5 millionth engine produced at its Rocky Mount Engine Plant (RMEP) in North Carolina and the 2.5 millionth engine produced at its Jamestown Engine Plant (JEP) in New York. The 5 millionth milestone engine was a B6.7, which was received by Daimler, who provided it to Penske. The 2.5 millionth engine at JEP was the new 15-liter natural gas product and provided to Kenworth.On April 3rd, United States President Joe Biden visited company facilities in Fridley, Minnesota (USA), to tour Accelera by Cummins’ first U.S. manufacturing location for electrolyzers, a key technology to produce low- and no-carbon hydrogen. The official ribbon cutting on May 19th marked the start of electrolyzer production in the United States. Accelera is initially dedicating 89,000 sq. ft. of the existing Cummins power generation facility in Fridley to electrolyzer production.In the second quarter, Accelera reached a milestone of backlog electrolyzer orders totaling over $500 million. The Fridley facility will help address that growing demand along with other capacity being added globally.Cummins signed a definitive agreement with Tata Motors Limited (TML), to manufacture a range of low- to zero-emissions technology products in India over the next few years. As a part of this agreement, Cummins and TML have set up a new business entity called TCPL Green Energy Solutions Private Limited (GES), a wholly owned subsidiary under the existing joint venture with a focus on the development and manufacturing of sustainable technology products that will include hydrogen-powered internal combustion engines, fuel delivery systems, and battery electric powertrains and fuel cell electric systems through the Accelera™ by Cummins brand.Cummins received a 2023 Energy Management Insight Award from the Clean Energy Ministerial. The award recognizes organizations demonstrating the benefits of energy management systems and meeting the ISO 50001 international energy standard.Cummins announced an increase in the quarterly common stock cash dividend from $1.57 to $1.68 per share. The company has increased the quarterly dividend to shareholders for 14 consecutive years.1 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S.Second quarter 2023 detail (all comparisons to same period in 2022):Components SegmentSales - $3.4 billion, up 76 percentSegment EBITDA - $486 million, or 14.2 percent of sales, which includes $18 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus compared to $352 million, or 18.1 percent of sales, which includes $2 million of benefits from adjusting the reserves related to the indefinite suspension of operations in Russia. The decline in EBITDA percentage was driven primarily by the addition of Meritor, which has a dilutive impact on the segment despite its improvement in the second quarter.Revenues in North America increased by 70 percent and international sales increased by 84 percent due to the addition of Meritor and increased global demand.Engine SegmentSales - $3.0 billion, up 8 percentSegment EBITDA - $425 million, or 14.2 percent of sales, compared to $421 million or 15.2 percent of sales, which included $1 million of costs from the indefinite suspension of operations in RussiaOn-highway revenues increased 7 percent driven by strong demand in the North American truck market and pricing actions.Sales increased 7 percent in North America and grew 10 percent in international markets due to an increase in global demand.Distribution SegmentSales - $2.6 billion, up 15 percentSegment EBITDA - $299 million, or 11.5 percent of sales, compared to $297 million, or 13.2 percent of sales, a year ago when results included $45 million of benefits from adjusting the reserves related to the indefinite suspension of operations in RussiaRevenues in North America increased 20 percent and international sales increased by 5 percent.Higher revenues were driven by increased demand for whole goods, especially power generation products, and pricing actions.Power Systems SegmentSales - $1.5 billion, up 21 percentSegment EBITDA - $201 million, or 13.8 percent of sales, compared to $128 million, or 10.6 percent of sales, which included $1 million of benefit from adjusting the reserves related to the indefinite suspension of operations in RussiaSecond quarter results also included $18 million of costs related to severance costs related to transformation efforts within the segment.Power generation revenues increased 30 percent driven by increased global demand and pricing actions. Industrial revenues increased 9 percent due to increased demand in mining and oil and gas markets.Accelera SegmentSales - $85 million, up 102 percentSegment EBITDA loss - $114 millionRevenues increased due to higher demand for battery electric systems in the North American school bus market and the additions of the electric powertrain portion of the Meritor business and Siemens Commercial Vehicle business.Costs associated with the development of electric powertrains, fuel cells and electrolyzers, as well as products to support battery electric vehicles are contributing to EBITDA losses.

(Atmus) and Initial Public Offering (IPO)On May 23, 2023, in connection with the Atmus IPO, Cummins issued approximately $350 million of commercial paper with certain lenders. On May 26, 2023, Atmus shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""ATMU."" The IPO was completed on May 30, 2023, whereby Cummins exchanged 19.5 percent (approximately 16 million shares) of its ownership in Atmus, at $19.50 per share, to retire $299 million of the commercial paper as proceeds from the offering through a non-cash transaction.In connection with the completion of the IPO, through a series of asset and equity contributions, we transferred the filtration business to Atmus. In exchange, Atmus transferred consideration of approximately $650 million to Cummins, which consisted primarily of the net proceeds from a term loan facility and revolver executed by Atmus during May 2023.As we still own 80.5 percent of Atmus shares, it remains included in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.AcquisitionsHydrogenics CorporationOn June 29, 2023, a share purchase agreement was executed with a 19 percent minority shareholder in one of our businesses, Hydrogenics Corporation (Hydrogenics), whereby we agreed to pay the minority shareholder $335 million for their 19 percent ownership, including the settlement of shareholder loans of $48 million. As part of the share purchase agreement, Hydrogenics entered into three non-interest-bearing promissory notes with $175 million paid on July 31, 2023, and the remaining $160 million due in three installments through 2025.Teksid Hierro de Mexico, S.A. de C.V.On April 3, 2023, we acquired Teksid Hierro de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (Teksid MX) business for approximately $150 million, subject to working capital and other customary adjustments. Teksid MX operates a cast iron foundry located in Monclova, Mexico, which primarily forges blocks and heads used in our and other manufacturers’ engines. Teksid, Inc. facilitates the commercialization of Teksid MX products in North America.Meritor, Inc.During the second quarter of 2023, we finalized our accounting for the Meritor, Inc. acquisition. The primary components of the change were to increase contingent liabilities by $62 million offset by finalization of deferred taxes and tax reserves, with a net increase to goodwill of $26 million. There was no impact to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income for any of the changes.INCOME TAXESOur effective tax rate for 2023 is expected to approximate 22.0 percent, excluding any discrete items that may arise.Our effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2023, was 22.3 percent and contained net unfavorable discrete tax items of $3 million, or $0.02 per share.Our effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2023, was 22.0 percent and contained net discrete tax amounts of zero, as the result of offsetting amounts for the first two quarters, primarily due to share-based compensation tax benefits and other discrete items.Our effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2022, was 17.3 percent and contained favorable discrete tax items of $36 million, or $0.25 per share, primarily due to $36 million of favorable changes in tax reserves, $10 million of favorable changes associated with the indefinite suspension in our Russian operations and $8 million of net favorable other discrete tax items, partially offset by $18 million of unfavorable tax costs associated with internal restructuring ahead of the planned separation of Atmus.Our effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2022, was 21.1 percent and contained favorable discrete items of $5 million, or $0.04 per share, primarily due to $27 million of favorable changes in tax reserves and $4 million of net favorable other discrete tax items, partially offset by $18 million of unfavorable tax costs associated with internal restructuring ahead of the planned separation of Atmus and $8 million of unfavorable changes associated with the indefinite suspension in our Russian operations.CUMMINS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESFINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP(Unaudited)Reconciliation of Non GAAP measures - Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and noncontrolling interests (EBITDA)We believe EBITDA is a useful measure of our operating performance as it assists investors and debt holders in comparing our performance on a consistent basis without regard to financing methods, capital structure, income taxes or depreciation and amortization methods, which can vary significantly depending upon many factors. We believe EBITDA excluding special items is a useful measure of our operating performance without regard to the costs associated with the IPO and separation of Atmus and indefinite suspension of Russian operations. This statement excludes forward looking measures of EBITDA where a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of non-cash items that are excluded from the non-GAAP outlook measure.EBITDA is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. It should be considered supplemental data; however, the amounts included in the EBITDA calculation are derived from amounts included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income.

ConnectOne, Peapack-Gladstone, and Texas Capital saw declines in the month of March amid banking woes, but their shares have been on the mend since then. ""Those are nice conservative plays in the banking industry just in case things were to go wrong, these banks actually would do better when things go wrong because they're so strong in capital,"" Wiley says.Wiley advises investors to avoid Disney as the House of Mouse seems ""out of touch"" with their customers, the market, and the politics of their own state. Disney has entered into lawsuits against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis after he formed an advisory committee to revoke the theme park's special tax status. Lastly, Wiley finds EV maker Tesla to be a ""popularity stock"", likening it to a meme stock due to its high volatility, overvaluation, and ability to regularly go against the fundamentals.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Wall Street also walking back recession talk today. Economists at Bank of America saying that the US will not enter a recession and instead experience a soft landing. This comes after Fed staff also revised their projections saying something similar.So how should investors navigate their portfolios amid this reversal and also the turmoil that we're seeing play out in the markets today following the downgrade of US credit by Fitch? We want to talk about some picks and some stocks to avoid. For that, we have Dory Wiley, Commerce Street Capital CEO and president.Dory, it's good to see you here. So I think a lot of investors are trying to figure out where to place their money right now. Let's start with two of your picks, two smaller banks that you like, ConnectOne Bancorp and Peapack-Gladstone. What's the bull case for these two smaller banks?Story continuesDORY WILEY: Well, I think there's an industry play here and then a stock-specific play. On the industry of banking, I think you got to weigh in, dive in. You know, we're all cautious about commercial real estate refinance wave, asset liability risk, liquidity risk, et cetera as what happened in April over those kind of things. And the market's clearly telling us in July that it is. Banks have out rallied big tech and did very well in July.So I think there's some-- I would be real careful in what kind of banks got into. So these two picks I like a lot that are in the New York area and New Jersey. They're smaller community banks. They're picking up on the failures of Signature and First Republic and gathering business, but they're very strong banks as well. They're pushing 8 plus 9% capital, both about 25% to 30% more than the percentage capital that JP Morgan has.At the same time, they're extremely cheap trading very close to tangible book value. They got great management, great growth prospects. They're very conservative on their credit underwriting. And I think those are nice conservative plays in the banking industry just in case things were to go wrong. These banks actually would do better when things go wrong because they're so strong in capital.AKIKO FUJITA: Another name that you like, Texas Capital Bank shares, how does that fit into that checklist you just talked about, about which banks are positioned the best?DORY WILEY: Yeah, so Texas Capital I threw in there for the same reasons. They're very strong in capital. They came into this last year actually shrinking and changing their balance sheet, changing their strategy under a new management team.But because they're here in Texas and this economy is extremely robust here right now, they're really positioned more than I see a lot of banks that take advantage and grow should things get worse. If things just get better, then they should do fine, too. They just got to keep continuing this transformation that they're going through. And the market seems to be waiting to see if they can do this, but I think they're probably worth the bet that they can do this.They've got a really good quality people there. They've got a good management team. I expect them to do well. And they trade as cheap as any bank on the market right now pretty close to tangible book value. And they're running just under 10% tangible capital at the holding company, which is fantastic.SEANA SMITH: All right, so, Dory, you're seeing some opportunity in some smaller banks. Let's talk about what you're saying investors should avoid right now. And one of those names is a name that I think nearly everybody knows-- everybody knows and that's Disney. We're going to hear the results from Disney next week.Clearly, there's a lot of challenges when it comes to Bob Iger and what exactly he sees as the future of Disney right now. But what's your sell case? Why are you avoiding them at this point?DORY WILEY: Well, they seem, you know, very out of touch with the politics of their state. They seem to be out of touch with their customers. They seem to be out of touch with their market. And they seem to be losing their touch, you know.And it's one thing if you can still perform if you're going to isolate and, kind of, play politics, if you will, on the woke business, but they're putting out a stream of succession of movies that are starting to fail. They're just not doing very good. And so they're getting a track record of failure here that really concerns me.They've had trouble with a lot of cancellations in Disney Plus, a lot of controversy with the governor. I just think it's not a good thing to be caught up in when you've got all this turmoil at Disney. So I would avoid them for a while until they show me that they've got a smooth path to success.AKIKO FUJITA: And finally, another stock you don't like, Tesla. Is this a valuation concern? If so, at what price point would you get in?DORY WILEY: Oh, my gosh! I'm not sure you can value Tesla. You know, the thing is, is I hate to say anything negative about them because I'm actually become a reluctant fan of Elon Musk. And I really appreciate him honorably stepping up and being-- well, maybe being forced to do the Twitter deal and he's really going through some massive change. And actually, it's pretty incredible what he's been able to accomplish so far. So I wish him nothing but the best of success.But that stock is a-- you know, it's popularity stock. It's a trend stock. It doesn't trade on fundamentals. It's way overvalued.And so I just don't-- I don't play in Tesla. It's too volatile and it doesn't follow any fundamentals at all. It's a popularity contest or meme stock and I just stay away from it. I think it's dangerous.SEANA SMITH: Meme stock, all right. Dory Wiley, thanks so much for laying out your picks and your icks for us. We look forward to talking to you again soon.]"

My name is Gigi, and I'll be your event specialist today. (Operator Instructions) Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Andy Plenge, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours.Andrew C. PlengeThank you, Gigi, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to have you with us for our 2023 second quarter earnings call. Leading the call today are Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeanne Jones, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. Other members of Exelon senior management team are also with us today and they'll be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Today's presentation, along with our earnings release and other financial information can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. We would also like to remind you that today's presentation and the associated earnings release materials contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. You can find the cautionary statements on these risks on Slide 2 of today's presentation or in our SEC filings. In addition, today's presentation includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between these measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of our presentation and in our earnings release. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO.Story continuesCalvin G. ButlerThank you, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. We continued delivering on our plan as expected, which is a testament of all of the work put in by our dedicated employees. But before we get into our results and business updates, I'd like to first start by acknowledging a key milestone. In July, ComEd reached the end of the 3-year term of the deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice. At the court status hearing, the government moved to dismiss the charge, noting the company fully complied with the DPA, which the court granted in the hearing. We remain committed at all levels of the company to the highest standards of integrity and ethical behavior, and we look forward to building on the trust of our customers as we continue to move forward. In that spirit, I am pleased to welcome Anna Richo to our Board of Directors. Anna is the General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Corporate Secretary for Cargill, and she brings highly complementary experience as an attorney, and business leader. Her commitment to operational excellence and compliance will provide invaluable oversight. Now turning to the results for the quarter. As you can see on Slide 4, we earned $0.34 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.41 per share on a non-GAAP basis. These results are right in line with what we expected this quarter, and we remain on track to earn within our guidance range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share for 2023. We continue performing operationally at a very high level. Three of our 4 utilities had best on-record performance in outage frequency and outage duration, which I will touch on more on our next slide. We have also continued to progress through our rate case calendar with 6 active base rate cases underway in Illinois, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and the District of Columbia. Most recently, on May 16, we filed our second multiyear plan for Pepco Maryland, the climate ready pathway plan. The filing outlines Pepco's near-term proposal to advance the state's climate and clean energy goals, while taking steps to mitigate the impact of these efforts on customers' bills. The proposal includes over $150 million of climate solution programs to help Maryland meet its goals in the areas of transportation electrification, building decarbonization, beneficial electrification and distributed energy integration. It also includes a proposed performance incentive mechanism to focus on reliability, greenhouse gas emission reductions and removal of equipment posing health and environmental risk. We look forward to working through the process with stakeholders and the commission staff toward rates effective in the second quarter of 2024. Beyond Pepco Maryland, we have now received intervenor testimony in our BGE and ComEd multiyear rate plans and filed our rebuttals, and additional milestones await us in those cases in August, along with activity for Delmarva Delaware and Atlantic City Electric. The Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia has also set its schedule for the Pepco D.C. multiyear plan. You will hear more from Jeanne about all the work underway to align with our regulatory stakeholders. Now looking past 2023, we'll also remind you of the guidance we've previously provided on our long-term outlook. We expect to be at the midpoint or better of our 2021 to 2025 and 2022 to 2026, 6% to 8% annualized earnings growth ranges and to grow the dividend in line with those earnings. Over the next 4 years, we anticipate investing over $31 billion to support the energy transformation, which is what's driving that growth. And I'll remind you that we continue finding opportunities to further support the transformation, whether it's increasing affordability for customers or strengthening the durability of our long-term investment plans. For instance, we have talked about our efforts pursuing grants under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which support the investment programs we have laid out for the commissions. And we recently announced winning approximately $30 million of grant funding for middle mile broadband investments at BGE and ComEd. Additionally, you may have also seen that PJM recently voted to proceed with transmission upgrades to address reliability challenges associated with the retirement of the brand insurers coal plant in Eastern Maryland with over $850 million of work assigned to our utilities. Now while most of the incremental spend for that investment occurs beyond our current guidance window, it's a great illustration of how we continue to have opportunities to strengthen and lengthen our expected rate base growth as the largest pure T&amp;D utility in the United States. Our transmission upgrades ensure customers are able to buy cleaner generation and that they can depend on a reliable, resilient grid to deliver that power. Before I move on to operations, I want to mention that we published our latest Exelon Sustainability Report in mid-July. This is the 12th report in our company's history. We are incredibly proud of the work our organization puts into ensuring we are leading the energy transformation in an affordable and equitable manner. Our purpose, powering a cleaner and brighter future for our customers and communities, really shines through that report. And the progress we continue to make in fulfilling that purpose is meaningful. Here are a few examples. We have connected over 200,000 customers with over 3 gigawatts of renewable energy resources, a 16% increase over 2021. We saved close to 25 million megawatt hours in 2022 with our award-winning energy efficiency programs, a 9% increase that avoided 9.5 million metric tons of greenhouse gases and saved customers over $30 million at our average retail rate. Our support for diverse suppliers is now up more than 56% from 2018 levels, having spent $2.9 billion with such suppliers in 2022. Additionally, 62% of our $7.5 billion total supplier spend is with companies in the communities we serve. Our annual sustainability report illustrates all the ways in which our more than 19,000 employees ensure our communities greatly benefit from the work we are doing to support their energy transformation goals. Turning to Slide 5. I'll provide an update on our operating performance for the first half of the year. As it pertains to reliability, we continue setting the bar for performance. All 4 utilities operated in at least the top quartile, and ComEd, PECO and PHI achieved best on record outage frequency performance. That makes it the second quarter in a row for ComEd and PHI for best on record performance. Those 3 utilities also happen to achieve best on record system outage duration performance, and BGE continues to operate in the top quartile. Their performance illustrates that the investments we are making in the grid provide the footing for this operational excellence. And then it is up to our employees to rise to the challenge of keeping customers online or getting them back online as quickly as possible when outages do occur. Now that job is getting harder to do with storms growing more frequent and severe. But it's increasingly important to do as society depends more and more on electricity. Nationally, we expect to see 50% annual growth in electric cars and 12% annual growth in data centers. And ComEd particularly, is already seeing sizable opportunity in data centers. The data center growth will only strengthen as industries increasingly rely on cloud services and AI. As the nation's largest T&amp;D company, we must rise to the challenge of meeting these incremental demands on the grid. This operational performance was matched on the gas side, with all 3 utilities continuing to perform at top decile levels for gas odor response. Our customer satisfaction scores remain in line with those reported in our first quarter call. Our utilities are performing in the second quartile versus the 2021 benchmark when costs across the board were lower, pandemic relief had not yet rolled off and customers had not yet been impacted by the escalating interest rates and commodity prices. We are working every day to ensure customers are aware of the options they have to manage their costs, and we have seen increased engagement by our customers through these efforts. In fact, ComEd announced just 2 weeks ago that it won several recognitions in the 20th Annual Best Practices Awards by Chartwell. These annual Chartwell awards recognize excellence among electric and gas utilities with respect to customer-oriented projects, programs and service initiatives. One of these awards included recognition for ComEd's community energy assistance ambassador program. This program originally launched in 2020 in response to the economic impact of the pandemic. It was designed with a community-based organization to increase education and access to financial assistance options that can help income eligible customers pay their electric bills, while creating local employment opportunities for the same vulnerable population. But it is a constant reminder of the importance of focusing on value for our customers as well as affordability, and we are continuously seeking to reduce our own operating costs in addition to pursuing the customer-focused initiatives we have discussed. I will conclude by discussing our safety performance, where we lost ground at 3 of our 4 utilities. Ensuring our employees and contractors operate in a safe environment is of paramount importance. Lower performance this quarter largely resulted from low-impact OSHA recordables like slips and falls and minor vehicle-related incidents. As a result, each of our operating companies have action plans underway to address areas of needed improvement to ensuring that we are operating at our standards. This includes revisiting our safety plans for the year to ensure they are adequately addressing the issues we have observed year-to-date. Other examples include facility reviews to enhance safety and expanding our simulation-based training to offer more opportunities for employees. We are working hard to drive safety performance to the levels that we expect. I will now turn it over to Gene to discuss our financial performance and provide additional color on our regulatory activity in the second quarter. Jeanne?Jeanne M. JonesThank you, Calvin, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter financial update along with the outlook for the second half of 2023, our progress on the '23 rate case schedule, and I'll also highlight an ongoing project that exemplifies our commitment to delivering sustainable value as the premier T&amp;D energy company by modernizing critical infrastructure in the Philadelphia area. Starting on Slide 6, we show our quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating earnings. As Calvin mentioned, Exelon earned $0.41 per share in the second quarter of 2023 versus $0.44 in the second quarter of 2022, reflecting lower results of $0.03 per share over the same period. Results of $0.41 in the second quarter were right in line with the expectations provided in the prior earnings call. Earnings are lower in the second quarter relative to the same period last year, driven primarily by $0.04 of higher interest expense due to the rise in interest rates and higher levels of debt at the holding company and at some of our utilities as well as $0.03 of unfavorable weather at PECO. This was partially offset by $0.03 of higher distribution and transmission rates associated with incremental investments net of depreciation as well as a $0.01 of carrying costs related to the carbon mitigation credit balance at ComEd. Despite another quarter of mild weather impacting our nondecoupled jurisdictions, we delivered earnings results exactly where we said. Through the first half of 2023, operating earnings are $1.11 per share, reflecting 47% of the projected full year earnings. This is in line with how we performed through the first half of 2022. Looking ahead to next quarter, we expect a relative EPS contribution in the third quarter to be approximately 28% of the midpoint of our projected 2023 operating earnings guidance range. Recall that Q3 2022 saw strong growth from $0.04 of higher rates and effect with PECO's electric rate case in year 1 of its current rate cycle,as well as $0.03 of realized 30-year treasury rate uplift on ComEd's formula rate distribution ROE and another $0.03 of distribution formula rate timing at ComEd. While the fundamentals underpinning the earnings remaining this year, we expect third quarter '23 results to be lower. Net distribution and transmission growth will be offset by higher interest, and we also expect some timing of O&amp;M and taxes. For the fourth quarter of '23, we expect year-over-year earnings growth to benefit from the absence of proactive derisking that occurred in the fourth quarter of '22, the expected reversal of the O&amp;M and tax timing and the anticipated onetime impact of BGE's reconciliation for the '21 and '22 under recovery of its first multiyear plan. As we do not receive the final order on the reconciliation for BGE until December of '23, we cannot record BGE's earnings associated with the reconciliation until that time. In line with discussion on the first quarter earnings call, we expect the $0.07 of unfavorable weather experienced year-to-date to be offset with the combination of O&amp;M levers across the platform, favorable depreciation at PECO and the full year earnings impact of the carrying costs associated with the CMC regulatory asset balance. On a full year basis, we continue to reaffirm our 2023 EPS guidance range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share. Through a continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers and strong cost control across the platform, we remain on track to deliver earnings at the midpoint or better of our guidance range. The several months of weather and storm exposure remaining, you can expect we'll manage utility work plans to deliver earnings within expectations.Lastly, we are reaffirming the fully regulated operating EPS compounded annual growth target of 68% from 2021's and 2022 guidance midpoint through 2025 and 2026, respectively, with the expectation to be at the midpoint or better of that growth range. Turning to Slide 7. As Calvin mentioned, there have been some important developments on the regulatory front. Since the last earnings call, there was one new rate case filed, so I'll provide a status update on each of the 6 current open proceedings, starting with the most recent filing. On May 16, Pepco Maryland submitted its climate ready pathway, a 3-year multiyear plan application to the Maryland Public Service Commission. Pepco is requesting a $213.6 million revenue increase over the April 2024 and to December 2027 period, inclusive of a proposed 9-month extension reflecting an ROE of 10.5%. The filing outlines investments the company expects to make to support a climate-ready grid and enable cleaner energy programs and technologies that support Maryland's goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2045. As an example of the $150 million of climate solution programs that Calvin mentioned, are included in PepCo's proposed plan, more than half are dedicated to incentive for approximately 10,000 equipment electrification conversions for customers transitioning to cleaner technologies like heat pumps in the building sector. Another key category of spend is dedicated to enhancing reliability, resiliency and grid security through the installation of more modernized equipment that automatically detect system issues, reinforces the grid against more severe weather and protects the grid from potential physical or cyber threats. Overall, these investments are anticipated to inject more than $1.42 billion into the local economy and support more than 11,000 full-time jobs. For the last 3 years, spanning 2020 to 2022, Pepco has reported the best reliability performance of any electric distribution utility in the state of Maryland, a true testament to the company's commitment of powering a cleaner and brighter future for its customers and communities. Equally as important as reliability, Pepco is focused on keeping affordability front and center for our customers. The multiyear plan includes the acceleration of tax benefits to serve as a bill offset as well as efforts to increase participation in energy assistance and energy efficiency programs, which in 2022 alone provided approximately $23 million to Pepco Maryland customers. An order is expected by June of 2024. Let me also remind you of the other electric distribution rate cases in progress. First, Delmarva Power Delaware has revised a revenue request for a $41.8 million increase based on an updated test period in the electric rate case and as permitted by Delaware law, implemented full proposed rates on July 15 subject to refund. A decision is expected in the second quarter of 2024. Similarly, ACE revised their revenue request for a $93.6 million increase based on an updated test period, with the final order expected in the first quarter of '24. Additionally, after an 8-month receiving, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved a 4-year capital tracker at ACE called Powering the Future, which accelerates the portfolio of projects totaling $93 million, designed to enhance reliability and resiliency for customers, advance New Jersey's energy master plan goals and sustained economic growth in the region. Next, ComEd and BGE surpassed 2 key milestones in their multiyear plan rate cases, having received intervener testimony and filed their rebuttals to support the key elements of the company's initial proposals earlier this year. As discussed on prior earnings calls, both plans outline the investments needed to provide essential service to customers while meeting the clean energy and equity goals of their respective states. In both the ComEd and BGE multiyear plan rate cases, evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin in late August with briefs to follow before final orders are expected in December. Lastly, Pepco received a procedural schedule from the Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia in its second multiyear rate plan filing. Upcoming milestones include intervenor testimony expected to be filed by the DC Public Service Commission staff on October 16 and evidentiary hearing set to begin in January of 2024 with final briefs in March of 24. Relationships across our jurisdictions remain constructive, and we are working together with our regulators, states and communities through every step of the process to reach our shared goals. As Calvin mentioned, by next year, we expect our resolution on all 4 of the ongoing multiyear rate plans in Illinois, Maryland and D.C. and a clear path forward to supporting clean energy and climate goals in an affordable and equitable manner. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 20 through 26 of the appendix. Moving to Slide 8. During the second quarter, we continued to invest capital for the benefit of our customers and are on track to meet our $7.2 billion guidance for 2023. These investments in energy infrastructure are vital to maintaining the high standard of service that we have in serving our customers while preparing the grid for the clean energy transformation and increasing levels of electrification. Today, I'll talk about how PECO is partnering with the community to build a new 69-13 kV substation in Philadelphia at the Civic Terminal Yard and neighboring property. PECO's commitment to building the new Civic substation began in 2019. This $130 million project includes installation of insulated switchgear and modifications to 4 69-kV transmission lines into civic substations that will allow for the retirement of 2 69-kV transmission lines currently running under the Schuylkill River. The new substation is expected to increase distribution and transmission reliability through the reconfiguration of the lines and increased flood resiliency in the low-lying areas surrounding the substations, where access has been restricted in the past following heavy thunderstorms. It will also enable PECO to relieve low constraints, supply additional capacity to the University City area and better serve critical customers on the west side of the river. Once fully energized, which is expected by the second quarter of '24, the Civic substation will be PECO's newest and most modern insulated substation. While traditional open-air substation construction would have required 5 to 7 acres of land, the upgraded electrical equipment associated with the insulated substation allows PECO to build on less than a 2-acre plot of land. That represents a 60% to 70% reduction in required land use. Since project inception, PECO has partnered with its customers, government agencies and other local utilities to ensure construction of the civic substation has a minimal impact to the city of Philadelphia, the surrounding customers and on the environment, protecting the nearby waterway and riverbank. With vital customers in the area, such as the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the University of Pennsylvania Hospital and the Philadelphia Veteran Affairs Medical Center, operational excellence is imperative. As an Exelon utility, PECO is ready to deliver it. Turning to Slide 9. I will conclude with a review of our balance sheet activity. As a reminder, we continue to project 100 to 200 basis points of cushion on average over our guidance period for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above S&amp;P and Moody's downgrade thresholds of 12%, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. If the corporate alternative minimum tax is not mitigated through an inclusion of repairs in its calculation, we anticipate being at 100 basis points or the lower end of that range. We continue to await specific guidance on the corporate alternative minimum tax implementation and are hopeful to have resolution by year-end. In the meantime, the Department of Treasury issued a notice granting deferral of estimated tax payments associated with the corporate alternative minimum tax until 2024, which points to the appreciation that more guidance is required for implementation. From a financing perspective, we successfully raised nearly $1.3 billion for BGE and PECO in the second quarter, which completes all of our planned debt financing needs for 2023. The strong investor demand we continue to see for our debt offerings is supported by the strength of our balance sheet and by the low-risk attributes of our platform. In line with the last earnings call, there has been no change in our guidance to issue $425 million of equity at the holding company by '25. We'll continue to update you as we make progress on the plan. Thank you. And I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks.Calvin G. ButlerThank you, Jeanne. I will once again remind the investment community of what we're working to accomplish in 2023. We take great pride in our operational excellence, which our employees dedicate themselves to daily. Summer is when we see some of the most severe weather activity, and our teams embrace the challenge to get customers back online quickly and safely. As we proceed with our work of supporting the energy transformation in our ongoing rate cases, we are very focused on listening to our stakeholders. We want to ensure that we are delivering the right investment plans and the right services to support meeting their energy transformation and climate goals in an affordable and equitable manner. After this year, much of our path forward for the next several years will be established and clear. The team also understands it must deliver on our financial priorities and guidance. Efficiently investing $7.2 billion of capital and earning ROEs in the 9% to 10% range will support meeting our 2023 earnings guidance range of $2.30 to $2.42 per share and keeping our balance sheet strong. And finally, we're continuing to look for innovative ways to support our customers and communities end-to-end throughout our business. In partnership with the Exelon Foundation, we are looking to place our next round of investments in the $20 million climate change investment initiative fund or 2c2i, an innovative way to advance solutions to the challenges brought by climate change, while improving the quality of life for residents of our cities. For this year, 5 companies were selected to receive investments, spanning areas like software analytics to track air quality, nonrecyclable plastic reuse and novel EV charging solutions. Every day, we're reminded that the energy transformation is happening, and we have to be a vital role in it. And we have a talented team that's incredibly excited to play that role. We recently announced that Colette Honorable will be joining us as our Executive Vice President of Public Policy and Chief External Affairs Officer. As a renowned energy policy leader who brings expertise in areas like clean energy transformation and equable ratemaking, she will be an invaluable addition to our team. And she'll help us build on the strong foundation we already have in place, built by the team that got us here. In particular, I want to recognize Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of our business services company, Bridget Reidy, who is retiring in September and played an integral role in shaping our organizational commitment to excellence. She also made incredible strides in diversity, equity and inclusion across the wide variety of corporate support groups that she led like IT and supply. Thank you, Bridget, for your leadership. Our team's commitment to leading the energy transformation is what makes us the premier transmission and distribution utility, one that lives by its values, supports its communities and offers a uniquely strong expected total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. Thank you, as always, for your interest. I'll now turn it to Gigi for your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.David Keith ArcaroLet's see, wondering if you could speak to the comment and BGE rate cases and how these have progressed so far relative to your expectations? Just when you look at the key intervener testimony that we've gotten so far, like staff in both cases, how have these shaped up overall in terms of the focus areas versus what you had expected?Calvin G. ButlerYes, David, thank you. This is Calvin. I would tell you that they're proceeding as planned. And the teams have provided their responses, and as Jeanne mentioned, we're going through the [shareholder] process. But we have with us both Gil Quiniones, President and CEO of ComEd; and Carim Khouzami, President and CEO of BGE, who can -- I'll ask them to just kind of take your time and walk you through some of the highlights of each and what you can expect moving forward. I'll start with Gil of ComEd.Gil C. QuinionesYes. This is Gil from ComEd. The ICC staff and interveners in the aggregate did not waver from their initial positions filed in their direct testimony in May. They maintained their position in ROE and the pension asset. Their challenges on capital center on certain IT projects, our fiber and proposed private LTE communications network upgrades and systematic and programmatic spending. The rate case process still playing out, as Calvin mentioned, and we will continue to make our case for those capital investments. We continue to have regular meetings with staff and interveners to provide additional information, answer any of their questions and provide clarification.Calvin G. ButlerCarim?Carim V. KhouzamiThis is Carim Khouzami from BGE. As Calvin mentioned, the case is proceeding as expected. The staff has come in with a proposal of about 70% of our ask. As expected, some of the areas of debate surround ROE investments in our gas system and some building electrification programs that BGE proposed for the first time to help the state meet its climate change goals. One of the things to point out, as you know, reconciliations of the first time it is being done in Maryland in a multiyear plan. Both staff and OPC and other intervening parties suggested about 90% of our requests. So again, that is proceeding well. So all in all, going well. As Calvin and Jeanne mentioned, we have more hearings at the end of August, early September with the final order expected in mid-December.Calvin G. ButlerAnd David, I would just add to that, both plans were built on helping the states meet their environmental and climate goals as well as economic development and job creation opportunities. So the stakeholder process, I don't want to underrepresent because both companies have been very engaged in that process and meeting with all stakeholders. So again, proceeding, it's a process that will play itself out. But we expect orders for both companies by the end of the year.David Keith ArcaroThat's really helpful color. And appreciating that there are new commissioners in both states, do you see an opportunity for settling on any issues, partial settlement, full settlement? Or is the expectation and strategy just kind of see this through kind of a fully litigated case more likely?Calvin G. ButlerNo, great question, David. We expect to see them both fully through and recognizing that, as Carim mentioned, first time for the reconciliation process in Maryland. And it's the next 3 years, we'll see it through and let it play out. And for Gil, moving from the formula rate to a 4-year multiyear plan, it's important that everyone feels that they've had a chance to voice their opinions and that stakeholder process is critical to that. So we do see it playing out all the way to the end of the year.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of James Kennedy from Guggenheim Partners.James KennedySo I guess I'll start with the transmission announcement this morning, the $870 million for brand insurers. Is the portion that falls in the current plan, purely incremental? And secondly, any color on the potential quantum of other opportunities like these as we start to see other retirements in EMAC and BGE?Calvin G. ButlerThank you, James. First off, it is all additive to the current plan. We do not have any of that, as we've conveyed to you previously, we were never going to put anything that we were striving to get until we want it. So that's important. I have with us today David Velazquez, our EVP of Operations, to provide additional oversight or insight into this because David oversees our transmission strategy across Exelon. So David?David M. VelazquezYes. Thank you, Calvin. And James, thanks for the question. Besides the brands insurers transmission reinforcements that are needed, you may be aware that PJM also has an open -- what they call an open window to help transmission reinforcements needed for additional load growth in the dominion territory. That is currently open. We have submitted 4 different proposals in that open window range from, I'll say, smaller enhancements in the $300 million range to large projects that help meet both short- and longer-term needs that are well over $1 billion. And PJM will provide an initial readout of their recommendations committee meetings in September, October time frame with an expected decision from the PJM Board in December of this year. In addition to that, there are offshore -- their transmission reinforcement needed for offshore wind, both in New Jersey and also in Maryland. And there's legislation in Maryland that requires the PSC by July 1 of next year to make a report back to the legislature and then to issue a solicitation for transmission reinforcements for offshore wind by July of '25. So not just with the brand insurers retirement, but offshore wind, load growth. And again, cannot predict generation retirements, but if they occur, we are ready to do what we need to do to ensure the reliability of the grid.James KennedyExcellent. And then just second question real quick. Can we get an update on the ComEd franchise agreement process?Calvin G. ButlerYes. Right now, it's status quo. You can appreciate the team has been very involved in the franchise. And with the new Mayor coming in line, he is assembling his team. Gil and the ComEd team have been working very closely with him on several issues. And really, what we're talking about is that we had come to an agreement with the [Lifewood] administration earlier this year, as you know, on that franchise and the parameters of that proposal, we have discussed with you on previous calls. But at this time, the Mayor and I think the team is looking at those provisions and trying to make it his own, this administration's own. Gil, would you have anything else you'd like to add there?Gil C. QuinionesThe only thing I want to add, Calvin, is that we have had initial conversations with them, and they had informed us when they are ready, we will engage and restart our negotiations for a new franchise in Chicago. But in the meantime, our existing franchise agreement continues.Calvin G. ButlerAnd that's very important for us. And in addition, I just want to recognize that Gil has been partnering with them. He was just recently named to the Environmental Justice transition subcommittee for this Mayor. So the team has plugged in with the administration, and more of why that's important is they're understanding what their priorities are as a new administration. And I think that will play directly into the new franchise agreement.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo from Bank of America.Paul Andrew ZimbardoFirst, I just wanted to get a little bit more clarity. If you could briefly comment on that SEC matter that you disclosed in the earnings results that you just out. Does this fully resolve that legacy SEC investigation?Jeanne M. JonesPaul, it's Jeanne. So the SEC investigation is still ongoing, but we did reach a point where a loss contingency was probable. So we did book that. You can see it's treated similarly to how we had treated the initial DPA amount. It's a nonoperating onetime nonrecurring item that is in nonoperating earnings. So it's continuing, but it is related to the investigation that began in 2019. So the same original investigation.Paul Andrew ZimbardoOkay. Great. Yes. I just wanted to clarify if that's original stream.Jeanne M. JonesYes.Paul Andrew ZimbardoOkay. Great. And then second, just as we think about the long term, I know you reaffirmed that expectation midpoint or better 2023 plus, just interest rates keep ticking up stubbornly like 50 basis points even since the last update. Could you discuss some of the areas of offsets, whether cost or otherwise, to kind of combat those higher parent costs?Calvin G. ButlerYes. Well, I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Jeanne. As you alluded to is that we are seeing -- our customers aren't immune to the higher-cost commodity prices that are going on across the country. But we have always, as a company, been very aggressive in managing our costs, and that didn't change upon the separation. Our first and foremost priority was ensuring that our costs didn't go up as a result of that separation. But let me tell you some of the things that we've done. We've realigned our real estate portfolio, creating flexible work arrangements to rationalize our office footprint. We've automated -- we continue to look for ways to automate our work processes and really becoming more efficient and nimble in response to our customers' needs. And we've centralized our transmission operations to harness best practices on organizational efficiencies. And it's important to note that over the course of our -- since 2016 with the course of our plan, our O&amp;M CAGR has only gone up 1.7%. And the year-over growth is just over 1% in 2023. I say that to you to say that costs continue to be a primary focus of the organization and affordability for our customers. Having said that, we're not done. We're just scratching the surface as a leadership team to really look at how we're going to operate as one Exelon, as a pure transmission and distribution utility company. And we continue to focus on that. So that is what our focus is on day in and day out. Jeanne?Jeanne M. JonesYes, I think that's well said and all of that reduce the O&amp;M and preserve the cash, which minimizes the amount also that we need to finance in terms of our investments, so getting that cash and redeploying it back into the business. The only other thing I will add is on the interest rates, how we do as a whole -- at the operating companies, we're stepping into new sort of new rate cases, so the ability to recover the incremental interest there is important. But at the parent company, we do engage in reinsurance hedging and so being able to lock in with certainty ahead of time heading into a year what that interest expense is, is important. So we'll continue those practices that helped us heading into '23, and you can expect us to do that for future issuances as well.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Securities, LLC.Aidan Charles KellyThis is actually Aidan Kelly on for Jeremy. Just wondering, would you be able to outline your current credit metrics relative to thresholds and plan targets? And how could this ultimately contribute to your $425 million remaining equity?Jeanne M. JonesSure. It's Jeanne. So on the current credit metrics, I think S&amp;P and Moody's just recently published kind of the prior 12 months, those were at 13%. And as we show in our slides and as I talked about in the script, as we look at our '23 through '26 time period, we expect to be at that average of 13%. And as a reminder, our downgrade threshold is 12%. And that 12% is afforded to us and we don't take it lightly, that's why we have that cushion. But it's a reflection of our low-risk platform, right, diversity, scale, forward-looking rate mechanisms, 75% decoupled revenues. So all of that put together -- no generation, all of that results in a very low risk profile. But we like to manage at that 100 or 200 basis points above that. So we're at the 13, as the rate agencies just published. We expect to be at that 13%. If we get the corporate alternative minimum tax mitigated, we'd be closer to the mid-higher, like that 13.5%, 14%. And we're hopeful to know that final regulations or at least preliminary regulations by the end of the year. You asked how that relates to our equity. We have no change in plans related to the $425 million. So said another way, if we got the corporate alternative minimum tax alleviated, we'd still do that $425 million. And so you can expect us to do that sometime between now and 2025. The last thing I'll say is just as it relates to Moody's and S&amp;P, there is a little bit of difference in the calculation. S&amp;P will sort of trend at that 13% over the time horizon. Moody's, however, because of the calculation, there is some cash timing differences. So we expect to be sort of on the low end in '23, '24 and then on the higher end in the back end, such that you average 13%. And that's really driven by some of the formula rate timing at ComEd with the true-up coming for '22 and '23 coming in, in '24 and '25. But that's sort of -- that's why we give you the average, because we want to sort of neutralize some of that cash flow timing as well.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs.Carly S. DavenportYou had mentioned kind of O&amp;M levers to offset mild weather this year. So could you just talk a little bit about how O&amp;M costs have been tracking relative to your expectations? And then what you expect to see for the balance of the year from a rate of change perspective on O&amp;M?Calvin G. ButlerSo initially, we've always maintained a philosophy that we will drive O&amp;M costs below the rate of inflation. Now that was over the traditional rate of inflation that we've been experiencing over the last several years, keeping that around 2% to 2.5%. And as I mentioned, we're trending strong and keeping -- or meeting our objectives of doing so. And that has always been our benchmark. The CEOs, who are sitting around the table, we talk about keeping our O&amp;M flat and seeing what levers are driving it to possibly go up, which allows us that flexibility when you have unseasonally warm winters or anything else in PECO or the like. Because 75% of our rate base, our 73% is decoupled. So a lot of the weather impacts that you're talking about really focus on PECO primarily as the largest utility that's done. Having said that, we will continue to manage those costs. We never take our foot off the gas in doing so. Jeanne?Jeanne M. JonesYes. And as it relates to the weather for '23, we had a combination of offsets across the platform, mostly at PECO, BGE and PHI given ComEd has the formula rate true-up on O&amp;M. But across those 3 operating companies, we saw O&amp;M levers, whether it was taking advantage of labor vacancies, lower T&amp;E and contracting spend. And then in addition to that, PECO had some favorable depreciation. So the combination of all that was probably around $0.04 of the $0.07 of weather, and then we had the ComEd carrying costs, which were a benefit this year. And it's a benefit this year relative to last year, because we did not have this large reg asset really sort of was built up at the back end of last year and the interest deposit rate on that was 0 for the commission. So we weren't getting an interest offset, even though we were incurring interest on that last year. However, now in this year is a benefit both to last year and to guidance because we have the larger reg asset this year. And while we're still incurring the carrying cost on that, the ICC reset the deposit rate at 5% this year. And so relative to guidance, we are now having an offset to that, that wasn't baked into our plan. So that's probably about $0.03 of the $0.07. So you put all that together, that's how we're offsetting the $0.07 of weather. And to Calvin's point, we just continue to focus on what else we can do to drive down those costs. And we're just starting to scratch the surface there.Carly S. DavenportGot it. That's helpful. And then just on the corporate minimum tax. I know you mentioned expecting to at least get kind of preliminary clarity there by the end of this year. But is there any color that you can share maybe from your discussions around the temperature on the tax repairs deduction and getting the gating factors to that being included?Jeanne M. JonesI would just say it's probably -- there's not much else to share. There are ongoing discussions. Their stakeholders remain receptive to the discussion and to the technical differences that the utility industry faces in being a very capital-intensive utility and some of the regulatory accounting that will release that capital-intensive nature of our industry. So receptive discussions ongoing. And I did mention earlier in the script, we did see some guidance come out in June that basically said, ""Hey, if you think you're subject to this tax, you won't be penalized if you don't pay it this year. We understand there's more sort of guidance and interpretation needed."" And so that was just one other data point. But just ongoing discussions and we remain hopeful that we'll have more clarity by the end of the year.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI.Durgesh ChopraSo I just want to go back to the ComEd rate case real quick. And some of us were expecting an update from staff on the ROE calculation and the output itself. It seems like they're kind of using the same methodology and using rates as of last year. Just how do you see that progressing? Any thoughts there would be appreciated.Jeanne M. JonesYes. I think as Gil mentioned, still more to come. We're still putting forth a strong argument around our proposed ROE. As you mentioned, they did not change their position. It appears to be sort of this continuation of the formula, which (inaudible) was clear that the sunset of the formula rate was required. So our filing offers an ROE that we feel appropriately reflects the actual cost of equity, taking into account the current market conditions. So we'll continue to work through that process. I think there's that data point and then there's the electric proxy group, which is also another data point and the staff testimony. So we'll continue to work through that with them. But no changes as of this point.Durgesh ChopraGot it. Okay. It sounds like we'll get an update here before the end of the year. Just switching gears. I have a question on supply chain, and Calvin or anybody else in the room, would love your views there. Just we've seen several media reports on transformer shortages. So maybe broadly, can you comment -- you have a sizable CapEx plan, obviously. But just broadly, can you comment on equipment shortages, labor shortages? And how is that tracking this year versus, let's say, 12 months ago?Calvin G. ButlerYes. I would tell you that one of the, I would say, advantage is of being of our scale and our platform is that we're able to leverage the size to not only access our current suppliers, but identify new ones. So directly to your question, we have not seen a shortage in our transformers. We have not seen a shortage in workforce or any other things that are impacting us executing on this capital plan. Now what we do pay attention to, as new businesses coming online, our ability to give that online in the time frame that some of our customers are looking for because that wasn't part of that initial planned work. So we stay on top of that and working with our supply organization. But to date, we are not experiencing those same issues that others made.Jeanne M. JonesI think one of the benefits of our profile rate of the $31 billion, as we've talked about before, not one project is greater than 1% of that spend. So the ability to kind of manage that portfolio in bite sizes to the extent we do experience any issues allows us to be able to stay on track and deliver.OperatorThank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO, for closing remarks.Calvin G. ButlerGigi, thank you very much. And I just want to always thank you all for joining us today. From the comments made today by Jeanne and I and the leadership team around the table, you see that we're focused and delivering on plan. So as always, appreciate your interest, and this concludes our call.OperatorThanks to all our participants for joining us today. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.]"

This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.24 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Exelon shares have lost about 4.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.2%.What's Next for Exelon?While Exelon has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in M&amp;T Bank (NYSE:MTB). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for M&amp;T Bank How Quickly Is M&amp;T Bank Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Impressively, M&amp;T Bank has grown EPS by 17% per year, compound, in the last three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Our analysis has highlighted that M&amp;T Bank's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. M&amp;T Bank maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 50% to US$9.3b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for M&amp;T Bank?Are M&amp;T Bank Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since M&amp;T Bank has a market capitalisation of US$23b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$122m. This comes in at 0.5% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like M&amp;T Bank, the median CEO pay is around US$12m.M&amp;T Bank's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$8.8m in the year leading up to December 2022. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Should You Add M&amp;T Bank To Your Watchlist?For growth investors, M&amp;T Bank's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. If you need more convincing beyond that EPS growth rate, don't forget about the reasonable remuneration and the high insider ownership. Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to investing but it definitely makes M&amp;T Bank look rather interesting indeed. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted   1 warning sign for M&amp;T Bank  you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

The leading wireless solutions provider reported lower revenues year over year due to a slowdown in revenues of Enterprise products.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, quarterly net loss was $2.6 million or a loss of 10 cents per share against a net income of $2.3 million or 8 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. Net sales contraction and higher operating expenses dented the bottom line during the quarter.Non-GAAP net income came in at $0.9 million or 3 cents per share compared with $5 million or 18 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents by a considerable margin.Cambium Networks Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseCambium Networks Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Cambium Networks Corporation QuoteRevenuesDuring the quarter, Cambium generated revenues of $59.5 million, down from $69.3 million in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year decline was attributable to significantly lower sales of Enterprise products owing to aggressive pricing by competitors and soft global economic conditions leading to order cancellations and delays in end-customer projects. Lower net sales in Point-to-Multi-Point (PMP) revenues added to the woes, while higher Point-To-Point (PTP) product sales partially reversed this positive trend. The top line missed the consensus estimate of $76 million.By product category, quarterly revenues at PMP came in at $26.7 million compared with $28.3 million a year ago. The declining demand trends from service providers owing to the transition from PMP 450 products to Cambium’s new gigabit technologies hurt net sales from this segment. Revenues from the PTP business rose to $25.1 million from $15.7 million in the prior-year quarter, driven by robust growth in the defense business. Revenues at the Enterprises business declined to $6.4 million from $24 million in the year-ago quarter.  Region-wise, revenues from North America rose to $39.5 million from $31.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) declined to $6.8 million from $21.3 million in the prior-year quarter. The company witnessed a top-line decline from the CALA (Caribbean and Latin America) region, as revenues fell from $8 million in the year-ago quarter to $6 million. Revenues from Asia-Pacific declined to $7.2 million from $8.9 million in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesOther DetailsNon-GAAP gross profit decreased to $29.9 million from $33.9 million for respective margins of 50.3% and 48.9%. The decline was largely due to lower Enterprise revenues. Non-GAAP operating income was down to $1.6 million from $6.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.8 million compared with $7.8 million a year ago, for respective margins of 4.7% and 11.3%.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityDuring the quarter, Cambium utilized $4.5 million against an operating cash flow of $10 million in the prior-year quarter. As of Jun 30, 2023, the company had a $32 million cash balance with $23.2 million long-term debt.OutlookFor the third quarter of 2023, revenues are expected in the range of $62-$70 million, while non-GAAP earnings are anticipated in the band of $3.7-$6.9 million or 13-25 cents per share. Non-GAAP operating income is projected between $5.2 million and $9.2 million, while adjusted EBITDA is likely to be in the range of $6.3-$10.3 million, with a corresponding margin between 10.2% and 14.8%.For 2023, management has lowered its revenue estimates to the range of $265-$275 million from $327-$337 million. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 50.2% and 51.6%. Non-GAAP net income is expected in the band of $16.7-$21.9 million or 59-78 cents per share, down from $33.7-$36 million or $1.18-$1.26 per share expected earlier. The company plans to maintain its cost-control initiatives, and management is conservative about revenue growth rate owing to the persistence of uncertainty in the global economy.Zacks Rank &amp; Stock to ConsiderArista currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.InterDigital, Inc.

398,63e34397-0b36-3478-987b-d3c79fd1b8a4,CL,2023-08-03,Oil tumbles after 5-week rally; Saudi deception suggested amid U.S. stockpile drop,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-tumbles-5-week-rally-144322923.html,1690987402,STORY,"['NYF', 'SCO', 'UCO', 'CL', 'HO=F', 'CL=F']","[Investing.com -- Crude prices fell more than 2% Wednesday as those long the market took meaningful profit the first time since a five-week rally in oil began.The slump, interestingly, came on a day when the Energy Information Administration reported an epic drop in weekly U.S. crude stockpiles, after weeks of citing paltry inventories despite OPEC leader Saudi Arabia claiming to be cutting an additional million barrels per day from its production since the start of July that would take 2.5 million daily off its output.More interesting than the EIA report was a story suggesting the Saudis might be playing a deception game with their production cuts by “quietly selling” additional oil to the so-called PNZ, or Partitioned Neutral Zone, region it shared with Kuwait that escapes the radar of the broader market.“Saudi Arabia has a long history of doing this, so it’s no surprise that it’s looking to increase its oil sales through extra production from the PNZ [Partitioned Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait], particularly as the area’s so off the radar, and Russia has been doing the same with its oil for months,” OilPrice.com quoted a senior source in the European Union energy security complex as telling it in a story it carried late Tuesday.According to the source, although the joint statement by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on 9 July said that accelerated efforts to complete joint oil projects in the PNZ are to meet local energy demands, in reality they are to provide Saudi Arabia with off-the-radar – ‘dark inventory’ – oil that it can sell through various backdoor methods at currently inflated prices, without being seen to break its official OPEC+ quota.“To me, the PNZ story is also not surprising as deceiving the market on production cuts is OPEC’s number one game, since the days of yore,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital. “There’s no doubt that this story has contributed somewhat to the downside in oil today, aside from real profit-taking that’s going on.”Story continuesU.S. West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude settled Wednesday’s trade down $1.88, or 2.3%, at $79.49 per barrel. It was the largest one-day drop in crude prices since a 4.4% tumble on June 12 that drove WTI to $66.80 per barrel — before the five-week rally that gave the U.S. crude benchmark a near 16% return for July.London-based Brent crude settled down $1.71, or 2%, at $83.20. The global oil benchmark gained nearly 14% for July.Earlier on Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA, reported that domestic crude inventories dropped by 17.049M barrels during the week ended July 28, versus forecasts for a decline of just 1.367M and the drop of 0.6M for the week to July 21.Over three previous weeks, the EIA had been reporting lackluster draws on the U.S. petroleum complex despite Saudi Arabia claiming to have taken an additional million barrels per day off its daily production.Analysts have said that while it wasn’t logical to expect a barrel-for-barrel correlation between changes in Saudi crude exports and U.S. inventories, the EIA as the world’s premier provider of transparent and comprehensive data on energy, had to be capturing the shifts in the global supply situation at least in its weekly data — notwithstanding the apparent Saudi “game” on the PNZ front.“What this also means is that the EIA came through and the Saudis probably did not,” said Kilduff, the hedge fund partner.In its latest Weekly Petroleum Status Report, the EIA also said U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged 16.5M barrels per day during the week ending July 28 — up 0.04M more than the previous week’s average.Refineries operated at 92.7% of their operable capacity last week, the EIA said, adding that gasoline production increased as well last week to an average of 9.8M per day along with distillate fuel production, which averaged 4.9M daily.On the gasoline inventory front, there was a build of 1.481M barrels over the 0.786M-barrel decline in the previous week. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.With distillate stockpiles, there was a drop of 0.796M barrels versus the prior week’s deficit of 0.245M. Distillates are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains and ships and fuel for jets.Related ArticlesOil tumbles after 5-week rally; Saudi deception suggested amid U.S. stockpile dropOil settle lower despite record US crude stock drawdownBiden admin split over ethanol's role in aviation fuel subsidy program]"

To skip the detailed analysis of the technology services industry, go directly to the 5 Oversold Tech Stocks To Buy.The technology sector has been booming so far in 2023, mostly due to the generative artificial intelligence segment. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been on the rise for the past few years, but companies are leaning towards investing in the sector more than ever in the current year. According to a survey by CNBC, when companies were asked which technologies they expected to allocate the most capital to over the next 12 months, 47.37% chose AI as their top choice. Other options included, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Nayur Khan, Partner at McKinsey says:“We are at an inflection point with artificial intelligence. Generative AI has captured both mainstream and business imaginations. Organizations that are willing to continuously learn and adapt their processes, ways of working, and technology to industrialize ML will succeed in building the muscle needed to leverage AI at scale and unlock its value.”While another Senior Partner, Delphine Nain Zurkiya adds:“We often get asked by executives if generative AI is hype or a fundamental shift—the answer is both. From a scientific point of view, foundational models are not hype—they comprise a new class of AI that is elegant in its simplicity yet incredibly powerful in its ability to be tuned to perform many tasks in a human-like manner. From a business point of view, these technologies have the potential to fundamentally disrupt entire categories.”The technology sector has been performing well for the past decade but it seems like 2022 just wasn’t its year. Between January to June 2022, the tech-heavy NASDAQ composite was down 29.5% and finished the year with a decline of 32.5%. It was the second-worst year for the NASDAQ composite since 2002. The first one was during the Great Recession of 2008 when it went down 40.5% for the full year. Nevertheless, we cannot single out the sector in 2022 because it was one of the worst years for the global economy and US equities. The only sectors that ended with positive returns in the year were energy and utilities. On top of that, the investments in the tech sector still managed to reach over $1 trillion in 2022, despite the tough economic conditions.Story continuesThe biggest names in the tech industry have been enjoying the year so far even though the macroeconomic headwinds from the previous year still haven’t phased out. On May 30, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) became the first chip company to touch the $1 trillion market cap milestone and is almost up 210% YTD at the time of writing on August 2. Other elites such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have also experienced significant gains this year and are up nearly 153%, 50%, and 37% YTD, respectively. A lot of the growth of these companies can be attributed to investments during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to research, the companies that doubled down on their tech investment during the pandemic are now growing five times faster than the ones that didn’t.Even though the NASDAQ Composite and NASDAQ-100 are up around 35% and 42% year-to-date at the time of writing on August 2, there are still some stocks that haven’t been doing well and you can check them out on our 15 Worst Performing NASDAQ Stocks In 2023 article.

Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX)14-day RSI as of August 2: 34.10Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) is an American industrial automation company focusing on machine vision technology that is used for the automation of manufacturing and distribution functions. The company is headquartered in Massachusetts and operates worldwide. Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) had a 14-day relative strength index of 34.10 before the market opening on August 2, making it our 10th most oversold tech stock.In the first quarter of 2023, Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) was held by 23 hedge fund holders with a combined stake value of $313.511 million. Fundsmith LLP was the company's most prominent hedge fund holder, owning over 2 million shares worth $102.062 million.Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX)’s first quarter 2023 revenue declined by 28.8% year-over-year due to lower consumer spending and weak demand. However, AI is a major tailwind for the company which can benefit Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) in the long term. The company plans to announce its second quarter 2023 result before the market opens on August 3 and expects revenue between the range of $225 million and $245 million.Euronet Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:EEFT), TELUS International (Cda) Inc. (NYSE:TIXT), and Perficient, Inc. (NASDAQ:PRFT) are some of the most oversold tech stocks to buy along with Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX).RGA Investment Advisors made the following comment about Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“This question as to whether anything has structurally changed is as applicable to e-commerce as it is to 2022’s most talked about economic datapoint: the CPI. Before the pandemic, people would speak about “secular stagnation” and the strong disinflationary forces that kept the economy from experiencing a robust post-Great Financial Crisis recovery. Today, we are far more likely to hear about stagflation than “secular stagnation”, yet the economy is growing faster today than it was in the past. We must therefore ask ourselves, what are the biggest changes from before the pandemic to now that would change our economic outlook from disinflation to inflation. The largest change is what people now call “The Great Resignation” whereby Boomers who entered the workforce in the 1970s finally retiring en masse.[3] This can have consequences for wages, though we would caution against fearing a wage price spiral as underinvestment in efficiency due to an overabundance of labor during the past decade can finally commence with lower levels of fear for labor unions and politicians alike. In fact, investments in productivity might even be encouraged now with fears of inflation front-and-center. As we have pointed out several times in the past, Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) stands to benefit considerably from this change.”9. Juniper Networks, Inc.

(GNRC) and bar-code manufacturer Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA).Meanwhile, ZBRA’s brand strength, distribution network and commitment to innovation enable it to take share, earn industry-leading profitability and penetrate new markets. A recent pullback in stock price provided an attractive entry point. Shares have come under pressure due to investor concerns around inflation and supply chain disruptions. At current valuation levels, we think investors are underappreciating ZBRA’s alignment with the global effort to improve supply chain efficiency. At the same time, the company is leveraging the wide moat in its core business to expand into faster growing markets including warehouse robotics and machine vision. Meanwhile ZBRA continues to deliver prodigious free cash flow which we believe will continue to be deployed towards both growth and share repurchases.”Click to continue reading and see the 5 Oversold Tech Stocks To Buy.Suggested articles:10 Best Small Cap Automotive Stocks To Buy11 Most Advanced AI Companies20 Worst Performing Economies in 2023Disclosure.

To skip our detailed analysis of current market dynamics, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Bargain Stocks To Buy in August.Fitch Downgrades US Debt - AAA to AA+On August 2, Fitch Ratings downgraded the US credit rating from a long-held AAA to AA+ while holding a Stable Outlook. The downgrade came in light of the country's ""expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years, a high and growing general government debt burden, and the erosion of governance relative to 'AA' and 'AAA' rated peers over the last to decades,"" according to Fitch. In light of this downgrade, US markets have been down for the day. The S&amp;P 500 fell by 65.64 basis points, or 1.44%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 355.50 basis points, or 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite index fell by 316.56 basis points, or 2.22%, on August 2. While some are worried that this is signaling the end to the extended stock rally seen in the markets so far this year, others don't seem to be all too worried about the downgrade.On August 2, CNBC's Closing Bell showed a snippet from an earlier conversation with Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. According to Dimon, the Fitch downgrade ""doesn't really matter that much."" He also noted that while there are several countries now that are higher-rated than the US, these countries continue to live under the ""American military enterprise,"" highlighting that the US still retains its international dominance. Additionally, Liz Young, the head of investment at SoFi, also noted at CNBC's Closing Bell that this downgrade isn't a surprise, but it's also not a big deal for the US at present. The country very narrowly avoided a default two months ago, and the state of the markets and the economy continues to be volatile.Is A Pause In The Rally A Good Thing?However, this should not worry investors too much. According to Young, the pause in the stock market rally after the downgrade and the ensuing market pullback may even be healthy for the market in the long run. Finally, Josh Brown, the CEO, and co-founder of Ritholtz Wealth Management, also noted during the closing bell that before the downgrade, the average gains for the top 20 S&amp;P 500 stocks stood at around 83%, and these same stocks have fallen by about 3% on average after the Fitch downgrade. Brown believes that investors should consider this an opportunity to find stocks to go long on rather than pulling out of these companies entirely.Story continuesMost of the stocks that have been on the rise in the S&amp;P 500 so far this year include tech stocks, primarily, followed by other sectors such as consumer staples and healthcare, among more. Sectors like these that have largely been performing well in 2023 can serve as excellent investment opportunities at present since top-tier stocks in these areas are currently down. Investors can thus add these names to their portfolios at a bargain if they act fast and act smart. Companies like Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), and AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO), among several others, are considered to be some of the best bargain stocks in the market today, according to analysts. However, other stocks that have particularly begun falling in light of the Fitch downgrade may also be worth taking a look at right now. They may well be considered to be some of the best cheap stock options to buy today. Since the S&amp;P 500's top performers were the ones that took the biggest hits after the downgrade, picking them up now may also ensure that investors get some of the best stocks to buy and hold for 20 years or more. Considering the above, we have compiled a list of some good bargain stock options for investors heading into August.12 Best Bargain Stocks To Buy in AugustImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyTo select the stocks for our list, we used a stock screener to first find stocks with P/E ratios below 20.

Humana and Elevance Health were down during the quarter because of commentary from UnitedHealth Group Incorporated management indicating that medical cost trends were running at the high end of their guidance driven by higher levels of outpatient medical activity, particularly among Medicare patients. We think UnitedHealth, Humana, and Elevance will be able to manage through an uptick in medical cost trends, but we modestly reduced our positions in Humana and Elevance due to the potential impact on earnings.We continue to own UnitedHealth, Humana Inc., and Elevance Health, Inc. because we believe these companies will be able to manage through this period without a material earnings impact, but we did modestly reduce our positions in Humana and Elevance Health.”8.

Any number of examples between large cap tech companies and more mature companies could illustrate this very same point, but we find this specific case most interesting because of its history.Note that in late 2014/early 2015 these multiples crossed one another. The relative harmony between Alphabet and Autozone lasted for just shy of a year at that time, before Alphabet’s shares surged and Autozone’s shares slumped. This relationship need not matter for markets, though we think there is some signal for investors. Autozone today trades at the highest multiples of its recent history, while Alphabet trades at its lowest. Meanwhile, despite growth estimates dropping considerably at Alphabet and appreciating modestly at Autozone, Alphabet will outgrow Autozone by a wide margin over the next five years…” (Click here to read the full text)6.

These Non-GAAP measures may differ from those used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP. These Non-GAAP measures are used by the Company to measure its performance and may differ from those used by other companies.Management believes that these Non-GAAP measures are helpful as they provide a measure of the results of operations, and are frequently used by investors and analysts to evaluate the Company’s performance exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period, and which may not be indicative of past or future performance of the Company.Organic SalesThe Company defines ""organic sales"" as the reported net sales adjusted for: (1) net sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition; (2) net sales attributable to disposed businesses or discontinued product lines in both the current and prior year periods; and (3) the impact of foreign currency changes, which is calculated by translating current period net sales using the comparable prior period's foreign currency exchange rates.Adjusted Operating IncomeAdjusted operating income is computed by excluding the following items from operating income (loss) as reported in accordance with US GAAP:(1) Business combination related costs and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include costs related to consummating and integrating acquired businesses, as well as net gains and losses related to the disposed businesses. In addition, this category includes the post-acquisition roll-off of fair value adjustments recorded related to business combinations, except for amortization expense of purchased intangible assets noted below. Although the Company is regularly engaged in activities to find and act on opportunities for strategic growth and enhancement of product offerings, the costs associated with these activities may vary significantly between periods based on the timing, size and complexity of acquisitions and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company.(2) Restructuring related charges and other costs. These adjustments include costs related to the implementation of restructuring initiatives, including but not limited to, severance costs, facility closure costs, and lease and contract termination costs, as well as related professional service costs associated with these restructuring initiatives and global transformation activity. The Company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency; consequently, restructuring charges may recur but are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity, and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company. Other costs include charges related to goodwill and intangible asset impairments, legal settlements, executive separation costs, and changes in accounting principle recorded within the period. This category also includes costs related to the recent investigations, related ongoing legal matters and associated remediation activities which primarily include legal, accounting and other professional service fees, as well as turnover and other employee-related costs.(3) Amortization of purchased intangible assets. This adjustment excludes the periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets, which are recorded at fair value. Although these costs contribute to revenue generation and will recur in future periods, their amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions, and as such may not be indicative of the future performance of the Company.(4) Fair value and credit risk adjustments. These adjustments include the non-cash mark-to-market changes in fair value associated with pension assets and obligations, and equity-method investments. Although these adjustments are recurring in nature, they are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in the underlying assumptions and market conditions. The non-service component of pension expense is a recurring item, however it is subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in actuarial assumptions, interest rates, plan changes, settlements, curtailments, and other changes in facts and circumstances. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company.Adjusted Net Income (Loss)Adjusted net income (loss) consists of net income (loss) as reported in accordance with US GAAP, adjusted to exclude the items identified above. Additionally, income tax expense is adjusted for the related income tax impacts of the items named above, as well as other adjustments such as: discrete adjustments to valuation allowances and other uncertain tax positions, final settlement of income tax audits, discrete tax items resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives and the windfall or shortfall relating to exercise of employee share-based compensation, any difference between the interim and annual effective tax rate, and adjustments relating to prior periods.These adjustments are irregular in timing, and the variability in amounts may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.Adjusted EBITDA and MarginIn addition to the adjustments described above in arriving at adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA is computed by further excluding any remaining interest expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization.Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by net sales.Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Diluted ShareAdjusted earnings (loss) (EPS) per diluted share is computed by dividing adjusted earnings (loss) attributable to Dentsply Sirona shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding.Adjusted Free Cash Flow ConversionThe Company defines adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures during the same period, and adjusted free cash flow conversion is defined as adjusted free cash flow divided by adjusted net income (loss). Management believes this Non-GAAP measure is important for use in evaluating the Company’s financial performance as it measures our ability to efficiently generate cash from our business operations relative to earnings. It should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net income (loss) as a measure of our performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.DENTSPLY SIRONA INC.

And now I'll turn it over to Charlie.Story continuesCharles Frederick LowreyThank you, Bob, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our second quarter results reflect continued momentum across our businesses, including the fourth consecutive quarter of underlying earnings growth and record operating earnings for group insurance. We continue to execute on our strategy by reducing market sensitivity and increasing our capital flexibility, enhancing our capabilities and optimizing operating efficiency to support long-term growth.Our strategic progress and financial strength position us well to navigate the current macroeconomic environment and maintain our disciplined approach to capital deployment.Turning to Slide 3. I'll start this morning by noting 2 significant milestones demonstrating how we are reducing market sensitivity and increasing our capital flexibility. During the second quarter, we completed a reinsurance transaction for a $10 billion block of traditional variable annuities and received proceeds of $650 million. With this transaction, I'm pleased that we have achieved our objective of lowering the proportion of traditional variable annuities while continuing our progress in pivoting to less market-sensitive and higher-growth products. Additionally, last week, we announced another transaction to reinsure a $12.5 billion block of guaranteed universal life policies, which will be accretive to earnings. We expect to receive approximately $450 million of proceeds when the transaction closes, which is expected to be in the fourth quarter of this year.We also continue to deliver on our vision to increase access to investing insurance and retirement security by enhancing our capabilities and customer experiences and by expanding our distribution channels and products to more people around the world. In Latin America, we continue to expand our distribution through the Mercado Libre platform and added 150,000 new customers last quarter. Also, Prudential of Brazil achieved a record sales quarter, driven by strong performance by Life Planners and continued expansion of the third-party distribution channel.Prudential of Brazil is now the third largest life insurance company in the country, growing at twice the market average and reaching more than 3.5 million customers. In addition, we see continued opportunity and feel we are well positioned in the international longevity risk transfer market as we completed more than $3.5 billion of transactions in the second quarter.In the U.S. our Individual Retirement Strategies business achieved annuity sales of $1.9 billion in the second quarter, a 20% increase year-over-year and the highest since the fourth quarter of 2020. Our FlexGuard suite has reached $15 billion of sales over the past 3 years, and our fixed annuity sales in the quarter represented over 1/3 of new business as we innovate our portfolio of annuity solutions to meet customer needs. As we look ahead, we are well positioned as a global leader at the intersection of asset management and insurance. We are confident that our strategy and mutually reinforcing business mix, which leverages the combined strength of our brand, global asset and liability origination capabilities and multichannel distribution will enable us to drive future growth and continue to expand access to investing insurance and retirement security. At the same time, we continued to enhance the ways we leverage technology to improve customer experiences and optimize operating efficiency.One recent example is model my retirement, a new digital tool designed to help institutional pension customers gain a better understanding of their retirement benefits and adjust their financial planning accordingly. Customers can now quickly and seamlessly get an estimate of their available annuity benefits through our self-service website. We also announced a strategic partnership with [NAIA], a leading benefits experience platform. The new partnership will allow group insurance clients to harness AI and data science capabilities to make more informed workplace benefit decisions. And we are also using chatbot technology and robotic process automation to reduce transaction processing time across our U.S. businesses.As part of our continuous improvement framework, we are focusing on creating a leaner, faster and more agile company so that we can better meet the needs of our customers while driving growth and efficiency. We've made good progress in this area, having exceeded the target we established 2 years ago, but we think there's more work we can do. We are evaluating additional opportunities, including further evolving our operating model, simplifying our organizational structure and streamlining decision-making.Turning now to Slide 4. Prudential's rock-solid balance sheet and robust risk and capital management frameworks have allowed us to confidently navigate the current macro environment. Our AA financial strength is supported by our strong capital position, including approximately $50 billion of unrealized insurance margins, $4.5 billion in highly liquid assets at the end of the second quarter, which does not include the $650 million of proceeds from the traditional variable annuities reinsurance transaction that was completed this quarter and a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio and disciplined approach to asset liability management.Moving to Slide 5. Our disciplined approach to capital deployment coupled with the added capital flexibility achieved through our de-risking transactions enables us to effectively balance investing in the long-term growth of our businesses with returning capital to shareholders. In the second quarter, we returned approximately $700 million in capital to shareholders. And with that, Rob will now provide an overview of our second quarter financial results and an update on our business performance.Robert Michael FalzonThank you, Charlie. I'll provide an overview of our financial results and business performance for our PGIM, U.S. and international businesses. I'll begin on Slide 6 with our financial results for the second quarter of 2023. Our pretax adjusted operating income was $1.4 billion or $2.94 per share on an after-tax basis. These results reflect underlying business growth, including the benefits from a higher interest rate environment and favorable underwriting experience partially offset by elevated expenses and lower variable investment and fee income.Our GAAP net income was (inaudible) million lower than our after-tax adjusted operating income primarily driven by marked-to-market losses on currency and interest rate derivatives and losses on fixed maturity sales, driven by higher rates. Turning to the operating results from our businesses compared to the year ago quarter. PGIM, our global investment manager, had lower asset management fees driven by rising rates and net outflows and higher expenses to support growth initiatives, while other related revenues increased primarily from higher seed and co-investment earnings. Results of our U.S. businesses primarily reflected in a more favorable, comparable impact from our annual assumption update, higher spread income and more favorable underwriting, partially offset by the absence of a onetime gain from the sale of PALAC in the prior year quarter and lower fee income. The increase in earnings in our international businesses primarily reflected higher emerging markets earnings and a favorable impact from our annual assumption update and other refinements.Turning to Slide 7. PGIM, our global active investment manager has diversified capabilities in both public and private asset classes across fixed income, equities and alternatives. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains attractive with 80% or more of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over the last 5- and 10-year periods. In addition, our short-term performance has improved since the last quarter with 80% of assets exceeding their benchmarks over a 1-year period. PGIM experienced third-party net outflows of $5.2 billion in the quarter, primarily from public equity strategies. Institutional outflows were primarily driven by client redemptions for liquidity needs and retail outflows were driven by sub-advised equity mandates.As the investment engine of Prudential, the success and growth of PGIM and of our U.S. and international insurance and retirement businesses are mutually reinforcing. PGIM's asset origination capabilities, investment management expertise, and access to institutional and other sources of private capital or a competitive advantage, helping our businesses bring enhanced solutions and create more value for our customers. Our insurance and retirement businesses, in turn, provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated net flows as well as unique access to insurance liabilities. In addition, we continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions, our private alternatives and credit business, which has assets of approximately $234 billion across private corporate and infrastructure credit, real estate equity and debt and secondary private equity. Capital deployment across PGIM's private assets platform increased from the prior quarter to $8 billion, benefiting from strong private placement and direct lending originations. Turning to Slide 8. Our U.S. businesses produced diversified earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income and benefit from our complementary mix of longevity and mortality businesses. We continue to drive towards a higher value, higher growth and less market-sensitive mix of earnings as evidenced by the derisking transactions that Charlie mentioned, invest in our businesses to deliver best-in-class customer experiences and expand our addressable market with new financial solutions, leveraging the capabilities across Prudential. Retirement strategies generated strong sales of $7.6 billion in the second quarter across it's institutional and individual lines of business. Our Institutional Retirement business has leading market capabilities, which helped to produce second quarter sales of $5.7 billion, including $3.6 billion of international reinsurance transactions as well as strong stable value sales. Retirement account values were a record high at the end of the second quarter. In Individual Retirement, our product pivots have resulted in continued strong sales of more simplified solutions like FlexGuard and FlexGuard Income, representing approximately 65% of sales and increased fixed annuity sales that accounted for approximately 1/3 of sales this quarter. Our Individual Life sales increased 27% from the year ago quarter, reflecting our earlier product pivot strategy with variable life products representing approximately 74% of sales in the quarter. And group insurance sales were up 33% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by growth in disability and supplemental health. We've been very pleased with the momentum we are seeing in our group insurance business as we execute our strategy of product and segment diversification while leveraging technology to increase operating efficiency and enhance the customer experience. Our record results this quarter include favorable group life and disability underwriting experience, which resulted in a benefit ratio of 81%. Turning to Slide 9. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance companies, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other businesses aimed at expanding our presence in targeted high-growth emerging markets. In Japan, we are focused on providing high-quality service and expanding our distribution and product offerings. Our needs-based approach and protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers as we expand our product offerings to meet their evolving needs. In emerging markets, we are focused on creating a selective portfolio of businesses in regions where customer needs are growing, where there are compelling opportunities to build market-leading businesses and where the financial enterprise can add value. Our international business sales were up 9% compared to the year ago quarter. Life Planner sales were up 12%, driven by record sales in Brazil as well as higher single premium U.S. dollar sales in Japan. Gibraltar sales were up 6%, primarily driven by growth in the bank channel. As we look ahead, we are well positioned across our businesses to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance and retirement security. We continue to focus on investing in growth businesses and markets, delivering industry-leading customer experiences and creating the next generation of financial solutions to serve the diverse needs of a broad range of customers. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Ken.Kenneth Yutaka TanjiThanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter of 2023 relative to our second quarter results. As noted, pretax adjusted operating income in the second quarter was $1.4 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.94 on an after-tax basis. To get a sense of how our third quarter results might develop, we suggest adjustments for the following items: First, our annual assumption update and other refinements resulted in a net benefit of $16 million in the second quarter. Next, variable investment income was below expectations in the second quarter by $50 million. While we have not included an adjustment for the third quarter, the potential exists for continued revaluation of real estate investments and lower prepayment activity due to the current market and economic conditions. Variable investment income will vary from period to period. However, over time, it has exceeded our expectations. Third, underwriting experience was below expectations by $5 million in the second quarter, and we expect $20 million of favorable seasonality in the third quarter. And last, we included an adjustment of $90 million for other items, primarily due to elevated expenses in the second quarter. These adjustments combined get us to a baseline of $3.26 per share for the third quarter. I'll note, if you exclude items specific to the third quarter, earnings per share would be $3.35.The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power continued to improve due to business growth, including the benefit of higher interest rates, partially offset by higher investments in our capabilities and growth initiatives. I would also note that due to continued opportunities to build capabilities, pursue growth initiatives and gain efficiency, we expect an increased level of investments in these areas that will be reflected in corporate and other. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. Turning to Slide 11. Our capital position continues to support our AA financial strength rating. Our cash and liquid assets were $4.5 billion at the high end of our liquidity target range. Our regulatory capital ratios were well above our targets, and we have substantial off-balance sheet resources, including $9 billion of contingent capital and liquidity facilities. We remain thoughtful in our capital deployment, balancing preservation of financial strength and flexibility, investment in our businesses and shareholder distributions. Turning to Slide 12. And in summary, we are transforming our business for sustainable growth. We continue to navigate the current macro environment with the financial strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, and we maintain a balanced and disciplined approach to capital deployment. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperatorThank you. We'll now be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI.Thomas George GallagherFirst question is, can you talk a little bit about the dividend flows? The dividends that were paid up in the quarter from the subs, it seemed like a pretty strong capital generation quarter. So a little bit behind what drove that. And relatedly, the capital that you're going to be -- that you received for the VA transaction or the freed up capital and the SGL deals later this year, would you expect to be able to dividend those up and use the proceeds? And then finally, the IMR rule change, can you comment on whether that affected your RBC this quarter? Do you expect that to affect it later in the year?Kenneth Yutaka TanjiTom, it's Ken. Yes, we executed planned distributions from our businesses in the second quarter. That cash flow reflected dividends from PICA and Japan and other affiliated cash flows from subsidiaries as well. And again, it was all part of our plans for the year. Our capital position as a result is very healthy. Our regulatory capital ratios are above our AA objectives that would include the benefit of the recent VA reinsurance transaction, but does not yet reflect the GUL transaction, which will be subject to close later. And again, our HoldCo assets were $4.5 billion, relatively flat from the prior quarter and the high end of our target range. So again, we'll benefit from the GUL transaction when it closes and the NAIC IMR proposal when that is adopted. So that's not yet in our RBC ratios. And these will all be key considerations for dividends from PICA to PFI in the second half of the year, again, with the close of GUL and the NAIC's decision on negative IMR. So overall, we feel very good about our capital position and the outlook for our flexibility looking ahead.Thomas George GallagherOkay. And then just a follow-up. On the potential IMR changes, I think the limitation is now looking like 10% of surplus. Can you give a little bit of color for -- I think you had, had something like $1.8 billion negative impact from that in 2022, would you expect to be able to reverse most of that? Some of that? And would we still be looking at potential limitations or future losses if rates keep going up here? I guess is the other follow-up on that.Kenneth Yutaka TanjiYes. So you're right, Tom. The proposal is subject to a limitation of 10% of statutory surplus with adjusted for some exclusions. And for us, that's about $1.3 billion or that you can think of that as about 26 RBC points. So that's what it would represent for us where we sit and where interest rate sits right now.OperatorYour next question is coming from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.Jamminder Singh BhullarSo first, just a question on your Japan business and how do you -- how are you thinking about potential changes in your new sales mix given changes in the capital regime and also just fluctuations recently we've seen in terms of interest rates and currencies in Japan?Andrew Francis SullivanJimmy, it's Andy. I'll take your question. Our Japan operation, as you know, is competitively advantaged with outstanding distribution, great product and a strong brand. And we've been quite pleased with the sales results this quarter as we experienced year-over-year growth in our LP, our LC and our bank channels. That growth was aided by higher U.S. dollar product sales. But we've also been investing into the business. Clearly, our work on innovating our product designs and enhancing our customer experience is paying off. As we look at the interest rate changes, -- as we always say, overall higher interest rates are good for Prudential and are good for our Japanese businesses. We do believe that those higher interest rates will obviously give us greater flexibility in our product design and then delivering value back to our customers. So while we may see a shift of the mix between U.S. dollar and Yen denominated, we think we'll still see strong demand. And as we look forward, we're optimistic about our ability to continue to grow the Japan business and deliver shareholder value.Jamminder Singh BhullarDoes the change in capital affect your sort of the economics of your products between U.S. dollar and Yen denominated.Robert Michael FalzonJimmy, it's Rob. So a couple of thoughts. You're referring to the eventual adoption of ESR. First point, ESR is still a work in process and is not scheduled for adoption until like 2025. And so we continue to work with the (inaudible) and with the industry to fine-tune the ESR regime, which is, to date, largely mirrored the regime that's been established on the international side. As currently constructed, it would cause us to look creatively at how we manage our book of business and our sales. So I don't think it would necessarily change our distribution and our sales, but where we hold the assets against those sales could be in Japan or it could be reinsured to other jurisdictions in order to be able to make sure that we're matching the economics of the products that we're selling into the economics of the statutory regimes in which they reside. So we're comfortable that either through a combination of efficacy and getting sort of the right economic outcomes and/or the other levers that we have available to us that we'll be able to sort of continue the balance of sales that we have and sort of manage the way in which we capitalize and reserve those sales.Jamminder Singh BhullarOkay. And then just shifting on to PGIM. The negative flows this quarter. How much of that is something that's maybe prudential related that might continue into the second half versus maybe just overall industry-wide issues that a lot of your peers have had in asset management recently as well?Andrew Francis SullivanJimmy, it's Andy. I'll take your question, and I'll just hit it broadly to talk about flows for the quarter. As we've talked about flows and outcome of having great distribution, broadly diversified products and strong investment results. And we've been a net flow winner over a multiyear period in PGIM, and we're quite confident in the strength of our capabilities. And as always, we're going to continue to manage this for the long term.That said, this quarter, we did see a material reduction in our outflows versus the previous quarters. On the retail end, outflows were $2.2 billion and were predominantly an equity story. We've seen retail clients rebalancing their portfolios based on the heels of strong equity market appreciation. On the institutional side, the outflows were $3 billion for the quarter. Again, that's a material improvement over the previous quarters. These outflows included both equity and fixed income. The equity story for Institutional is the same as that for retail. It's client rebalancing. For fixed income, we saw some of our clients make asset allocation changes and other shift to passive. As far as an outlook, near term, we expect that this current investor behavior is going to continue. And to your question, our trend is consistent with what we're seeing across the rest of the industry. Over the longer term, we have a lot of confidence in our PGIM platform, and we know that we're going to return to strong positive flows and gain market share.OperatorOur next question is coming from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler.John Bakewell BarnidgeQuestion on PGIM. I know they're an investment manager on some of these risk transferred assets. How long does that agree -- those agreements last? Can you talk about how the wind down of those assets would work?Andrew Francis SullivanJohn, it's Andy. I'll take it. Maybe I'll bring it up a level, just talk about in general as we do derisking transactions. And in particular, the recent derisking transactions we did in Individual Retirement Strategies and Individual Life. It is true, we'll lose some assets under management from the general account. But we -- as you've noted, we worked hard and got an IMA. That is deal specific, how long the -- those IMAs go depending deal to deal. But it does give us the ability to continue to manage a majority of the assets. And at the end of the day, if you look across the risk transactions that we've done recently, it's not really going to have a material impact on PGIM earnings.Robert Michael FalzonJohn, it's Rob. Maybe just a little further elaboration. In the reinsurance of the PDI transaction, recall that those are individual sort of clients separate accounts. And so those -- the separate account business there is something that PGIM will continue to manage. With regard to the GUL business, the agreement that we have there is actually a 7-year initial IMA. And obviously, with good performance, we would expect to continue to be able to manage that even over a longer period of time.John Bakewell BarnidgeAnd then my follow-up question, sticking with asset management business. Your industry-wide headwinds lead to inorganic opportunities? And are there products or geographies you'd want to get greater scale in?Andrew Francis SullivanJohn, it's Andy again. I'll take that. So -- and I'll start where I always start when we talk about this. We've demonstrated a strong ability over a couple of decades to grow PGIM organically. So we -- certainly, as we look at the programmatic M&amp;A, we don't need it to grow. That being said, we do remain interested in augmenting the organic growth plans with programmatic M&amp;A. If you look at what we've done recently, Montana Capital Partners, PGIM Custom Harvest and now Deerpath, those are really good examples of the areas that we said we are going to lean into higher fee, higher growth. As we look forward, we're going to continue to work to globalize the business and lean into areas like private alternatives and real assets. Clearly, any disruptive environment can lead to opportunities. So we make sure that we stay in the now and in the flow of what's going on in the industry. But as always, we will remain very patient and be disciplined in our approach.OperatorNext question today is coming from Ryan Krueger from KBW.Ryan Joel KruegerI was hoping you could discuss the new open architecture platform that was referenced in the June press release and give some more specifics on really what you're looking to do there?Robert Michael FalzonRyan, it's Rob. I'll take that. As we've talked about in the past, we see really interesting opportunities that exist in the intersection of asset management and insurance, you see evolving in the industry, and we're quite excited about what that implies for our ability to create avenues of growth, both in our insurance and our asset management businesses. So we're being thoughtful about how we execute against that opportunity and that includes organizing ourselves in a way so as to institutionalize our ongoing balance sheet optimization capability. So think about that on the liability side is we're looking at reinsurance solutions to balance the use of captives, affiliates and third-party reinsurance to continue to actively evaluate additional blocks, existing blocks of business for reinsurance and then also looking at flow or new sales solutions. On the asset side, it's about expanding our lens on the available assets or investments that can generate greater outlook for us. We're also expanding our capabilities to source those investments, either directly or in partnership with others, including things like acquiring capabilities as we did with Deer Path. This is an important component of our broader strategy, which is around enhancing valuation by becoming higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble.Ryan Joel KruegerAnd just one follow-up there. I mean should we think of this as also including potential to bring in more third-party capital in a sidecar like structured to back some of your new business in the future?Robert Michael FalzonI think we're looking at the full range of opportunities that would exist there. And so going from captive to third party and hybrid solutions that would exist in between that.OperatorOur next question is coming from Wes Carmichael from Wells Fargo.Wesley Collin CarmichaelI just had a follow-up on Tom's question on the HoldCo liquidity. So I think in the first quarter, that was roughly around $4.5 billion ended this quarter at $4.5 billion. But if I kind of add up all the uses of capital in the quarter from buybacks, dividends, I think there was $1.5 billion of callable debt. I think there were around $2.5 billion of uses in the period. So I'm just curious, like, were dividends accelerated? I know you said that they were planned, but was there any other affiliated borrowings? I'm just trying to square that because it's a pretty sizable use of capital. I'm just trying to figure out where that came from?Kenneth Yutaka TanjiYes. Wes, it's Ken. No, it was all planned. So the distributions we received were all planned, and we didn't issue any debt in the quarter either. In fact, as you recognize, we called some debt, which again was all planned. So -- and we didn't pull forward anything. So it was all part of what our plans were for the year. So I hope that helps.Wesley Collin CarmichaelOkay. And just maybe any thoughts around your kind of PRT pipeline and just maybe how you think about that versus balancing that with like the longevity business and deploying capital to those 2 in the institutional retirement business?Caroline Ann FeeneyIt's Caroline, and I'll take your question. So first of all, I'd say, overall, we're very pleased with the strong results we saw across our entire Retirement Strategies business with just over $7.5 billion in total sales and record institutional account values of $259 billion. This included $5.7 billion in our institutional retirement strategies business, highlighted by a strong quarter in international reinsurance transactions. In terms of the pipeline overall, Wes, we continue to see strong opportunity in both the U.S. and global risk transfer markets with strong funding positions, both above 100% and also high intent to transact. And I would be remiss not to mention what was just announced yesterday that we were selected to secure the pension benefits for about 2,000 of PSV (inaudible) retirees and their beneficiaries. And so far, we've seen a record first half of the year in PRT, And while we expect to see a strong second half, we don't expect to surpass last year's record pipeline. We also see an extremely strong pipeline in the U.K. with funded positions over 110%. And, Wes, finally, I'd say that given our expertise and our ability to manage large complex transactions along with our financial strength, we are well positioned to remain a leader in both markets.OperatorNext question today is coming from Suneet Kamath from Jefferies.Suneet Laxman L. KamathI wanted to go back to the risk transfer deals just for a second. I think, Charlie, in your comments that you talked about achieving your goal on the VA side. And obviously, you've done an SGL transaction of late. Should we think about this as still ongoing activity for you? Or are you sort of declaring victory here and kind of moving on to some of the more growth-oriented areas of your strategy?Charles Frederick LowreySo I would say, yes, to both of those. So let me go through -- yes and, Suneet. So first, I'll go through each 1 sort of GUL and then the VA business. But first, we are very pleased with the valuation we received for reinsuring the $12.5 billion block of guaranteed universal life policies that we announced last week. And as we said, we expect to receive approximately $450 million of proceeds when the transaction closes. The transaction will be accretive to earnings and will also reduce our market sensitivity and increase our capital flexibility. But would we consider an additional de-risking opportunity for Life subblock? Absolutely, as long as it met the strategic financial objectives and made sense to all our stakeholders. However, we're going to be disciplined in our approach as the individual life business continues to be core to our purpose. There's still significant potential for growth in the industry with a $12 trillion life insurance gap. And I think our strong Individual Life sales in the second quarter reflects our product pivot to less market-sensitive products. And from an enterprise perspective, our Life business helps balance our longevity with our mortality, so it remains important to us. On the VA side, it's a little bit of a different story, but there are some similarities. So we've made considerable progress in reducing the market sensitivity and increasing our capital flexibility through the 2 transactions we've done, and we're pleased with the valuations, again, that we received for reinsuring the $10 billion block of traditional variable annuities in the second quarter as well as the valuation for the $30 billion block we sold last year. But as a result of these transactions, as we've said, and the natural runoff of this business, we have achieved the original objective that we established 2 years ago of lowering the proportion of traditional variable annuities. So we're not in a position of having to do another transaction. Having said that, I want to be very clear that we'll continue to explore additional opportunities. But again, to state the obvious, but I'll state it, we'll only do something if it's in the best interest of all our stakeholders. But these transactions aren't only about de-risking. As you said, they're also about growth. So while we've been quite successful in our de-risking efforts as part of our strategy, we've also been equally focused on growing with less market-sensitive products in our businesses, which you've seen over the past few quarters. So let me turn it over to Caroline for a minute because -- Caroline, would you want to talk about some of the progress we've made with that part of our strategy?Caroline Ann FeeneyYes. Sure, Charlie. I'd be happy to talk about how we're growing both these businesses. So first of all, in the Life business, as you said, we have a $12 trillion insurance gap. So we have a strong growth path forward, particularly when you think about the 50 million Americans who are currently underinsured. And as you mentioned, Charlie, we've been very successful in pivoting our businesses to products that have a more favorable risk profile. Our new solutions have less embedded guarantees. They're less capital intensive, and we're writing new business at attractive returns. And as part of that, we saw strong sales in the quarter, up more than 25% over the prior year. And then on the individual retirement strategy side, we also continue to deliver strong sales and earnings. And in fact, we had our stronger sales quarter since the fourth quarter of 2020 and roughly a 20% increase over the prior year, and that's anchored by our FlexGuard suite of index variable annuities where we now have over $15 billion in cumulative sales, reinforcing our leadership position as a top 5 player. And, we also saw strong growth in our fixed annuity solutions, which were roughly 1/3 of our sales in the quarter and a significant increase over the prior year. So I'd say that our de-risking transactions, along with our product pivots, have put us in a position to be more nimble with less market sensitivity and we see a meaningful opportunity for strong growth in both businesses going forward.Suneet Laxman L. KamathGot it. That makes sense. And then I just want to follow up. I think, Ken, in your prepared remarks, towards the end of your commentary, you talked about an increased level of investment, I think, in the corporate segment. I was just wondering if you could maybe size that and then some thoughts around for how long should we expect this incremental investment to be impacting that line?Kenneth Yutaka TanjiSure. The -- what I mentioned there was we have found new opportunities to invest in our capabilities and including growth opportunities and to gain efficiency. It's building on the programs that we've executed in the past and we have increased our investment level there. We've put a placeholder in there in terms of our run rate of about an increase of about $25 million a quarter. And so that's -- given our plans now, we think that's appropriately planned increase in the pace of that. I just want to mention that the way we look at these opportunities is they're often company-wide, and that's why you see the expenses occurring in corporate, but the benefits then are reflected in our business segments. And then overall, from an expense level standpoint, we've maintained basically a flat level of expenses, while we've increased the level of capacity to invest in growth and capabilities and efficiencies, the efficiencies that we've gained there given us that capacity. And so overall, we've seen a flat level of expenses, improved level of capabilities, gained efficiencies and improved margins.Suneet Laxman L. KamathGot it. So you're not signaling that we need to reflect this $25 million in our corporate forecast going forward, it's more -- you're going to have this, but it's going to be offset by efficiencies and other things?Kenneth Yutaka TanjiWell, yes. But if you think about corporate, you should think about that as being an ongoing level of spend in corporate.Suneet Laxman L. KamathGot it. Just offset at the segments.Kenneth Yutaka TanjiYes.OperatorNext question is coming from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research.Erik James BassCan you provide an update on share emerging markets businesses and what they're currently contributing to earnings and how they're growing from a bottom line perspective?Andrew Francis SullivanSo Erik, it's all -- Andy. It's Andy. I'll take the question. Let me just start by kind of reminding everyone of the strategy. Our focus on emerging markets is part of shifting our overall business mix to be higher growth. And we're quite pleased with the performance of our EM portfolio, which is obviously, and as you could see, steadily growing and positively contributing to our earnings profile.I would highlight a couple of areas. We're very pleased with our results in Brazil and quite optimistic about our prospects. Brazil posted strong double-digit year-over-year sales growth with success across basically every channel Life Planner, Third-party and Group, and we had another record quarter. Second, I would highlight our Habitat joint venture has contributed steady growth since the acquisition in 2016. As of the end of the second quarter, total Habitat assets under management is $67 billion. That makes us #1 in Chile and #2 overall in Latin America. Third, we're continuing to invest in emerging Asia and Africa. And then finally, and Charlie mentioned this sort of at the top of the call was this really exciting partnership we have with Mercado Pago, which is for financial subsidiary of Mercado Libre. Mercado Libre is the largest e-commerce system in Latin America and has given us access to the mass market in Latin America, and we're seeing really nice growth there. So we don't necessarily break out the specific growth rates, but this is a portfolio that's becoming quite meaningful, with our particular emphasis being on how Brazil and Latin America are growing. And as we look forward, we really do believe we're in the right spot at the right time, and that growth will continue.Erik James BassAnd then on PGIM, I was just hoping you could talk about the drivers of the other related revenues and your outlook for the second half of the year? I think the baseline outlook assumes that these normalize. So is that an expectation or just a modeling assumption?Andrew Francis SullivanSo thanks, Erik, it's Andy again. I will talk about the quarter, and then I'll talk about the outlook. In the second quarter, ORR came in at $31 million, which was about $20 million below our average expectation. The bottom line there is the slowdown in the real estate market is playing through as we predict it, and we've seen lower agency earnings, lower real estate transactions, fees and lower incentive fees. As far as looking forward, we would expect near term to see pressure remain on the ORR line really until the market experiences a rebound in the real estate transaction volumes.OperatorOur next question is coming from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays.Tracy Dolin-BenguiguiLet's talk about RBC improvements. I appreciate that you quantify the IMR relief. How many RBC points are you expecting from your VA deal and [ULSG] deal?Kenneth Yutaka TanjiTracy, it's Ken. The VA deal, it's -- the 650 is about 13 RBC points and the 450 from the GUL deal is about 9 RBC points. So that's the quantum expressed in RBC.Tracy Dolin-BenguiguiOkay. Awesome. When I'm thinking about these transactions and the counterparty credit risk, do you look at the size of capital by reinsurer? Let's just put the ratings aside, like the Somerset Re capital base feels a little bit light. You did say there was over collateralization, but I don't think there's a comfort trust. What mechanisms do you put in place to reduce recapture risk? And if you could also share any assumptions at Somerset like with that deal?Kenneth Yutaka TanjiSure, Tracy. It's Ken. A number of things there. So let me cover them if I miss them, make sure I come back to them. But -- Overall, we utilize reinsurance in our counterparties very carefully. We spread our reinsurance across a select group of high-quality third-party reinsurers. And as you would expect, we have standards for that reinsurance that we certainly apply to these transactions. While they're entering into the business, they do have experience. The management team of these reinsurers have a lot of industry experience and are committed to the business in the long term. But beyond that, we have contractual provisions, some of which you alluded to. But I also want to highlight that we'll be doing the administration of the business. So we have complete control over that. And the reserves for the business, in one instance, will be in a comfort trust and the other to the structure, (inaudible) count, but they provide similar assurances and protections, and again, will be over-collateralized with the procedures for timely settlement. We also -- I want to highlight that have investment guidelines for the investment portfolios for the investments that are held in these trusts or accounts. So overall, when we put that all together, we think the counterparty risk is well positioned for us. I think I covered your questions there, but hopefully, that helps.Tracy Dolin-BenguiguiIt definitely does. If I could just slip in if there was any assumptions like mortality or lapse rates that Somerset like looking at the deal?Kenneth Yutaka TanjiYes. Obviously, those are their assumptions. Again, they have -- the people there on the other side with Somerset. They have a lot of experience, but they make their own assumptions. But also, they obviously are going to be subject to their own regulatory standards in the jurisdictions of which they operate. So this got a lot of regulatory attention on both their side and our side, and we think that's also in good standing.OperatorNext question is coming from Mike Ward from Citi.Michael Augustus WardReally appreciate all the commentary around the de-risking and simplification. I'm just curious, should we think about this as you guys are sort of saying you're open for considering more block deals or internal reinsurance restructuring whatnot? Or should we think about it as potentially more significant like a more material split or divestiture within the organization to unlock value?Charles Frederick LowreyMike, this is Charlie. I think it's really the former. In other words, if you think about what we're trying to do, if we take a step back and think about strategy of becoming a higher growth, less market-sensitive and more nimble company, this clearly falls as Caroline and I talked about in the first and second bucket. So we are de-risking and have de-risked and would consider further de-risking transactions if they make sense to stakeholders, but at the same time, using that as a way to pivot to becoming a higher-growth company.Michael Augustus WardThat's very helpful. Maybe on Group Insurance, it hasn't gotten much airtime. Results were pretty favorable as they have been for peers. Just curious if there's any sort of updated kind of annual go-forward earnings power for Group now?Caroline Ann FeeneyYes. So Mike, it's Caroline, and I'll take your questions. So certainly, I'll start by saying it was indeed a great quarter for Group Insurance. And as Charlie mentioned upfront, we saw record earnings and an overall benefit ratio of 81%. That reflects the execution of our strategy of product and segment diversification and our continued focus on profitability.Total disability new business premiums grew 24% year-to-date compared to the same period last year and our Supplemental Health business, a core component of our product diversification strategy also saw a strong double-digit growth. And our segment diversification strategy is focused on growing in the under 5,000 lives market. We've got great momentum with that segment now comprising about 1/4 of our block. We're also pleased to be achieving that diversification and growth without sacrificing profitability and pricing discipline. The current quarter also reflects favorable mortality experience in the working age population driven primarily from lower incidents and the impact from positive rate actions on renewals. And also disability continued to see strong results as well. That was driven by lower incidents, strong employment numbers and our continued focus on effective claim management. The disability benefits ratio we saw was our second best reported ever trailing only last quarter. So moving forward, Mike, we are confident in our Group business. We believe we're in a great position to continue executing on our strategy while continuing to grow in a disciplined and profitable manner. Because of this, you'll note that we've already increased our expectations for core earnings going forward.Charles Frederick LowreyMike, one other thing. It's Charlie. We talk a lot about the investments we're making in technology, processes, infrastructure and other things. And this is -- what's pleasing about this is that this is a tangible -- you can see a tangible outcome of some of the investments we're making, specifically in Group this time, but there are tangible outcomes we're beginning to see.OperatorWe reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Lowrey for any further or closing comments.Charles Frederick LowreyAll right. Thank you again for joining us today. We are making progress, transforming Prudential to deliver sustainable long-term growth and to meet the evolving needs of our customers. We are confident that our strategy and mutually reinforcing business mix will enable Prudential to become a leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security. Thank you again, and have a great day.OperatorThank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.]"

MuncriefThank you, Scott. Pleasure to be here this morning. We appreciate everyone taking the time to join us. Devon's second quarter performance can be defined as another one of solid execution on all fronts as our business continued to strengthen and build operational momentum throughout the quarter. The attractive per share growth we've consistently delivered quarter after quarter, demonstrates the efficiency of our disciplined business model, the quality of our Delaware focused asset portfolio and the team's execution capabilities and the benefits of our cash return framework. The chart on Slide 4 provides a very compelling visual of this success, showcasing our impressive track record of value creation. Since we unveiled the industry-first framework in late 2020, we have deployed $12 billion towards dividends, share buybacks, debt reduction and accretive bolt-on acquisitions. The cumulative value of these actions equate to nearly 2x the value of Devon's pro forma market capitalization from just a few years ago. As you can see from our diversified actions to date, we have carefully designed our cash return framework to be nimble with the flexibility to allocate free cash flow across multiple avenues to optimize financial results through the cycle. Importantly, this disciplined execution has been rewarded by the market with our equity performance, achieving the highest return of any stock in the entire S&amp;P 500 over this period. Now let's go through some of our second quarter highlights and operating trends in greater detail. Beginning with production, the team did a great job growing oil volumes by 8% on a year-over-year basis this past quarter. this result surpassed midpoint guidance expectations and for us set a new all-time high oil production record for the company by averaging 323,000 barrels per day in the quarter. Additionally, this volume growth was supported by an infrastructure that includes several strategic midstream assets that we have selectively invested in through the years and have taken equity stakes in an effort to enhance the result from our core E&amp;P operations. A key driver of this record-setting result was higher completion activity in the Delaware Basin. By leveraging the benefits of a temporary fourth frac crew and consistently improving cycle times, we were able to bring online 76 new Delaware wells in the quarter, which was a few more than we originally planned due to efficiency gains. Importantly, the well productivity from this batch of wells in Delaware was excellent and included a Wolfcamp B appraisal success that strengthens the depth and quality of our resource in the area. We also had a successful redevelopment test in the Eagle Ford and advanced a handful of other interesting appraisal projects across our diversified asset base that it reinforces our confidence in the resource upside that currently exist across our portfolio. Looking ahead, with higher levels of completion activity in the second quarter, we expect our production profile to continue to strengthen the upcoming third quarter. A good visual of this operational momentum can be seen on Slide 7, with oil volumes expected to grow to a range of 322,000 to 330,000 barrels per day in the upcoming quarter. As I touched on earlier, the capital spending to drive this growth trajectory was a touch ahead of expectations due to very strong execution from our drilling and completion teams that brought forward activity into the quarter. Clay will spend time and cover this topic later, but I am extremely proud to share that we've set several operational records at both the basin and company level, contributing to the record-setting drilled and completed feet per day metrics we have achieved year-to-date. In addition to our strong operating efficiencies, our business is also beginning to benefit from service cost deflation as contracts are refreshed. This is driven by reduced activity from natural gas-focused companies and private producers over the past few months resulted -- resulting in improved availability of services and cost deflation in virtually every category. Although this is a very dynamic environment, we've observed the most downward pressure to date in the areas of tubulars, rig rates, fuel and other miscellaneous drilling services that will begin to positively impact our cost structure as we enter the end of this year. We also anticipate price movement with pressure pumping, which is our largest cost category in a very near future. While it's still somewhat premature to say what and set what our firm outlook for 2024 is, our expectations for deflationary trends should continue. We have the potential for meaningful savings from peak well costs as pricing improvements gradually flow through our cost structure over the next year or so. With a free cash flow model that our business generated, we had another great quarter of cash returns. We returned $462 million to shareholders through our fixed plus variable dividend which we have paid out now for 12 consecutive quarters. We also have an active buyback program that resulted in the repurchase of nearly 4 million shares over the past 3 months. We believe this balance between dividends and buyback offers investors the powerful combination of an attractive yield and steady per share growth through the cycle. Now moving to Slide 11. With the progress that our business has made year-to-date, we are well on our way to meeting the capital objectives associated with our 2023 plan. The momentum we have established places us on track to deliver a production per share growth rate of approximately 9% for the year. Importantly, the activity required to fund this growth is self-funded at a $40 WTI price or approximately half of where we are today and is delivering returns on capital employed greater than 20% at today's commodity prices. While once again, it is too early to provide firm guidance for next year. The trajectory of our business sets us up for a strong outlook in 2024 as well. Given current market fundamentals, we plan to invest at levels that will sustain our productive capacity and any improvements that we see from lower service costs will accrue to our shareholders in the form of higher free cash flow generation. This disciplined pursuit of value over volume positions us to continue to deliver another year of differentiated cash returns and highly competitive returns on invested capital versus the broader market. And now with that, I'll now turn the call over to Clay to cover our operational highlights. Clay?Clay M. GasparThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter operating results demonstrated that our business is performing at a high level and building momentum as we head into the second half of the year. As Rick touched on, this positive trajectory is underpinned by improving capital efficiency from faster cycle times, improving service costs and positive appraisal results that will contribute to our production profile and financial results over the balance of this year and more significantly into 2024. Today, I plan to provide a brief overview of the second quarter results across our assets as well as highlight some upcoming catalysts. The most significant contributor to Devon's second quarter operating success, so once again, our franchise asset in the Delaware Basin. As you can see on Slide 8, more than 60% of our capital activity was deployed to this prolific basin, allowing us to run a consistent program of 16 rigs. With the fourth completion crew at work in the first half of the year, we were able to place 76 wells online in the second quarter, up more than 80% compared to the first quarter. This elevated completion activity grew our Delaware production to 420,000 BOE per day and is expected to underpin volume growth in the third quarter as well. While we had great results across our acreage position, a key project I would like to highlight from the quarter was our Mule development in Eddy County, New Mexico. We've talked in the past about the important appraisal work that we do each year with 10% to 20% of our capital budget. The Mule pad is an example to provide you some visibility into the fruits of this labor. This 11-well project successfully codeveloped multiple landing zones within the Wolfcamp with particularly exciting results from the appraisal of deeper Wolfcamp B benches. The initial results from these 6 wells targeting the Wolfcamp B landing zones average greater than 3,100 BOE per day with 44% oil cut. Per well recoveries are on trend to exceed 2 million barrels of oil equivalent. Importantly, these highly commercial appraisal results de-risk and enhance the economic expectations on approximately 100 Wolfcamp B locations in the Cotton Draw area. Furthermore, these deeper Wolfcamp locations are expected to be highly competitive within our capital allocation framework going forward. The Delaware team also continued to make progress advancing drilling and completions efficiencies across our operations in the basin. In the Wolfcamp, we improved drilling productivity by about 10% on a per foot basis over the past year, while some of our best spud release times for 2-mile laterals pushing below 15 days. Completion efficiencies have also steadily improved with our cycle times decreasing by 9% year-to-date and compared to 2022. Averaging a record completion pace of more than 2,200 feet per day in the quarter, this operational progress has been accomplished in conjunction with an even higher safety and environmental focus and expectation. The great work our team has done to drive improvements across the entire planning and execution of our resources, coupled with the broader service cost deflation trends are positioning our business to be even more efficient as we head into 2024. Moving to the Eagle Ford. Our 3-rig program resulted in 29 gross wells placed online during the quarter. This activity, which was concentrated in the recently acquired acreage in Karnes County, drove a 9% increase in productivity versus the previous quarter. This margin -- this high-margin growth was driven by strong well productivity achieved from a balanced mix of development and appraisal activity designed to refine the next stage of development for this prolific resource play.Our top development project in the quarter was headlined by our LP Butler pad. This 4-well pad developed a highly charged [scheme of pay] in the volatile oil window of the play that exceeded predrill expectations, reaching an impressive average 30-day rate of 3,600 BOE per day with a 56% oil cuts. On the appraisal front, a key success in the quarter was the [Crudwood] unit. This development project in Karnes County tested infill spacing ranging from 140 to 150 -- excuse me, 180-foot and roughly 30 wells per section. The initial 30-day rates from this package of wells averaged 2,000 BOE per day, resulting in highly commercial returns that adds to the depth and quality of our inventory in the play. Also, adding to the commerciality of this tighter spacing was our drilling performance where we broke a company record averaging over 2,000 feet per day, which included the fastest spud to rig release time in the company history of only 5.7 days.As we look to allocate capital for 2024 and beyond, the positive operating results we've achieved year-to-date served as valuable data points to optimize future development activity in the Eagle Ford and other -- and further deepens our convictions of the resource upside that a crop that exists across this entire field. Moving to the Williston. Volumes began to rebound in the second quarter, growing 4% quarter-over-quarter to 56,000 BOE per day. This growth was driven by improved weather, higher uptimes on existing producers and successful adjustments to completion and production techniques for some of the new well activity. These completion and production modifications consisted of change to a larger proppant size designed to mitigate mobility of sand and a shift in artificial lift techniques to improve well uptime.With the favorable flowback results on 2 pads that have deployed these techniques, we have high confidence that the well's productivity will improve as we see progress throughout the year. Looking at inventory, we now have more than 150 wells remaining and identified significant refrac opportunities across hundreds of producing wells in the field, providing us the optionality to deploy steady reinvestment in this play for multiple years to come. Turning to the Powder River Basin. The key objective of our 2023 program is to continue to appraise and methodically refine our understanding of the Niobrara so that we can optimize this resource for future development. With this focus, the team has made substantial progress over the last year, establishing repeatable commercial results with 3-mile laterals across a significant portion of our acreage in Converse County. Furthermore, since we're not observing any degradation in the results from 3-well spacing, we plan to test 4 well per section later this year. And lastly, we're also encouraged by the early flow rates from appraisal activity recently brought online in the northern portion of our leasehold position that could extend the Niobrara potential into [Campbell] County.I'll provide more updates on these tests in the coming quarters, but it's been evident that our 300,000-acre net acreage position in the Powder River Basin is providing Devon important resource catalyst for the future. Lastly, in the Anadarko Basin, production volumes grew 10% from the previous quarter, driven by the ramp-up in completion activity funded by a drilling carry from our Dow joint venture. The operational execution from this program was superb with well costs consistently coming in below pre-drill expectations and the initial flow rates from several wells exceeding 3,000 BOE per day. To date, we have only utilized approximately half of the 133 well carrier agreement we have in place with Dow. We anticipate the remaining carry will provide us sufficient runway to support our current pace of activity for the next 18 to 24 months, and we're open to expanding this scope of partnership as we successfully demonstrated in the past. For the remainder of 2023, we plan to bring on 10 new wells weighted towards year-end. In summary, I'm proud of the capital efficiency results that each of our asset teams are delivering during the quarter and the strong momentum that we have built heading into the second half of '23. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the financial review. Jeff?Jeffrey L. RitenourThanks, Clay. I'll spend my time today covering the key drivers of our second quarter financial results and provide some insights into our outlook for the rest of the year. Beginning with production, a key driver of second quarter volumes exceeding midpoint guidance was efficiency gains that compress cycle times, leading us to capture a few more days online than planned. Looking ahead, the benefits of higher completion activity from the Delaware in the first half of the year is expected to drive volumes -- oil volumes higher in the upcoming third quarter and leaves us on track to meet our volume targets for the full year as well. On the capital front, we've invested 55% of our budget year-to-date. This weighting to the first half of the year is due to higher completion activity driven by a fourth temporary frac crew in the Delaware Basin. With this temporary crew recently released, we expect a lower capital spending profile as we head into the second half of the year and remain confident in our capital spending guidance range for the full year. Regional oil pricing once again remained strong with realizations near WTI benchmark levels in the second quarter. We're also seeing strength in the oil price curve for the second half of 2023. This positive trend is providing a meaningful impact to our returns and cash flow generation capabilities with every $1 uplift in WTI resulting in about $100 million of additional annual cash flow for the company.Despite the strength we saw in oil pricing in the second quarter, we did experience weakness in both natural gas and NGL realizations. We do expect improved markets for gas and NGLs in the second half of the year, which should translate into better price realizations for us across the portfolio. Moving to operating expenses. Our field level costs were right in line with expectations for the quarter. However, we do expect a minor uptick in per unit cost in the second half of 2023, driven by our recently executed water handling joint venture in the Delaware Basin. Our new water JV provides us significant operational flexibility to enhance scale and multiple disposal options. In addition, the JV materially lowers our future midstream capital requirements in the area. Looking forward, our equity stake in the JV will provide us distributions over time, offsetting the incremental operating cost at the asset level. We could also choose to bring forward value by monetizing this asset at some point in the future. Cutting to the bottom line, we generated $1.4 billion of operating cash flow during the quarter. Combined with the low reinvestment rates to fund our disciplined capital program, we were able to generate free cash flow for the 12th straight quarter. Furthermore, we've delivered these results across a variety of market conditions showcasing the durability of our business strategy. With this free cash flow, our top priority was the return of capital to our shareholders. A key use of our excess cash in the quarter was the funding of our fixed plus variable dividend with the Board declaring a payout of $0.49 per share. This distribution will be paid at the end of September.h. With this free cash flow, our top priority was the return of capital to our shareholders. A key use of our excess cash in the quarter was the funding of our fixed plus variable dividend with the board declaring a payout of $0.49 per share. This distribution will be paid at the end of September. In addition to dividends, we also see great value in our equity and continue to be active buyers of our stock. During the quarter, we repurchased an additional $200 million of stock, bringing our year-to-date total to approximately $750 million. With the authorization we have in place, we remain on pace to repurchase approximately 9% of our outstanding shares by the end of next year. These opportunistic buybacks are a critically important tool for us to compound per share growth for investors over time. And to round out my prepared remarks this morning, I'd like to give a brief update on our investment-grade financial position. We exited the quarter with $3.5 billion of liquidity and a low net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.7x. This leverage resides well below our mid-cycle leverage target of 1x or less. Subsequent to quarter end, we took the next step in improving our financial position by retiring $242 million of debt at maturity. With a strong cash flow our business is generating, we'll have additional opportunities to pare down our debt and maturities coming due in 2024 and 2025 as well. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.Richard E. MuncriefThank you, Jeff. Good job. I would like to close out today by reiterating 4 key messages from our prepared remarks. Number one, our disciplined execution in the second quarter demonstrates our business is performing at a high level and building momentum as we head into the second half of the year. Number two, this positive trajectory is underpinned by better capital efficiency from higher and faster cycle times, strong well productivity and improving service costs that will contribute to our financial results over the remainder of this year and into 2024. Number three, our resource base continued to strengthen this quarter. This was evidenced by our highly commercial appraisal results in the deeper Wolfcamp and a positive redevelopment test in the Eagle Ford that adds to our conviction of resource upside across our portfolio. And number four, with this advantaged resource base, we are deeply committed to a disciplined pursuit of per share value creation over production volume growth. Foundational to this commitment is our carefully designed cash turn framework that has the flexibility to allocate free cash flow across multiple avenues to optimize shareholder value through the cycle. And now with that, I'll turn the call back over to Scott as we get into Q&amp;A.Scott CoodyThanks, Rick. We'll now open the call to Q&amp;A. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. This allows us to get to more of your questions on the call today. With that, operator, we'll take our first question.Question and Answer SessionOperatorWe have our first question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.Neil Singhvi MehtaThe first question is just on the production profile for the back half of the year. As you indicated, you guys are focused on value over volume. But some of the pushback we've done this morning has been centered around volumes being a little bit below consensus for the back half of the year. So maybe your thoughts on whether there's some conservatism in the way that you model this out and where are areas potentially that could surprise the upside?Clay M. GasparNeil, thanks for the question. This is Clay. I just want to reiterate, we feel good about our full year guide certainly, with the accelerated activity, things moving a little quicker on the D&amp;C front, that pulled a little bit of our production forward. That's great on a per well basis, but you get a little bit of lumpiness in the productivity. So we get -- we pulled some of that third quarter volume forward. So we maintain our full year guide, but we've always seen kind of a role as we pull back from that 4 frac fleet in the Delaware to the third. So nothing new, nothing unplanned, but consistent with what we've been showing and once again, feel real good about the full year guide.Neil Singhvi MehtaAll right. That's great. And then the follow-up is just, can you talk a little bit about this water handling contracts in the Delaware. There's a modest bump up in the LOE in the guide, so a little bit of background on what it is, and how we should think about it?Jeffrey L. RitenourYes, Neil, this is Jeff. Happy to do that. Yes, we're excited about the flexibility and the scale that, that's going to bring to our water handling in the basin we're going to have multiple disposal options as opposed to what we had before. It does bring a little higher operating cost at the asset level. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, with the equity stake that we've got in the joint venture, we'll be receiving distributions on a go-forward basis, which is going to more than offset that additional LOE costs that we're going to see. So -- and as I also mentioned in the prepared remarks, we also think it provides us a great opportunity with that equity position to monetize the asset at some point in the future. So really excited about the flexibility it gives to us operationally. As Clay will attest, there's certainly a fair amount of water we got to move out in the Delaware Basin. So this additional flexibility and scale, we think, is going to be a real positive for us. I'll also add, it certainly helps us on the capital efficiency front because it helps us to eliminate a pretty material amount of capital that we otherwise would have had to spend on water infrastructure as you look out over the next couple of years.OperatorWe have our next question comes from Nitin Kumar from Mizuho.Nitin KumarRick, you've kind of mentioned a little bit of an acceleration of activity into the first half. It's a little bit different than what you had said when you gave the guidance for the year, it does imply a little bit slower cadence of completions in the second half of 2023. And I'm just wondering, could we use that as a baseline for 2024 in terms of activity levels?Richard E. MuncriefNitin, I'll tell you what we like to do is we think most important thing for us is we like the consistency. As you think about quarter-over-quarter, we've been pretty consistent for a while on our production. And we like to look at things on an annual basis. Clay mentioned the fact that you do have some lumpiness from time to time just through acceleration. You could have working interest changes, you could have some assessment work, you do all sorts of things like that. But I think for us, the most important thing, Nitin, would be that let's just look year-over-year, and I know that we -- people like to look at things on a quarterly basis. But from my perspective, I want to watch say year-over-year profile, and let's lean in on share repurchases and let's make sure that we get that growth on a per share basis. And Clay, is there anything else you want to add to that?Clay M. GasparYes, Rick, in your question was, should we expect that run rate. Just remember that fourth frac crew in the front half of the year we are consuming DUCs essentially in that period. Just if you look at Delaware Basin, and then when we're running 3 frac crews as we will in the second half of the year, we're essentially generating DUCs. And in a fully optimized world, we would pick up and drop that fourth spot crew to optimize. I would say in today's world, what we're doing is really trying to bring that crew in, get them fully up to speed, let them run through the opportunities that we have. And then put them on pause in this case, for about 6 months, we'll pick them back up again in January. You'll see capital tick up, but you'll certainly see the production tick up as well related to that crew. So that does exacerbate the lumpiness that we talk about. I'd love to have a straight line. But again, when you pan out and look at an annual basis like Rick talked about, you really see the consistency of our program.Nitin KumarI guess for my follow-up, we've seen some private assets change hands here in the last 3 months or so. The shape of the Delaware Basin is -- has changed a little bit. You've previously talked about scale and the importance of that to the new business model that Devon initiated 3 years ago. So just any thoughts on the M&amp;A market going forward? Do you see room for consolidation here? And what is the role that you think you might play?Richard E. MuncriefNitin, that's a great question. I think we've talked about this fairly consistently. As far as consolidation, I think; a, it's going to continue to happen. I think as you start looking across many companies' portfolios, and we're not one of those companies, but there's a lot of companies out there, many of the smaller companies they're going to start looking for options because they are getting light on inventory. Some of the private consolidations that we've seen recently that you're referring to -- many of those were companies that exhibited performance. It was really -- quite honestly, it was pretty impressive in how fast they grew their production, how fast they were going through that inventory, but they also see the challenge of where they're going to go in the future. And for companies like us, we're going to be very, very disciplined, and we just haven't had an appetite to really take on that steep decline rate that you would be inheriting. You have to be very, very thoughtful and it gets to be tricky. Now I will say there were some pretty creative solutions with some of those companies that had those and bringing some 2 and 3 companies altogether to make some pretty interesting transaction. But I think it just represents the creativity in our sector. I think you're going to continue to see consolidation. I think it makes a ton of sense, and it's going to happen for numerous reasons. And over time, you'll continue to see companies consolidate, and there'll be companies such as Devon, I believe, that will be the beneficiaries of those because we're going to be very disciplined, and I think we'll try to be opportunistic and make sure that we make moves that just build a stronger and stronger, more durable company. And so -- but you're spot on. I think consolidation in our industry is going to continue.OperatorWe have our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup.Scott Andrew GruberCurious about the returns you're seeing on the refrac wells in the Eagle Ford. How do those compare to a new well in the basin, and how does that influence, how you prosecute that program going forward?Clay M. GasparYes. Thanks for the question, Scott. This is Clay. We're really excited about the work that we've seen to date. We have about 30 tests we're still learning on what's the right wells to go in and refrac what's the right techniques to go in and prosecute those. And so I would say for only being 30 wells in 30 refracs in we're very encouraged about the results. We're encouraged about the inventory that we had. I should note, in the Validus acquisition we did, we had 0 refracs underwritten in the acquisition price. And now we're seeing more material upside, both in redevelopment and in refracs. I would say on a heads-up basis, when you think about returns, the better ones certainly compete heads up with the wells that we're drilling today. But you really have to really think about how do you prosecute those, the right approach, and you end up getting a variety of them. So I would say it's too early to tell on an exact quantity and the overall return, but certainly, the top half of what we've derisked today, we feel really good about and will certainly become more of a regular part of our investment opportunities on an annual basis.Scott Andrew GruberAnd just an unrelated follow-up, but I did notice that the gas [feed] on the quarter at least versus our numbers, was largely driven by the Anadarko and by the Williston. Was anything going on in those basins that led to a gas production step up. Are you seeing the gas oil ratio of the base there step higher? Just some color on the gas production in Anadarko and Williston be great.Clay M. GasparYes. Thanks for that. The Anadarko Basin certainly is our gassier option. We have a lot of running room right now. We're more focused on the liquids-rich portion of it. But even relative to the rest of our portfolio, that's certainly a gassier part of the mix. When we look to the wells that we're developing in Williston, a little bit higher gas cut there as well. Very importantly, we've done a good job of getting that gas down the line, through the meter and sold rather than flaring. Happy to report our flaring numbers continue to be heading in the right direction around the company, especially in Williston. And that's certainly not without challenges. I think that's the bigger contributors to the increase in gas, getting that through the meter, getting that sold is always a very high objective, but we're also really focused on the oil side of the equation, which is where our revenues really come from.OperatorWe have our next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.Arun JayaramI know you guys aren't yet ready to provide more specific [called] soft commentary on 2024, but I did want to get maybe some of your early read on 2024 CapEx. If we look at your second half '23 CapEx guidance, it's around $1.7 billion or $850 million a quarter. If we annualize that, that would be about $3.4 billion. It sounds like you would need a, call it, a partial fourth frac crew to execute your 2024 plan. So I just wanted to say if those are kind of the elements should we be thinking about CapEx in the mid, call it, $3.5 billion kind of range. But again, just wanted to get some preliminary thoughts.Clay M. GasparYes. I appreciate that, Arun. I think your logic on how to get there as far as rig count, frac fleet count, I completely agree with. I'm going to hold back on giving you a number for next year. There's a lot of things going on around what's happening in commodity price, therefore, rig count, therefore, inflation, deflation, those things have pretty material impacts, and we're just going to hold back. But I think directionally, think of the same similar activity as a really good starting point.Arun JayaramGreat. And my follow-up maybe for Jeff. Jeff, I wanted to kind of zero in on the Williston Basin. This is called the third quarter in a row that we've seen relatively low realizations for natural gas and NGLs. So I was just wondering if you could provide what's going on there? And is this going to be a persistent impact to you going forward?Jeffrey L. RitenourYes, Arun, this is Jeff. Yes, I appreciate the question. As Clay mentioned earlier, there, particularly in the Williston, where you've got some gas is obviously not the lion's share of the production mix. But can be a real challenge, obviously, to move the gas up there given the infrastructure and the constraints that we have. I would tell you, when you look at those realizations in particular in the -- excuse me, in the Williston, you're going to see some wild volatility just given the deducts that we have from a realization standpoint. And so it's not a -- it's not going to be as clean and consistent as you would usually see in some of our other basins. I'd also point out, as you're well aware, it's pretty immaterial in the grand scheme of things, given the margins that we see from the oil barrels there.OperatorWe have our next question comes from Neal Dingmann from Truist.Neal David DingmannMy first question, guys, is on your Delaware Basin specifically. Maybe, Clay, could you speak to what benefits that recent Wolfcamp B appraisal success might have on -- I mean maybe it's too early to say what it might have on total production. But maybe what you think the upside of that could drive in the, I don't know, later this year or next year? And then just wondering how you view also the benefits. You've touched on this earlier in your comments. How you view the benefits of bringing some of those wells forward this year, not the appraisals of course, but the others.Clay M. GasparYes, Neal, first question around the B. I mean, this is so important and fundamental to what we do around the assessment work. We talked about on several calls, this 10% to 20% of the dollars that aren't directed towards the most near-term capital efficient, but it's so important that we dig deeper out into the portfolio to derisk these opportunities. And when we see after several reps of really understanding what that opportunity is, and they certainly jump up to the front of the line compete even with some of the best stuff we're investing in today, it's pretty exciting. And so it's something we just want to share specifically in Cotton Draw, specifically in these B zones. These are really accretive and very valuable. Now full disclosure, they're already baked into the inventory numbers that we guide to, but they're baked in on a risk standpoint. So as we derisk them, net-net to us, there's real value creation and being able to prosecute on those. The second question was around moving the opportunities forward. So that's just -- we have 16 rigs running. They're all running just a little bit ahead of pace. The completion crews, same deal there, 4 frac crews for the front half of the year in the Delaware Basin, they're just running just a little bit ahead of pace. And so that fourth crew that we toggle on and off originally was slated to run through October. And then we pull it back to September than August. We finally were able to release that in July and accomplish everything that we needed to accomplish. So you can imagine the well cost savings and the value creation on a per well basis. Now it kind of monkeys with our quarterly numbers a little bit, as you can see. But overall, we're always trying to pull that value forward. We're thinking about per well full cycle cost, how do we continue to drive that? And then how does it manifest to the bottom line of the company.Neal David DingmannThat makes sense. And maybe the last one for Jeff, just on capital allocation, just how aggressively Jeff, do you all think about going forward, do you all plan to target net debt while combining this with your strong shareholder return program.Jeffrey L. RitenourYes, I appreciate the question. I think going forward, you're going to see our -- as our framework has been pretty consistent from day 1, as Rick mentioned in his in his opening remarks, you shouldn't expect a material change in that approach. We're going to be pretty balanced. As you saw this year-to-date, between the variable dividend and the stock buyback, it's been about 50-50, which, to me, is a great example of how well our framework is working last year when we had much higher prices and significant free cash flow generation. We leaned in on the variable dividends. And this year, when you've seen that pull back, you've seen much more balance from us with the stock buybacks as well. Going forward, where we are from a cash balance and a framework standpoint, as we generate excess free cash flow here in the back half of the year given the lower capital spend we expect and the higher oil prices that we're projecting in the back half of this year, we should generate significant free cash flow, we're going to look to build our cash balance back. And then with the remainder of the cash, we're going to focus on, obviously, the variable and the stock buybacks on an opportunistic basis.OperatorWe have our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.Douglas George Blyth LeggateI have 2 if you don't mind. One is on mix, and one is on portfolio capital intensity. And I guess it's that we've seen this trend obviously across a number of your peers. But if you look at the oil mix in your production. It's obviously been up and down a little bit over the last couple of years, but it seems to have dropped now below 50%. I'm just wondering when you think about how you're allocating capital between your different operating areas, particularly, I guess, Anadarko versus Permian. How do you anticipate as you optimize your spend that, that oil mix is going to trend? I've got a follow-up, please.Jeffrey L. RitenourYes, Doug, this is Jeff. I would say we view that the mix of the oil to be pretty consistent on a year-over-year basis. We're really focused on rate of return and the returns that we generate in our play. We're agnostic, frankly, to oil or gas. But as we all know, certainly, oil is the higher-margin product today, and our focus has been, particularly in the Delaware. So with the Dow JV that we have in the Anadarko Basin, that obviously reduces those returns and helps from a capital efficiency standpoint and makes that activity pretty competitive with our broader portfolio. But we -- I think we would all tell you, and it's not going to be a surprise to anybody on the call that the Delaware without doubt is our most capital-efficient asset today, it's oil-weighted. That's where the bulk of our margins come from. And as we move forward into 2024 and beyond, we would expect it to capture the lion's share of our capital investment.Douglas George Blyth LeggateOkay. I guess, we'll take another look at that. But my follow-up, Jeff, is, look, I realize that inflation and cost and everything else is a well-trodden path. Everyone understands what's going on there, what has gone on there. But I want to share an observation with you just to get your opinion on this and see what you think. When I look at your peers, obviously, one of your large peers reported this morning that the capital intensity simplistically on a per BOE basis is up about 30%. Your's is up about 80%. For example, if I take your spend in the first half of last year, it was about $10 a BOE. First half of this year, it's about $17 a BOE and production is obviously up small. So I'm just wondering if you can address that and tell us what you think is going on? Is there capital in there that is transitory, for example, in the infrastructure you talked about, or what else should we be looking at to try and understand what's changed there?Jeffrey L. RitenourYes, Doug, I would say, as you know, it's a mix of things. Without a doubt, one of the things that we've talked about a lot is the inflation that hit us and the certainly started in the back half of last year and worked its way into this year. That's a big driver of that. The timing of our contracts and the roll-off of our contract structure as it relates to all of the different cost categories, I think has also disproportionately hit us relative to our peers. Said another way, I thought our teams did a great job of protecting us from the inflation in the very early part of the cycle. So think about the fall of last year and the early part of this year. And now as we worked our way through 2023, alot of those contracts have rolled off into a higher price environment from an inflation standpoint. And so you've seen some of the capital efficiency for our asset base relative to some others certainly change. Obviously, mix is a big driver of that. The shift that we made with the acquisitions in Validus and Rimrock, you're moving away from a more capital-efficient asset in the Delaware from a mix standpoint to really great assets, really great returns in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford. But as I mentioned in my response to the previous question, they're certainly not as capital efficient as what we see in the Delaware. So you put all that together, and I think that's what you're seeing really driving that capital efficiency rate of change relative to some of our peers. I will say, though, when you step back and you look at that capital efficiency on an absolute basis, company versus company, we feel really good about where we sit, and we look really, really competitive against the top-tier companies in the space. That rate of change, as you point out, has just been pretty material and have been a challenge on a relative basis as you all screen for capital efficiency. But when we look at the capital efficiency on an absolute basis, we still feel really good about where we sit. And we expect that to improve as we work our way into the future for all the reasons you mentioned earlier, which is we do expect to see some deflation as we work our way through the back half of this year into next year. And as Clay mentioned earlier, the mix of our asset base and the things we're focused on, we think that only is going to add to our productivity moving forward.OperatorOur next question comes from Matthew Portillo from TPH.Matthew Merrel PortilloClay, maybe a question for you to start off on the Bakken. I know that's an asset that has faced some technical challenges to start the year. Could you impact some of the headwinds a bit more that you faced in the first half and maybe a little bit more around the completion design change that you guys have made that may start to show some improvement in the well results in the back half and heading into 2024?Clay M. GasparHappy to do it, Matt. Thanks for the question. As I think about the Williston, it is certainly maybe the most mature of all the oil resource plays. We're learning things for the first time what these late innings really look like. Certainly, with the Rimrock acquisition, bringing those wells in, we faced some challenges really from a subsurface standpoint, but also some from a relatively surface standpoint, and I'll talk about both. From a subsurface standpoint, one of the challenges we faced, specifically with some of the wells we acquired is the nature of the depletion these crosscut wells are really unique. And so we've seen wells that we've drilled through essentially have a depletion and then essentially [verger] pressure and then back to depletion throughout the lateral. Producing those -- completing those and producing those have been a relatively unique challenge. We haven't seen anywhere else. We've gotten some solution I've talked about earlier. I think we're doing really well on getting those wells producing consistently getting them unloaded and allowing the proppant to stay in place, which is fundamentally important to be able to producing the wells. More on the surface side, once you get that proppant in place, then you don't have the challenges of artificial lift. You don't have the sand flowing back to surface and adding additional complications. What we really faced in the first quarter was some of these operational challenges and then still in a very tight workover rig environment, reaching for that workover rig, having to stand in line or the opportunity cost of pulling it off of something else we were trying to do has been pretty uniquely challenging. I think we've gotten a good recipe for the wells going forward. A lot of our inventory that we're able to go back to now will not have some of these same challenges. It's more run of the mill, what we've been dealing with in Williston for the last several years and really delivering some really good well results. So yes, the first quarter was challenging from an operational standpoint, especially in the first quarter, compounded by weather. I feel good about the direction we're headed, the response we've had from the team, and the outlook going forward.Matthew Merrel PortilloPerfect. And then just as a follow-up, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned seeing quite a bit of success in the Anadarko Basin and the potential for a further expansion of the partnership. Just curious, is that something that you may pursue with Dow, or are you looking at bringing in potentially other partners to continue to progress the asset from a development standpoint?Clay M. GasparWe love -- we cherish our partnerships, and we love it when it's a mutual win-win. Dow has been very pleased with this partnership. We have as well. It's allowed the Anadarko Basin to compete in our pretty rigorous portfolio and so expanding that, certainly, Dow has a very good knowledge of the basin, it would be the easiest to pursue with them. Certainly, look, we're objective. We have other partnerships around the company, but it's something we're regularly talking about with Dow, how will this work for them, how would this work for us? We haven't made any decisions on that, but just thought I would mention, we have an additional runway beyond the current scope that we may end up pursuing at some point.OperatorWith our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC.Scott Michael HanoldI'm just wondering if you've had some thoughts on just the overall maturation and depth of your inventory. It appears with you all that there's a little bit more exploration and refrac and other kind of opportunity. Does that point to the maturity of some of the assets? And is there a little reason more to do more kind of exploration and development of that sort? Or just give us a sense of like when you think about like primary drilling of economics you have today, like how much of a runway do you have?Richard E. MuncriefScott, it's Rick. We feel really good about our runway, but we also are compelled to continue to explore, to continue to assess what we already own. You've heard some several comments, commentary around consolidation opportunities. I think it's incumbent upon this management team to first, let's understand what the opportunities we already have in hand. You've heard Clay talk about how we had -- in the Wolfcamp B, we feel really, really good about some resource potential there. We added in a risk basis, and you go out and you execute on those and you find out that they really are good. And the implication is that not only the offsets of where we're at, but when you think about a 400,000-acre position that we possess in the Delaware, and you can continue to do these and these assessment activities. And quite honestly, you either meet or exceed what your expectations are. That's a good thing. That's better than good. That's a great thing because that adds to your risk or your own risk -- excuse me, your risked inventory that you feel really good. When I say that, that's inventory you're pulling off the shelf and executing on and with phenomenal returns. And so whether it's in the Delaware, whether it's these opportunities that we have in the Eagle Ford, which we're really bullish on, which is the opportunities we see in the Bakken, which we continue to see some nice opportunities there. We feel really good about it. But I think it's incumbent upon this team to continue to assess what our current acreage position is as we compare and contrast executing on that, holding what we have versus going out and buying more consolidating more. So just -- it's real fundamental to our business.Scott Michael HanoldYes. I mean -- and that's good to hear. And I think the question is a lot on sort of the capital efficiency trend as you move from a very high core prolific Delaware Basin to some of these other zones or even to some of these other players like the Anadarko and Eagle Ford and Williston or PRB, right? So it's more about that capital efficiency trend relative to kind of the best stuff you've already drilled?Richard E. MuncriefRight. I think that's what you're going to see. I think you're seeing maturation in a lot of these basins. And if you just think about whether it's -- you've seen it in the Midland Basin, we're not in the Midland Basin, but you've seen that for several years where every year until you start bringing new resource on, you're going to be continuing to evolve and people will tend to go to their highest returns. What -- you've seen it in the Bakken. We've seen it in the Eagle Ford. But I can tell you there's many of these basins, we're excited about the potential that we see with restimulation and some tighter spacing in some cases, we up space in the other areas. We just learned more about the resources we have. But that's been the history of our business over the last 100 years is plays and basins will mature over time until there is either a change in technology, new intervals are found. And so I think you're just -- you're seeing that play out in real time. We're continuing to -- but we're excited about what we're seeing. So hopefully, that's coming across in our -- not only prepared remarks, but some of our answers that whether it's restimulation down in the Eagle Ford, whether it's what we're seeing the assessment work in the Delaware and other place Powder, Anadarko, we're just really excited about what we have.Scott Michael HanoldOkay. I appreciate the added color. And just one quickly on the fixed dividend. You spend a little bit time, Jeff, on buybacks and variables. But remind us of your thoughts on the fixed dividend, what -- where you want that to be? I think it's about 1.5% or something to that effect. Do you feel good about that? Or would you like to see it stronger relative to the S&amp;P or to some of your, obviously, E&amp;P peers?Jeffrey L. RitenourYes. No, absolutely. I'm glad you asked the question. We're absolutely focused on growing the fixed dividend as we work into the future. And so you should expect us on a year-over-year basis to lean in and grow the fixed dividend as we get more and more confident, obviously, in our base game plan and our framework. It's -- yes, I certainly should have mentioned it earlier. It's the priority one as it relates to our cash return framework, and it only falls behind, obviously, the financial strength and the balance sheet. So absolutely expect to see us grow that into the future.OperatorWe have our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.Paul ChengTwo questions, please. First, I think, Clay, you mentioned that Bakken is the most mature, which certainly is the case. And you talk about the refrac and the development opportunity in Eagle Ford can you talk about within your portfolio, have you already looked at what is the refrac and development opportunity in Bakken and how long do you think you may be able to hold the current production spread. The same question, going back into the Eagle Ford. I know it's still early, but for refrac and the development, what kind of WTI and Henry Hub gas price minimum you need in order for those to work.Clay M. GasparYes. So I'll tackle those. Starting with the Williston. It's a very different reservoir rock than the Eagle Ford. The Eagle Ford is very notoriously tight, low permeability, which is a challenge in trying to initially develop. What we're finding is there's some benefits in redevelopment being able to space in wells later in life and not having some of the challenges that we see in other basins. We're not going to be able to do that same kind of model in many other basins because it's fairly unique to the Eagle Ford. When it comes to refracs, it's a little bit different scenario. Williston being on the more mature and also having a fair amount of the development early in the industry's understanding of how best to complete these wells. There's some really inferior completions, and so the opportunity there is a little bit different. It's not from a reservoir standpoint, it's more from a completion standpoint, how do we go in and restimulate some of these wells that were massively understimulated. So therein lies a different opportunity there. The Eagle Ford, you asked about kind of breakeven cost for the refracs, I don't have a very good number for that. I would say, in the top half of the opportunities that we're looking at, many of those are very competitive with what we're drilling today, which is pretty -- a very, very solid return. So I would put it in that bucket. There's still a lot of work to do on refining how do we figure out where is the line and certainly commodity price will play a role in how many of these refracs and potentially even trifracs, you come back again at a later date. Those opportunities will certainly be commodity price dependent.Richard E. MuncriefPaul, it's Rick. I'd just say that when I think about those restem opportunities down the Eagle Ford. In my mind, in a $50 world, as long as you're north of $50 and a $3 Henry Hub, you're going to have some pretty good returns. We're pleased with that. One of the things I'll add, the previous question we had was around some of the assessment work, just -- everybody needs to recall, we're only doing a small percentage of our capital budget with assessment work. It's not like we're really leaning in on that. We do think it's important to allocate a certain amount of capital and really excited about what the -- what it holds for us. That being said, I know at a time when people are hyper focused on capital efficiency, that's fair. It really is. But we also need to think about the future, and when I say the future, it's not next quarter. It's the next 5, 10, 15, 20 years.Scott CoodyAll right. It looks like we're at the top of the hour. I appreciate everyone's interest in Devon today. And if you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team at any time. Have a good day, everyone.OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

419,e48b72b5-7e57-3a65-8802-eb9390f70b29,URI,2023-08-03,United Rentals (NYSE:URI) Could Be A Buy For Its Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-rentals-nyse-uri-could-100838363.html,1691057318,STORY,['URI'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Thus, you can purchase United Rentals' shares before the 8th of August in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 23rd of August.The upcoming dividend for United Rentals is US$1.48 per share. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether United Rentals's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for United Rentals Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. United Rentals has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 9.0% of its income after tax. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. The good news is it paid out just 13% of its free cash flow in the last year.It's positive to see that United Rentals's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. For this reason, we're glad to see United Rentals's earnings per share have risen 16% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share are growing rapidly and the company is keeping more than half of its earnings within the business; an attractive combination which could suggest the company is focused on reinvesting to grow earnings further. This will make it easier to fund future growth efforts and we think this is an attractive combination - plus the dividend can always be increased later.Story continuesThis is United Rentals's first year of paying a dividend, which is exciting for shareholders - but it does mean there's no dividend history to examine.Final TakeawayIs United Rentals worth buying for its dividend? We love that United Rentals is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.In light of that, while United Rentals has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for United Rentals you should be aware of.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

This article will cover recent employment and labor market trends and look at highly rewarding companies that recruit fresh graduates. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, go directly to the 5 Countries with the Highest Starting Salaries for Graduates.The Global Labor Market: An OverviewThe COVID-19 pandemic not only brought distress to the physical health of the global population, but it left the world with a financial burden to recover from. Labor shortages, rising global inflation rates and unemployment rates, productivity constraints, and declining quality of work are some of the pandemic-induced crises. The International Labor Organization suggests that the global employment rate will only increase by 1% in 2023. The report further states that young adults and fresh graduates are increasingly finding it difficult to settle for a job. Over 1 of every 5 young adults are neither employed nor in education.Experts also raise eyebrows about the declining productivity and quality of work. According to the World Economic Forum, as of 2022, three in ten manufacturing and service companies in Europe reported declining productivity. The United States reported 70% of the job openings as unfilled in retail and wholesale, 55% in manufacturing, and 45% in the leisure and hospitality industry. While COVID-19 shook global economic roots, the pandemic fueled the otherwise steadily growing technology industry. Big data analytics and artificial intelligence have been one of the fastest-growing industries globally.According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global big data analytics industry was valued at $271.83 billion in 2022. The global big data analytics industry is expected to reach a valuation of $745.15 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.5%. The big data analytics industry is dominated by North American companies, followed by countries in the Asia Pacific notably China, India, South Korea, Singapore, and Japan. Major players in the industry are International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Story continuesAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the Global artificial intelligence (AI) industry was valued at $428 billion in 2022. The Global Artificial Intelligence (AI) industry is expected to grow to a valuation of $2.025 trillion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.6%.  As of November 2022, ChatGPT, the popular AI software gained over a million users in just five days after its official launch. Moreover, as of February 2023, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company, launched its official AI chatbot. Additionally, big data giants like International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) acquired Dialexa, a product engineering services firm, in September 2022. The acquiring company, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM),  intended to integrate the use of technology to automate operations and enhance customer service. Such showcases the need to integrate technology and automate business solutions to compete globally.Artificial intelligence is used mostly within retail, IT, telecom, healthcare, advertising and media, manufacturing, and the automotive industry. North America dominates the artificial intelligence industry. As per the report, almost 80% of businesses based in the United States were optimistic and enthusiastic about the integration of AI in their businesses.While North America dominated the market share of the global AI industry in 2022, the Asia Pacific region is forecasted to grow at the fastest rate over the coming years, followed by emerging markets including Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.Is AI Expected to Take Over the Labor Market?According to the World Economic Forum, 75% of companies are leaping through technological advancements. Big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence are notable technologies altering the economic landscape by enabling digital trade and e-commerce. Within the next five years, 86% of companies worldwide are expected to integrate digital platforms and apps into their business operations. Additionally, 74.9% of companies are expected to adapt to artificial intelligence by 2027. The incidence of artificial intelligence alters the labor market landscape entirely. Artificial intelligence is changing how jobs are being done, and how people create content for their businesses and sell their commodities. According to the World Economic Forum report we cited above, thanks to generative AI, 19% of the workforce could have 50% of their workload automated. Moreover, 34% of human tasks in organizations are already being performed by machines or robots. One can argue that the existence of AI may cost millions of people their jobs and household income. However, the key takeaway with AI being able to perform tasks could be the ability to set up businesses from the comfort of your homes without having to employ an army of workers. The real question stands, is AI stealing jobs or is it changing the economic landscape of the world for good?Notable Companies Popular Amongst GraduatesLanding a well-paying job as a fresh graduate is a daunting experience.

This compares to FFO of $3.99 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 1.90%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this self-storage facility real estate investment trust would post FFO of $4.07 per share when it actually produced FFO of $4.08, delivering a surprise of 0.25%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates four times.Public Storage , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $1.12 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.16%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.03 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Public Storage shares have lost about 0.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.2%.What's Next for Public Storage?While Public Storage has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Public Storage: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $4.24 on $1.14 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $16.78 on $4.5 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Service Properties (SVC), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023.

These factors led to an increase in our outlook for the back half of the year,"" said Joe Russell, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""We continue to invest in the industry’s leading digital platform and our operating model, while enhancing and growing our portfolio. As evidenced by our recent $2.2 billion Simply Self Storage acquisition, we remain uniquely positioned to deliver growth and value to our stakeholders.""Highlights for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023Reported net income allocable to common shareholders of $3.00 per diluted share.Reported core FFO allocable to common shareholders (""Core FFO"") of $4.28 per diluted share, an increase of 7.3% relative to the same period in 2022. Core FFO per diluted share increased 11.5% compared to the same period in 2022, excluding the contribution from our equity investment in PS Business Parks, Inc., which we sold in July 2022.Increased Same Store (as defined below) direct net operating income by 6.2%, resulting from a 6.3% increase in Same Store revenues.Achieved 80.3% Same Store direct net operating income margin.Acquired eleven self-storage facilities with 0.9 million net rentable square feet for $144.0 million. Subsequent to June 30, 2023, we acquired or were under contract to acquire eleven self-storage facilities with 0.8 million net rentable square feet, for $118.2 million. In addition, on July 24, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement with Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (""BREIT"") to acquire BREIT Simply Storage LLC, a self-storage company that owns and operates 127 self-storage facilities (9.4 million square feet) and manages 25 self-storage facilities (1.8 million square feet) for third parties, for a cash acquisition price of $2.2 billion (the ""Simply Acquisition"").Story continuesCompleted various expansion projects with 0.2 million net rentable square feet costing $19.1 million. At June 30, 2023, we had various facilities in development and expansion with 4.8 million net rentable square feet estimated to cost $1.0 billion.On July 24, 2023, in connection with the Simply Acquisition, issued $2.2 billion of unsecured senior notes in 2-, 5.5-, 10-, and 30-year tranches bearing annual rates of Compounded SOFR + 0.60%, 5.125%, 5.100%, and 5.350%, respectively.Operating Results for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023For the three months ended June 30, 2023, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $528.3 million or $3.00 per diluted common share, compared to $603.4 million or $3.42 per diluted common share for the same period in 2022, representing a decrease of $75.1 million or $0.42 per diluted common share. The decrease is due primarily to (i) a $102.8 million decrease in foreign currency exchange gains primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable and (ii) a $39.0 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities due to the sale of our equity investment in PSB in July 2022, partially offset by (iii) a $63.1 million increase in self-storage net operating income.The $63.1 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 is a result of a $41.4 million increase attributable to our Same Store Facilities and a $21.7 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities (as defined below). Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 6.3% or $51.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot, partially offset by a decline in occupancy. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 5.2% or $9.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, due primarily to increased property tax expense and marketing expense. The increase in net operating income of $21.7 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and 2022 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Operating Results for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023For the six months ended June 30, 2023, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $995.8 million or $5.65 per diluted common share, compared to $1,067.5 million or $6.05 per diluted common share for the same period in 2022, representing a decrease of $71.7 million or $0.40 per diluted common share. The decrease is due primarily to (i) a $165.1 million decrease in foreign currency exchange gains primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable and (ii) a $76.4 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities due to our sale of PSB in July 2022, partially offset by (iii) a $155.2 million increase in self-storage net operating income and (iv) a $23.4 million increase in interest and other income.The $155.2 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 is a result of a $105.7 million increase attributable to our Same Store Facilities and a $49.5 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 8.0% or $126.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot, partially offset by a decline in occupancy. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 5.4% or $20.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, due primarily to increased property tax expense, repairs and maintenance expenses, marketing expense, and other direct property costs. The increase in net operating income of $49.5 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and 2022 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Funds from OperationsFunds from Operations (""FFO"") and FFO per share are non-GAAP measures defined by Nareit. We believe that FFO and FFO per share are useful to REIT investors and analysts in measuring our performance because Nareit’s definition of FFO excludes items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating and financial performance. FFO represents net income before depreciation and amortization, which is excluded because it is based upon historical costs and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FFO also excludes gains or losses on sale of real estate assets and real estate impairment charges, which are also based upon historical costs and are impacted by historical depreciation. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes investing and financing activities presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful.For the three months ended June 30, 2023, FFO was $4.29 per diluted common share as compared to $4.58 for the same period in 2022, representing a decrease of 6.3%.For the six months ended June 30, 2023, FFO was $8.24 per diluted common share, as compared to $8.41 in the same period in 2022, representing a decrease of 2.0%.We also present ""Core FFO"" and ""Core FFO per share,"" non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities, and (iii) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items primarily representing, with respect to the periods presented below, the impact of contingency resolution, due diligence costs incurred in pursuit of strategic transactions, unrealized gain on private equity investments, and our equity share of deferred tax benefits of a change in tax status and severance of a senior executive from our equity investees. We review Core FFO and Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance, and we believe they are used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However, Core FFO and Core FFO per share are not substitutes for net income and net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO or Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology, or may not present such measures, Core FFO and Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.The following table reconciles net income to FFO and Core FFO and reconciles diluted earnings per share to FFO per share and Core FFO per share (unaudited):Three Months Ended June 30,Six Months Ended June 30,20232022PercentageChange20232022PercentageChange(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)Reconciliation of Net Income to FFO and Core FFO:Net income allocable to common shareholders$528,259$603,381(12.5)%$995,847$1,067,505(6.7)%Eliminate items excluded from FFO:Depreciation and amortization220,971217,373440,758438,168Depreciation from unconsolidated real estate investments9,15517,56617,68434,386Depreciation allocated to noncontrolling interests and restricted share unitholders(1,732)(1,533)(3,205)(3,190)Gains on sale of real estate investments, including our equity share from investments(72)(29,306)(72)(53,184)FFO allocable to common shares$756,581$807,481(6.3)%$1,451,012$1,483,685(2.2)%Eliminate the impact of items excluded from Core FFO, including our equity share from investments:Foreign currency exchange loss (gain)1,096(101,723)27,956(137,100)Other items(4,093)(1,781)(6,226)766Core FFO allocable to common shares$753,584$703,9777.0%$1,472,742$1,347,3519.3%Reconciliation of Diluted Earnings per Share to FFO per Share and Core FFO per Share:Diluted earnings per share$3.00$3.42(12.3)%$5.65$6.05(6.6)%Eliminate amounts per share excluded from FFO:Depreciation and amortization1.291.322.592.66Gains on sale of real estate investments, including our equity share from investments—(0.16)—(0.30)FFO per share$4.29$4.58(6.3)%$8.24$8.41(2.0)%Eliminate the per share impact of items excluded from Core FFO, including our equity share from investments:Foreign currency exchange loss (gain)0.01(0.58)0.16(0.78)Other items(0.02)(0.01)(0.04)0.01Core FFO per share$4.28$3.997.3%$8.36$7.649.4%Exclude the contribution from our equity investment in PS Business Parks, Inc. to Core FFO per share—(0.15)—(0.30)Core FFO per share, excluding the impact of PS Business Parks, Inc.$4.28$3.8411.5%$8.36$7.3413.9%Diluted weighted average common shares176,212176,312176,181176,325Property Operations – Same Store FacilitiesThe Same Store Facilities consist of facilities that have been owned and operated on a stabilized level of occupancy, revenues, and cost of operations since January 1, 2021. The composition of our Same Store Facilities allows us to more effectively evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2021, 2022, and 2023 and exclude the impact of fill-up of unstabilized facilities, which can significantly affect operating trends. We believe the Same Store information is used by investors and analysts in a similar manner. However, because other REITs may not compute Same Store Facilities in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology, or may not present such a measure, Same Store Facilities may not be comparable among REITs. The following table summarizes the historical operating results (for all periods presented) of these 2,344 facilities (155.2 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 75% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at June 30, 2023 (unaudited):Three Months Ended June 30,Six Months Ended June 30,20232022Change20232022Change(Dollar amounts in thousands, except for per square foot data)Revenues (a):Rental income$836,124$788,6846.0%$1,655,058$1,535,8177.8%Late charges and administrative fees28,38124,73814.7%56,61549,39314.6%Total revenues864,505813,4226.3%1,711,6731,585,2108.0%Direct cost of operations (a):Property taxes77,21174,5043.6%153,895147,5624.3%On-site property manager payroll31,51430,5753.1%64,04462,3202.8%Repairs and maintenance14,66513,6797.2%32,67629,58810.4%Utilities10,06710,611(5.1)%22,63322,5610.3%Marketing14,4699,08659.2%30,02220,80544.3%Other direct property costs22,07320,9115.6%45,29741,6418.8%Total direct cost of operations169,999159,3666.7%348,567324,4777.4%Direct net operating income (b)694,506654,0566.2%1,363,1061,260,7338.1%Indirect cost of operations (a):Supervisory payroll(8,502)(9,059)(6.1)%(17,700)(18,979)(6.7)%Centralized management costs(15,211)(14,440)5.3%(31,108)(31,203)(0.3)%Share-based compensation(2,731)(3,880)(29.6)%(5,870)(7,868)(25.4)%Net operating income (c)$668,062$626,6776.6%$1,308,428$1,202,6838.8%Gross margin (before indirect costs, depreciation and amortization expense)80.3%80.4%(0.1)%79.6%79.5%0.1%Gross margin (before depreciation and amortization expense)77.3%77.0%0.4%76.4%75.9%0.7%Weighted average for the period:Square foot occupancy93.7%95.7%(2.1)%93.5%95.6%(2.2)%Realized annual rental income per (d):Occupied square foot$22.99$21.238.3%$22.82$20.6910.3%Available square foot$21.54$20.326.0%$21.33$19.797.8%At June 30:Square foot occupancy93.2%94.8%(1.7)%Annual contract rent per occupied square foot (e)$23.34$21.807.1%(a)Revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sales and expenses generated at the facilities.(b)Direct net operating income (""Direct NOI""), a subtotal within NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of supervisory payroll, centralized management costs, and share-based compensation in addition to depreciation and amortization expense.

These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency, and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts, which reduce rental income.(e)Annual contract rent represents the agreed upon monthly rate that is paid by our tenants in place at the time of measurement. Contract rates are initially set in the lease agreement upon move-in, and we adjust them from time to time with notice. Contract rent excludes other fees that are charged on a per-item basis, such as late charges and administrative fees, does not reflect the impact of promotional discounts, and does not reflect the impact of rents that are written off as uncollectible.Property Operations – Non-Same Store FacilitiesIn addition to the 2,344 Same Store Facilities, we have 544 facilities that were not stabilized with respect to occupancies, revenues, or cost of operations since January 1, 2021 or that we did not own as of January 1, 2021, including 322 facilities that were acquired, 49 newly developed facilities, 87 facilities that have been expanded or are targeted for expansion, and 86 facilities that are unstabilized because they are undergoing fill-up or were damaged in casualty events (collectively, the ""Non-Same Store Facilities""). Operating data, metrics, and further commentary with respect to these facilities, including detail by vintage, are included in ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" under ""Analysis of Net Income – Self-Storage Operations"" in our June 30, 2023 Form 10-Q.Investing and Capital ActivitiesDuring the three months ended June 30, 2023, we closed the acquisition of eleven self-storage facilities (seven in South Carolina and one each in Florida, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Virginia) with 0.9 million net rentable square feet for $144.0 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we closed the acquisition of 16 self-storage facilities (seven in South Carolina, two each in Florida and Virginia, and one each in Idaho, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, and North Carolina) with 1.2 million net rentable square feet for $190.8 million.On July 24, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement with BREIT to acquire BREIT Simply Storage LLC, a self-storage company that owns and operates 127 self-storage facilities (9.4 million square feet) and manages 25 self-storage facilities (1.8 million square feet) for third parties, for a cash acquisition price of $2.2 billion. The 127 wholly-owned facilities are geographically diversified across 18 states and located in markets with population growth that has been approximately double the national average since 2018. Approximately 65% of the facilities are located in high-growth Sunbelt markets. The acquisition, which is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, is currently expected to close in the third quarter of 2023.Subsequent to June 30, 2023, we acquired or were under contract to acquire eleven self-storage facilities across six states with 0.8 million net rentable square feet, for $118.2 million.During 2021, we acquired a portfolio of 48 properties (4.1 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of ezStorage for $1.8 billion. As of June 30, 2023, we have completed the expansion projects on four facilities of this portfolio for $26.4 million, adding 169,000 net rentable square feet of storage space. These facilities generated revenues of $51.7 million, NOI of $40.4 million (including Direct NOI of $41.7 million), and average square footage occupancy of 85.7% for the six months ended June 30, 2023.During 2021, we acquired a portfolio of 56 properties (7.5 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of All Storage for $1.5 billion. These facilities generated revenues of $43.1 million, NOI of $27.4 million (including Direct NOI of $28.9 million), and average square footage occupancy of 78.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2023.During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we completed various expansion projects (0.2 million net rentable square feet in California) costing $19.1 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we opened three newly developed facilities and completed various expansion projects (0.6 million net rentable square feet – 0.2 million in California and 0.1 million each in Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) costing $84.4 million. At June 30, 2023, we had various facilities in development (2.5 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $554.0 million and various expansion projects (2.3 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $473.0 million. Our aggregate 4.8 million net rentable square foot pipeline of development and expansion facilities includes 1.5 million in California, 0.9 million in Texas, 0.4 million in Nevada, 0.3 million each in Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, and Maryland, 0.2 million in Washington, and 0.6 million in other states. The remaining $577.0 million of development costs for these projects are expected to be incurred primarily in the next 18 to 24 months.In connection with the Simply Acquisition, on July 24, 2023, we completed a public offering of $400 million, $500 million, $700 million, and $600 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes bearing interest at an annual rate of Compounded SOFR + 0.60% (reset quarterly), 5.125%, 5.100%, and 5.350%, respectively, and maturing on July 25, 2025, January 15, 2029, August 1, 2033, and August 1, 2053, respectively.Distributions DeclaredOn August 2, 2023, our Board of Trustees declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $3.00 per common share. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on September 28, 2023 to shareholders of record as of September 13, 2023.Outlook for the Year Ending December 31, 2023Set forth below are our current expectations with respect to full year 2023 Core FFO per share and certain underlying assumptions including the proposed Simply Acquisition and the issuance of $2.2 billion of U.S. Dollar denominated unsecured senior notes on July 24, 2023. In reliance on the exception provided by applicable SEC rules, we do not provide guidance for GAAP net income per share, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, or a reconciliation of 2023 Core FFO per share to GAAP net income per share because we are unable to reasonably predict the following items which are included in GAAP net income: (i) gains or losses on sales of real estate investments, (ii) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (iii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities, and (iv) certain other significant non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items.

Entertainment Segment guidance is updated to reflect the reality of the writers' and actors' strikes on the eOne Film and TV business. The updated guidance assumes eOne Film and TV is included for the entire fiscal year and guidance will be updated once the eOne Film and TV sale transaction is complete.The Company now expects:Revenue decline of 3-6% driven by the Entertainment Segment.No change to Consumer Product guidance of down mid-single digits.Increasing guidance on Wizards of the Coast Segment to up high-single digits.Reducing outlook on Entertainment to down 25 to 30%.Adjusted operating margin up 20 to 50 basis points versus last year's adjusted operating margin1Consumer Products segment and Wizards and Digital Gaming segment margin outlook unchanged from prior guidance.Entertainment segment margin is now expected to decline as a result of the D&amp;D film impairment and the ongoing industry strikes.The Company continues to expect:Adjusted EBITDA approximately flat with 2022 adjusted EBITDA.Operating Cash Flow of $600 to $700 million.1The Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA measures because the Company cannot predict with certainty the timing and amounts of discrete items such as charges associated with its cost-savings program, which could impact GAAP results. Guidance does not reflect the announced sale of select entertainment assets. The Company plans to update its outlook upon completion of the transaction.Conference Call WebcastHasbro will webcast its second quarter 2023 earnings conference call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time today.

Also included in this press release are the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA represents net earnings attributable to Hasbro, Inc. excluding interest expense, income tax expense, net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes Operational Excellence and Blueprint 2.0 implementation charges, certain non-cash asset impairment charges and the impact of stock compensation (including acquisition-related stock expense). As required by SEC rules, we have provided reconciliations on the attached schedules of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that Adjusted net earnings, Adjusted net earnings per diluted share and Adjusted operating profit provide investors with an understanding of the underlying performance of our business absent unusual events. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate measures for evaluating the operating performance of our business because they reflect the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, to invest in the business, strengthen the balance sheet and make strategic acquisitions. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the consolidated statements of operations is quantified by translating the current period revenues at the prior period exchange rates and comparing this amount to the prior period reported revenues. The Company believes that the presentation of the impact of changes in exchange rates, which are beyond the Company’s control, is helpful to an investor’s understanding of the performance of the underlying business.

The Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut, and Habit Burger owner opened roughly 8,700 locations in the past two years. That calculates to a store every two hours, across the globe, for 24 straight months, or 730 days. In fiscal 2022-its 25th as a public company-Yum! opened 4,560 gross new units, which topped a previous high mark it set a year earlier at 4,180.As of the end of 2022, the company committed about $50 million to help fund more than 30 social impact programs in 11 countries.Every employee is required to certify Yum!'s ""Global Code of Conduct"" as part of annual compliance training, which also covers anti-discrimination and harassment. Yum! tapped an independent, third-party-operated ethics hotline and online portal, known as The Speak Up Helpline, for employees to reach 24/7. It's translated across nine different languages.In recent years, however, this wider movement to foster culture and talent at Yum! has been characterized by newly refined values, and an ""EIB [equity, inclusion and belonging] mindset,"" the company said.Yum! struck several cross-sector partnerships, like Hispanic Promise, which is a national pledge to hire, promote, retain, and celebrate Hispanics in the workplaces; and the CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusions. As a member of OneTen Coalition, Yum! teams with other U.S. businesses to create career mobility and advancement opportunities for a million Black/African-America individuals over 10 years.

Brands missed on revenue estimates. KFC saw the highest growth in sales among the company's fast-food brands, pushing its same-store sales higher by 13%. Yahoo Finance Reporter Brooke DiPalma breaks down the biggest takeaways from Yum! Brands' earnings call, including its record $7 billion in digital sales and new location additions.Video Transcript- Yum brands dropped its second quarter earnings this morning seeing a miss on revenue. The fast food corporation saw worldwide system sales grow 3% with KFC boosting sales, especially in China. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma to break down the earnings. Brooke, please.BROOKE DIPALMA: That's right. Well, earnings came out around 7:00 this morning. Then we heard from them around 8:15. And certainly, it was a call that covered a lot. I mean, inflation and consumer behavior as well as pricing power and innovation were just some of the highlights of the call. Of course, they did miss revenue estimates despite KFC seeing same store sales higher. Taco Bell, Pizza Hut did miss same store sales last quarter.But the big story here, KFC seeing same store sales move higher at 13% largely boosted by that China reopening. But taking a closer look at what exactly was mentioned in the call, we did see record digital sales of $7 billion this past quarter, a digital mix exceeding 45%. Across all four brands, our digital sales were up nearly 30% year over year.In addition to that, we are seeing a different consumer behavior when it comes to how exactly they play. With digital Taco Bell here in the US now 100% of locations now have kiosks. And at Habit Burger Grill, one of their smaller businesses, they noted that with the rollout of kiosk now in 60% of their stores, an average kiosk sees about 10% higher checks compared with front counter sales. They also said it was yet another proof point of the value from converting to digital sales.Story continuesBut one of my favorites here, they did weigh in on KFC nuggets. They said that over 100 million were sold in the first eight weeks. They said this proves that product innovation is met with positive consumer reaction. Of course, we got a first look at those last year. They do tend to skew to a lower-- to a rather a Gen Z younger audience, which is awesome there as they look to really engage the next generation. And unit growth was a big story on the earnings call. They did add more than 1,000 new units in the second quarter.And CEO, David Gibbs, really saying here on the call that in the last 2 and 1/2 years, they added 10,000 new stores to the Yum system. And that makes them about 20% of our stores. So necessarily, they built 20% more stores in the last 2 and 1/2 years. So lots of momentum this past quarter. Shares now slightly up.- Let me ask you then because I know the CEO was on the call giving some insight about not only inflation, but you're talking about their expansion in locations. Where are they gaining market share?BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah, well really, they're gaining market share here from a lower income audience. On the call, they gave some insight that some of those pandemic trends that they were seeing like, bigger party sizes are now transferring back to pre-pandemic trends, like more individual meal occasions and party sizes going back down. But the CEO, David Gibbs, did weigh in on the call about how value is a key strategy here and how it's gaining market share from that. Take a listen.DAVID GIBBS: This is an environment where we can succeed. Value is rising in importance, but we have solutions and in many ways, our leaders with our brands. KFC for us, for example, in the quarter, their most growth was seen in their low income consumers because they had always on value for the quarter as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So we can win in this environment in developed markets.BROOKE DIPALMA: Always on value. That was KFC's key strategy to gain market share as consumers look to ultimately save when dining out or look to change exactly where they're looking to dine out. But another bright spot of this past quarter they mentioned in the call is they said it's a stable positive environment, and they think that inflation peaked in most markets here in the US, especially. So lots of momentum.My overall vibe of the call, I would say it was fine. I said the momentum is there but they did miss at Taco Bell and Pizza Hut on same store sales. So I ultimately think lots more outlook to the second half of this year, how exactly consumer behavior continues to change but ultimately, positive momentum going into the back half.- Yeah, it sounds like a bit of a good news on the inflation front. Thank you for that. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma.]"

Same-store sales did beat estimates across the board for Yum! Brands with the exception of Pizza Hut. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down the numbers.Video Transcript- We're watching shares of Yum after the fast food giant saw same store-- same store sales, excuse me. That's a tongue twister. Always, that's why I say comp sales, rise 9% year over year, driven by a 13% sales jump at KFC as promotional efforts paid off. Now, this stock has been fluctuating a little bit. It was earlier a little higher, investors again, trying to digest. Pardon the pun. Actually, don't pardon the pun. Its results.So it did-- I mean, there was one interesting tidbit in its earnings that stood out to me in terms of digital sales. I'm like, why are people shopping at these--- Because you order online.- But it's food. I don't--- You don't order?- No. Well, the only place I do the app is like, Starbucks, which we did--- You don't do DoorDash or--- Well, not for fast food. Why would you DoorDash KFC and so--- A lot of people do that or they order it ahead and then they go and pick it up just like your Starbucks.- OK, that's fine. So they pick up. But I just feel like that is so lazy. But apparently, it was record digital sales. Records.- Everything's digital now, baby. That's the way it's going. A couple of things that stood out to me too is maybe putting some pressure on the sales here. The comps overall, to your point, did beat estimates. I say comps to it, it's easier. Pizza Hut comps though missed estimates. They were up by 4% but analysts were looking for more than 6% gain. And Taco Bell comps missed a little bit up 4%. The estimate there for a gain of 4.6%. So despite the much touted return of Mexican pizza, it doesn't seem to have given this.No. KFC is the winner, Pizza Hut.Story continues- Exactly.- KFC then Pizza Hut apparently.- Yeah, so I guess so.]"

But it's his drive and dedication that have propelled him through a lifelong career with McDonald's, helping him grow from a 16-year-old crew member to a Franchisee with three restaurants in the Portland area.The journey beginsBorn in Guadalajara, Mexico, Juan immigrated to the U.S. when he was just 5 years old - the result of his father's hard work as a migrant farm worker in fields throughout the West Coast. When he turned 16, Juan got his first job at a McDonald's restaurant in Pico Rivera, California, where he worked through high school and college.As he started his own family, Juan's ambitions continued to grow. He was promoted to Assistant Manager and then Store Manager before accepting a business consultant role in the Rocky Mountain region - his first big move with McDonald's Corporate. The opportunities didn't stop there: He relocated to Arizona to become a bilingual consultant and later a director of operations for a local Franchisee. Juan then became a franchise business partner in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas before taking the opportunity to lead McDelivery efforts for the Long Beach Field Office.""The possibilities at McDonald's are endless,"" Juan says. ""I've never been bored because there are so many avenues to pursue within the company. I have mentors in marketing, finance and operations who have shown me that the next opportunity is always there if you know where to look.""Building the American dreamAfter almost 30 years with McDonald's, Juan was ready to own part of the business and become a Franchisee. He dove headfirst into the selection and training process in late 2021 - a year he describes as the toughest yet most rewarding of his career. From in-restaurant immersions to online courses at Hamburger University and mentorship from veteran Franchisees, this program covers all aspects of owning and operating McDonald's restaurants so that new Franchisees are set up for success.Around the same time, McDonald's announced its plan to increase global ownership opportunities for new talent from all backgrounds, committing $250 million in alternative financing options over five years to aspiring U.S. Franchisees facing socio-economic barriers. As of the end of 2022, new Franchisees took advantage of more than $50 million in alternative financing - including Juan, who tapped into this resource to purchase a trio of restaurants in Portland, Oregon, one year ago.The next generationJust like his father did for him and his siblings, Juan is hopeful that his hard work will build a lasting legacy for his daughters and grandchildren. And now that he's fulfilled his dream of becoming a Franchisee, he has a new goal in mind: growing his organization to own 10 McDonald's restaurants.Despite all of his success, Juan still sees himself in his youngest crew members. He takes the time to help them find their next opportunity, whether it's through improving English speaking and writing with English Under the Arches or pursuing a high school diploma or college degree through Archways to Opportunity.""I always tell people that you can get whatever you want from McDonald's - whether you want to be in the restaurant or build a career in technology, marketing or HR,"" Juan says.

452,9e14adcd-da7e-31bb-b5f0-df1626262d0f,MCD,2023-08-03,Best Long-Term Investment Stocks to Buy,Kiplinger,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-long-term-investment-stocks-172831591.html,1690997311,STORY,"['CVX', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'MCD', 'MDT', 'SCHW']","[Some of the best long-term investment stocks include companies that are in good financial standing, have a low valuation and pay consistent dividends.Folks seeking out the best long-term investment stocks to buy have a few ways to approach the task. One is to follow the advice of Ben Graham, the father of value investing, using his classic book, The Intelligent Investor.Graham suggests that a defensive investor should buy stocks of large, conservatively financed companies with good earnings power. The companies should also be some of the best dividend stocks, with consistent histories of payouts, and have low valuations.However, in today's world, many tech stocks don't pay dividends. Instead, they often return capital to shareholders through large stock buybacks.Therefore, applying Graham's criteria today, the idea is to find the best stocks to buy that return large amounts of capital to shareholders either through dividends and/or stock buybacks.This allows a company to increase its earnings and dividends on a per-share basis. Moreover, the remaining shareholder's stakes rise over time. Both of these factors can push the stock higher.Another Graham criteria is to find stocks with a low valuation. The S&amp;P 500 has a relatively high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31.4 times over the last 10 years. This article will focus on stocks with price-to-earnings ratios that are lower than the broad market.Lastly, we will stick with stocks that have market caps of $100 billion or higher. They must also have low debt ratios and enough cash flow to reduce their debt, as well as pay dividends and/or buybacks.With this in mind, here are the nine of the best long-term investment stocks to buy now. What Is a Stock Buyback?Data is as of Aug. 1. Dividend yields are calculated by annualizing the most recent payout and dividing by the share price.Market value: $3.08 trillionDividend yield: 0.5%Apple (AAPL, $195.60) is the $3 trillion maker of iPhone smartphones, Mac computers, iPads and numerous other products and services.Story continuesiPhones still represent over half of the company's sales, but recently services, which includes the App Store, have started to increase as well. For example, in its latest quarter ending April 1, Apple's services revenue came in at $20.9 billion, or 22% of its $94.8 billion in sales. That is up from 20% a year ago and 18.9% two years ago.So, this massive tech products company is slowly shedding its overreliance on the iPhone, whose models are all very highly priced. While this will take time, the market so far approves of this plan.And why not? The company is generating massive amounts of free cash flow (FCF), which is the money left over after a company covers expenses to run, maintain and expand the business. Last quarter, Apple said it generated strong operating cash flow of $28.6 billion, while returning over $23 billion to shareholders.Apple pays a small dividend, which it recently raised by 4% to 96 cents annually. That gives the stock a low 0.5% dividend yield. However, this cost the company just $3.7 billion, or 13% of its operating flow.The rest of the $23 billion ""returned"" to shareholders was through stock buybacks. In fact, Apple raised the amount it says it will spend this year on share repurchases to $90 billion. That represents over 3.3% of its total market value.This will benefit long-term shareholders in Apple stock. First, it will raise AAPL's earnings per share over time through having a lower number of shares outstanding for the income it produces.But in addition, the dividend per share can rise faster than it would otherwise since the dividend payments will be spread over fewer number of shares outstanding. And a third effect will be the soaking up of shares traded in the market – effectively acting as a buying source in the market, pushing the blue chip stock higher.Keep in mind that APPL stock is not overly cheap at the moment, at 28.7 times forward earnings – above its five-year average of 23.7, according to Morningstar. However, it is about below the S&amp;P 500's average, as mentioned earlier.Nevertheless, Apple remains one of the best long-term investment stocks due to its consistent and powerful cash flow, dividends and buybacks.Best Dividend ETFs to Buy NowMarket value: $2.50 trillionDividend yield: 0.8%Microsoft (MSFT, $336.34) operates in every key software arena: operating systems, cloud, gaming, application software, and even artificial intelligence (AI) with its new Bing chatbot.MSFT meets all the necessary qualities for being one of the best long-term investment stocks as it has consistent earnings, is conservatively financed and generates large amounts of free cash flow. Moreover, it pays a dividend and spends most of its FCF on share buybacks.Just like Apple, however, MSFT stock is not necessarily cheap on a relative or even historical basis. For example, Microsoft is trading at 30.4 times forward earnings, which is above its five-year average of 28.6. Still, it's below the S&amp;P 500's long-term average.And long-term investors are likely to do quite well with MSFT. The reasons are quite simple: The company's massive cash flow, its products ubiquity and acceptance, and its shareholder rewards are all working in the stock's favor.For example, Microsoft recently reported a 21% year-over-year increase in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share, while revenue was up 8%. Plus, free cash flow was up 12% from the year prior.But more importantly, the company has plenty of room to increase its shareholder-friendly initiatives over time. This is because it spends just about half its free cash flow on dividends and buybacks. It plows the rest back into the company, reducing debt and making investments and acquisitions.So, in the long run, Microsoft shareholders can expect the company to typically grow profits and cash flow, while consistently hiking its dividends and buybacks. In fact, Microsoft has had 18 consecutive years of raising its dividend. That alone, not counting its buybacks and earnings power, makes the Dow Jones stock worthy of holding as a long-term investment.How to Invest in AIMarket value: $303.4 billionDividend yield: 3.7%Chevron (CVX, $162.30) is an integrated energy and chemicals company with both upstream and downstream operations in the U.S. and around the world.CVX meets the criteria for a good long-term investment as it is conservatively financed, produces good profits and pays an attractive dividend it can afford. Moreover, CVX stock is not expensive and the company is actively buying back shares, helping to push it higher.For example, analysts expect Chevron to make $11.94 per share in fiscal 2023, which has the energy stock trading at 13.6 times forward earnings. This is well below the five-year average of 37.9 times.Moreover, Chevron has 36 years of annual dividend hikes under its belt. This is because despite vicissitudes in the prices of oil and gas and chemical industry cycles, the company has consistently produced large amounts of free cash flow.For example, in Q2, Chevron generated $9.4 billion in operating cash flow before working capital changes, and $2.5 billion in free cash flow. The company spent $2.8 billion on dividends and $4.4 billion on share buybacks, for a record $7.2 billion in total shareholder returns.This shows how Chevron manages a fair balance between investing in the future, as well as rewarding its own shareholders now with its cash flow. And it underscores why CVX is the kind of stock that long-term investors want to have in their portfolio.Stocks With the Highest Dividend Yields in the S&amp;P 500Market value: $116.7 billionDividend yield: 3.2%Medtronic (MDT, $87.68) is a $117 billion medical device and therapies company that originally invented the pacemaker. That is probably relatable to people who are looking for the best retirement stocks. Moreover, the company is extremely profitable, which allows it to pay generous dividends and do large share buybacks.Right now, MDT stock has a 3.2% dividend yield. And this yield will likely continue to rise, given the company has reliably raised its dividend for 46 straight years – including a 1.5% hike in May.Moreover, in fiscal 2023, which ended on April 28, Medtronic bought back $645 million of its shares. That works out to be about 55% of one percent of its $117 billion market cap.That is not much, but every little bit helps towards allowing the company to keep raising its dividend.In addition, at just 17.1 times forward earnings, the stock is inexpensive. What's more, this is well below MDT's five-year average of 19.1 times, according to Morningstar.Meanwhile, Medtronic has about $17 billion in net debt on its balance sheet. This is well below its $52 billion in shareholders' equity. Its cash flow should continue to recover from supply chain issues we've seen in the past few years. That will allow Medtronic to reduce its debt reliance over time.And given its powerful cash flow and shareholder returns, MDT is one of the best long-term investment stocks.Bull Markets vs Bear Markets: The Differences ExplainedMarket value: $119.6 billionDividend yield: 1.5%Charles Schwab (SCHW, $65.72) is a well-known discount brokerage firm and investment banking company with which many baby boomers are familiar.SCHW meets all the best criteria for a long-term investment value strategy. For example, it is conservatively financed, pays a consistent dividend with a 1.5% yield, and has a low valuation.As for that dividend, Schwab has had 34 years of consistently paying its dividend each year. That is well over the 10-year average of the median in its sector.Moreover, Schwab recently reported that its return on equity was 20% in the six months ended June 30, up from 15% in the year-ago period. This indicates a substantial rebound in its earnings power. It also allays concerns that the bank might have been hurt by investors worried about a potential recession.Meanwhile, the financial stock is trading at 17.2 times forward earnings, well below its five-year average of 18.6.While the company did recently decide to pause its share buyback program in light of uncertainty in the financial sector following the spring banking crisis. This is likely to reverse once the Federal Reserve stops pushing interest rates higher, which could act as a major catalyst.Investing Jargon, ExplainedMarket value: $212.5 billionDividend yield: 2.1%McDonald's (MCD, $291.07) is a company that just about every investor knows well, especially if they have children. But few realize that it is actually quite a good long-term investment stock to buy as well.The main reason is that the company generates large amounts of free cash flow. For example, in the last 12 months (LTM) ending March 31, MCD produced $5.7 billion in FCF. That represents 2.7% of its $212 billion market capitalization.MCD uses its free cash flow to pay a very ample dividend, which now yields 2.1%. In addition, it bought back almost $3 billion of its shares over the last year.While some folks might not like MCD's quick service restaurant food, plenty of others do. They love its menu, buy McDonald's fries and hamburgers and generally can't get enough of its food.Moreover, it is conservatively financed as its $37 billion in long-term debt, $33.3 billion after cash, is well-managed by the company's ongoing FCF generation.In addition, shareholders have benefited by its history of annually raising its dividend over the last 46 years.Along with its buybacks, MCD stock is attractively valued. For example, it trades for just 26.8 times earnings. While certainly not cheap, this is below its five-year averageThe bottom line – everyone is ""lovin"" MCD stock for the long term.Stock Picks That Billionaires LoveMarket value: $368.3 billionDividend yield: 2.4%Procter &amp; Gamble (PG, $156.25) is a nearly $370 billion consumer products giant with many iconic brand names – including Downy detergent, Mr. Clean cleaning supplies and Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo – that produce large amounts of cash flow for the company.Most everyone knows Procter &amp; Gamble's brands and are familiar with their solid reputations. But few realize how incredibly profitable the company actually is and why PG is one of the best long-term investment stocks to buy.For example, in the last 12 months ended June 30, PG generated $15.2 billion in operating cash and after $3.0 billion in capex spending, $12.2 billion in free cash flow.The FCF represents a massive 15% of P&amp;G's $81 billion LTM sales, which is a very high free cash flow margin for a consumer products company. In fact, some software companies don't even make those kinds of margins.Moreover, this FCF also funds massive dividends and buybacks for shareholders. The company has raised its dividend annually for the last 66 years. Moreover, in its recent earnings call, Procter and Gamble management said it expects to buy back $5 billion to $6 billion in common stock this fiscal year. That represents about 1.5% of its market capitalization.Nevertheless, PG is not expensive relative to its historical valuation. It trades for just 26.5 times earnings, which is well below its five-year average of 35.0.In other words, Procter &amp; Gamble is reasonably priced, generates large amounts of cash flow from its brands and is working diligently to return value to shareholders. That makes it one of the best long-term investments value buyers can make.Best Defensive ETFs to Protect Your PortfolioMarket value: $61.0 billionDividend yield: 5.4%3M (MMM, $110.56) is a $61 billion industrial conglomerate that operates in four sectors: safety and industrial; transportation and electronics; healthcare; and consumer. The company's mission is to apply science to improve people's lives daily.But MMM is also one of the best long-term investment stocks for folks to own. For example, 3M generated $1.5 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter, and returned $800 million to shareholders via dividends.On top of that, 3M buys back its common stock, with the company repurchasing $1.4 billion of its own shares in 2022.Given its free cash flow, investors can take comfort in knowing that MMM's $6.00 annual dividend, which yields an attractive 5.4%, is probably secure.Plus, 3M stock is cheap, trading at just 11.6 times forward earnings, well below its five-year average of 16.6.Moreover, 3M is conservatively financed. The company reported $11.7 billion in net debt at the end of Q2, which was down 12% on a year-over-year basis.Given its strong cash flow, dividends, buybacks, low valuation and financing, the industrial stock looks like a good long-term investment for value buyers.Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying and SellingMarket value: $267.1 billionDividend yield: 3.0%Coca-Cola (KO, $61.77) is an iconic beverage company that generates large amounts of cash flow for its shareholders with its well-known brands such as Coke, Diet Coke, Fanta, Powerade and Minute Maid.That makes it one of the best long term investments a value buyer can make – just ask Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) holding company is KO's top shareholder. What makes KO so attractive is that it is one of the best dividend stocks on Wall Street, having increased its payouts consistently for the last 60 years straight. Most recently, Coca-Cola in February hiked its dividend by nearly 5%.Today, KO stock yields an attractive 3%, and investors can expect the dividend rate to keep increasing.On top of that, Coca-Cola has a strong common stock buyback program. For example, in the last 12 months ended June 30, it spent $872 million on share repurchases. That represents 33% of 1.0% of its $267 billion market value.KO's dividends and share buybacks are more than covered by $9.5 billion in FCF that management expects to generate during 2023.On top of that, the consumer staples stock is trading at 25.6 times earnings, well below its five-year average of 32.1.So, for the long term-investor, KO stock looks like a good investment, given its strong cash flows and shareholder-friendly initiatives.]"

Starbucks earned a net income of $1.41 billion, or 99 cents per share, rising from last year’s comparable quarter when it made $912.9 million, or 79 cents per share. Adjusted earnings per share came to $1, topping 95 cents that Refinitiv’s survey of analysts expected.With improved productivity and higher menu prices, operating margin expanded from 15.9% to 17.3%.Same-store sales both in North America and international markets was weaker than expected. The rise of 10% was below the 11% growth that StreetAccount estimated. The U.S. and China made 61% of the coffee giant’s portfolio.Non-US same-store sales expanded 24%, below the estimated 24.2%. Like McDonald’s, Starbucks’ international growth was fueled by China whose same-store sales skyrocketed 46%. International transactions rose 21%, slightly less the expected 23%. But the average ticket was only up 2%, far below the expected 8%, suggesting that consumers are spending less.Trouble On The Domestic Front?Unlike McDonald’s whose same-store U.S. sales rose 10.3% with visits rising for the fourth straight quarter, there seems to be trouble for Starbucks at its home market. Unlike McDonald’s who reported double-digit growth for same-store sales across all three of its divisions, Starbuck’s North America same-store sales grew only 7% below the estimated 8.4%, customer traffic grew 1% at the coffee giant’s domestic market as customers were getting more sandwiches and extras like cold foam to their coffees, with the undergoing consumer trend shifting away from hot coffees to cold beverages that made three quarters of beverage orders in the U.S. With higher prices and these additions, the average ticket size jumped 6% in the region. However, transactions only rose 1%, below the expected 3%Story continuesThe loyalty app continues to grow, again gaining momentum during the reported quarter with total active members rising 15% YoY to 31.4 million.Reaffirmed Fiscal 2023 OutlookRevenue is projected to grow between 10% and 12% while adjusted EPS guidance was slightly changed from its prior range of 15% to 20% to a new window between 16% and 17%. Despite mixed results and weaker than expected sales, CEO Laxman Narasimhan remains confident of Starbucks’ strong growth narrative with multiple paths going forward on its quest to further improve its margins.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

No Mcdonalds 😂"" to which Zuckerberg shot back: ""Not cutting weight so I need ~4000 calories a day to offset all the activity. And it's so delicious...""In good companyZuckerberg isn't the only tech titan partial to a sweet treat.Twitter owner Musk—an opponent in a rivalry that goes so deep it resulted in a proposal of a physical fight in June—has openly said he eats a doughnut every day for breakfast.Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett famously told Fortune he has the ""diet of a 6-year-old.""“If I eat 2,700 calories a day, a quarter of that is Coca-Cola. I drink at least five 12-ounce servings.

Chris Caton, Prologis Managing Director of Global Strategy and Analytics, joins Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre to discuss the resiliency of the logistics real estate industry, while also acknowledging scarcity challenges for customers.Video TranscriptJARED BLIKRE: Fitch has downgraded the US government's credit rating. This is only the second time it's ever happened. The first was in 2011 when fellow credit rating agency, S&amp;P, took the rating to the same level, that would be AA+. Now Fitch said its move reflects an quote, ""erosion of government's which has manifested in repeat debt limit stand offs. So what's the fallout for business and how capital is actually deployed. We're going to bring in now Chris Caton, Prologis managing director for global strategy and analytics.You've taken a look at what's happened today, and there must be some kind of spillover effect in your neck of the woods. I'm just wondering how in general you're looking at this development.CHRIS CATON: Hey, Jared, glad to be here. Sure, so Prologis is the world's largest owner and developer of logistics real estate. So many of our customers, whether it's Amazon, Walmart, DHL, this doesn't directly, I think, impact the flow of goods around the world.Now, we do acquire and develop properties everywhere around the world. And so the cost of capital matters. Whether it's a change in interest rates today or the change in interest rates over the last 18 months. And we are looking forward to providing recapitalization opportunities. We're going to be an investor through this uncertainty and recovery. And we have already factored in this change in interest rates into our thinking. So in some respects, we had anticipated volatility and have priced things accordingly.JARED BLIKRE: Well, sounds pretty prescient there. Let me ask you about your wheelhouse here. At July, industrial business indicator, that's the IBI, it's showing an uptick in the goods economy. And I'm just wondering because we're so worried about inflation with respect to the service side, is this something else that we should be concerned about or is this actually a good thing that we're looking at?Story continuesCHRIS CATON: Well look, I think it for sure is a good thing. So for those who may not be familiar, Prologis surveys their customers on a monthly basis. We are the world's largest provider of space. And for many of our customers, we are their largest provider of space. We ask them after their activity, and we're publishing today our July report. And that figure tells us growth is not just resilient but actually pretty good.And that's a key question, I think, that we've been facing this year as economic crosscurrents have surfaced and wondering what direction the logistics real estate industry might head. And so indeed, we've been calling for normalization in the market environment, and that's what we think we're seeing.For further historical context, 2021, 2022 were exceptional years. And so this normalization is taking us back to 2018, 2019 levels in a rather steady glide path if I'm candid. And so what that's revealing to us is the importance and ongoing support that we get from the structural drivers of our industry.JARED BLIKRE: And talk to me then about the supply of I guess, real estate units on the market right here square footage. I'm reading some from your report here. The true months of supply TMS rose to 36 and 1/2 months, and that's increased by 6 and 1/2 months from the prior quarter. Contextually, how does this relate historically? Because 6 and 1/2 months increase in supply might seem a lot to us but historically, we've seen it probably surge quite a bit more during the global financial crisis, for instance.CHRIS CATON: You're exactly right. So indeed, the industry is one that still faces scarcity. The market vacancy rate across the United States is 4%. The typical historical range is 7% to 10%. And we had, like you just said, a market vacancy rate of 10% through the global financial crisis. And you're right, that other metric that we maintained from a proprietary standpoint was 100 or more on the global financial crisis. So indeed, there remains scarcity. And this is a key challenge for our customers who need to plan earlier and more proactively to secure the real estate they need to ensure the efficient flow of goods around the world and into the United States.And so what this means is we have ongoing pricing power. Rent growth continues to grow in line or in many cases, faster than inflation really nearly everywhere around the world.JARED BLIKRE: Well, so if I'm hearing you correctly, it sounds like business people should be a little bit more concerned about scarcity, at least future scarcity in this market. Anything else that investors-- and let me know if I have that right or wrong. But anything else that investors, people who use your services, just people in the economy in general should be keeping their eye on?CHRIS CATON: No, you're spot on. You're totally reading the situation correctly. I think one thing that we're starting to do is peek into 2024 and ask, what could happen to that two months of supply metric? What could happen to that market vacancy rate? And one thing that we haven't discussed though is hey, how are new suppliers, new product coming to the market in response to this scarcity and this ongoing rent growth.And there's a little bit of a paradox here. In fact, we're seeing a complete deceleration in new supply coming to the market. New development starts are off 50% from a year ago, and this really relates to the move in interest rates and also candidly, the cost to build our buildings and the availability of debt, say from the banking community and how they're managing their relationships as well as their capital reserves. And so that presents opportunity and risk as we peek into 2024.JARED BLIKRE: Some surprising insights there. Really appreciate you stopping by. Chris Caton, Prologis managing director for global strategy and analytics.]"

But its parent company is spending nearly as much money as it generates to elevate Viator’s positioning as an experiences platform.Tripadvisor’s total revenue for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023, saw 18% growth to $494 million. Viator brought in $216 million in revenue – up from $136 million. Tripadvisor’s Core Revenue saw a 2% increase, at $279 million versus $274 million in the same period a year ago.Excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations, Tripadvisor estimated year-over-year growth was 61% for its experiences booking platform. Viator’s Gross bookings value (GBV) increased by 40% to approximately $1.1 billion. GBV is reported at the time of booking and is gross of cancellations, fees, and deductions. In contrast, revenue is recorded at the time of the experience and is net of cancellations.Growth and performance marketing underscores the bottom line as Tripadvisor continues to invest in Viator’s brand, with selling and marketing costs of $270 million (up 24% from last year), taking up a 55% chunk of revenue in the second quarter, compared to 52% in the same period a year ago. The increase as a percent of revenue was primarily due to an increase in Viator marketing costs, which includes brand spend, the company said in its second-quarter earnings statement.“We delivered healthy revenue growth on a consolidated basis, most notably in our experiences offerings, where we are pleased with our strong performance and market leadership in a large and growing category,” said Chief Executive Officer Matt Goldberg in the earnings statement.Goldberg added that the company would balance “financial discipline with engagement-driven strategic priorities.”Tech investment accounted for 14% of total revenue, primarily due to higher people costs. The company has thrown its hat into the AI-driven travel tools race with the release of its itinerary planner in July. While it’s not a chatbot, the tool is only available on the web. The tool’s release came as competitor experiences platform GetYourGuide revealed its AI-driven tours and activities plugin in May this year.Story continues“Our experiences category outperformed, while the rest of the business delivered largely within expectations with the exception of our European-sourced hotel revenue,” said Chief Financial Officer Mike Noonan.“We have initiated cost savings actions that will provide flexibility in prioritizing our strategic investment as we finish 2023, plan for 2024, and bolster our path to our long-term financial objectives.”Lackluster performance from branded hotels saw a decline of 7% in revenue at $174 million. TheFork generated $38 million in revenue, a 19% increase and a 5% increase in the total number of bookings, compared to the same period last year. The timing of brand-related campaigns in the second quarter of 2022 and the recovery in dining demand versus the prior year period drove a tougher comparison year over year in bookings growth, according to the company’s statement.Tripadvisor saw a net income of $24 million, or $0.17 diluted earnings per share(EPS). Non-GAAP net income of $49 million, or $0.34 diluted EPS. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization was $90 million, or 18% of revenue.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $417 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.TripAdvisor shares have added about 2.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.2%.What's Next for TripAdvisor?While TripAdvisor has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions.

The agreement would raise wages for all UPS workers, provide another paid holiday, end a two-tier wage system for drivers and add air conditioning to new models of the company's ubiquitous brown trucks, according to the Teamsters.Leaders from Teamsters locals oversee messaging and ""sell"" the deal to members, who vote through Aug. 22.Analysts who follow UPS expect workers to ratify the deal but caution that anti-corporate sentiment is running high and note that some part-timers are grappling to make ends meet.An employee group called Teamsters Mobilize is running a ""Vote No"" campaign seeking a better deal for part-time workers, whose hourly wage is significantly below that of full-timers, said Peter Lyngso, a group leader in Chicago who joined UPS more than a year ago.The group is seeking part-time base pay of at least $25.

Mehrotra estimated that the tab will increase by $2.45 billion in the first 12 months, which would carry from the second half of 2023 through the first half of 2024. The increases would taper off to $530 million each in 2025 and 2026, $700 million in 2027 and $1.6 billion in 2028, the fifth and final year, he estimated.Average hourly wages, which are currently at $30.13 per hour, would rise to $38.36 by year five, Mehrotra estimated. Again, the biggest increases would come in years one and five.With those estimates, UPS (NYSE: UPS) will need to raise domestic prices by $1.11 per package, or 8.8% cumulatively, to offset the entire cost increase over the contract’s five-year duration, Mehrotra said. This figure is “very manageable” considering that core prices are up 5% this year during a period of slack volumes.The estimates are conservative because they assume no growth from current levels and no offsets from higher productivity, Mehrotra said. The agreement is expected to allow UPS to lean in more heavily on automation in order to drive down its cost per package.The “absolute numbers” are not as relevant as what level of pricing growth is needed to offset the level of inflation while maintaining the potential for profit improvement and margin expansion, Mehrotra said. “In this context, we are very positive” on the deal.While acknowledging that the company will absorb a “big pay increase,” Mehrotra said the contract strikes a solid balance between rewarding UPS workers and continuing down the “path to profitable growth.” He has a buy rating on UPS shares.Story continuesThe tentative contract, agreed to July 25, was overwhelmingly endorsed by leaders of 262 Teamster locals on Monday. The contract will go out to the 340,000 rank-and-file members Thursday. Voting ends Aug. 22.Mehrotra’s bullish thesis runs in stark contrast to recent remarks on LinkedIn by Donald Broughton, a longtime transport analyst and principal and managing partner at Broughton Capital LLC. Broughton said the cost increases in hourly pay alone will result in margin pressure that’s 300 basis points higher than what bullish analysts are forecasting.UPS “caved” to the Teamsters’ contract demands because it was losing “increasingly larger amounts” of market share to rival FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) due to shipper uncertainty, Broughton said. UPS management “obviously concluded that they couldn’t let the bleeding continue,” he wrote. Broughton did not publish market share data in his note.ShipMatrix Inc., a consultancy with extensive data sets on parcel trends, said UPS lost about 5% of total U.S. average daily volume, almost entirely to FedEx, as shippers diverted traffic to FedEx. This amounted to about 1 million parcels per day, according to the firm’s estimates.In his note, Broughton said the volumes lost to FedEx will not return to UPS unless shippers experience service issues with FedEx.The post UPS can offset higher labor costs with modest rate hikes, analyst says appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

I'd now like to turn the call over to Lloyd.Story continuesLloyd M. YatesThanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our second quarter earnings release issued earlier today. I'll begin on Slide 6 to provide you with an update on our 3 key priorities. First, we are raising our 2023 non-GAAP NOEPS guidance the upper half of $1.54 to $1.60. We are also reaffirming our annual non-GAAP NOEPS growth of 6% to 8% through 2027, an annual rate base growth of 8% to 10%. Meanwhile, our non-tracked O&amp;M target is to remain flat in 2023 as well as throughout the duration of the plan. We continue building a track record of execution and growth, and our commitment to investors, employees and customers is central to everything we do. Recall our original 2023 NOEPS discrete guidance of $1.50 to $1.57 was introduced at our Investor Day in November. In February, we raised and narrowed our estimate to $1.54 to $1.60, and today, we are again raising to the upper half of this range. In the approximately 9 months since November, our superior operations, regulatory and financing execution have enabled this increase in earnings expectations. For our customers, commodity market conditions have been improving. However, inflation and interest rate headwinds continue to persist. Despite this, we remain focused on delivering value to our customers and highly visible, derisked financial results for our investors. Second, our leading regulatory execution continued this quarter in both the electric and gas businesses. May was a particularly busy month for our gas distribution business, as the Columbia Gas of Maryland filed a request with the Maryland Public Service Commission, seeking approval to adjust base rates. The request seeks to recover approximately $40 million of capital investment. Additionally, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved a settlement among Columbia Gas of Virginia and the parties in its base rate case originally filed in April 2022. The base rate adjustment approval authorizes recovery of approximately $390 million of capital investment. Columbia Gas of Ohio's infrastructure replacement program (inaudible) rates went into effect in May, initiating the recovery of $360 million of capital investment. At the electric business, the record is closed in the Northern Indiana Public Service company's electric rate case. We believe the settlement reached back in March represents a balanced outcome for stakeholders, as the company invests billions of dollars in our customers and communities in the state. A final order is anticipated today from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission with rates anticipated to be effective in steps by September 2023 and March 2024. At FERC, we received approval for incentives on 2 new MISO [MTEP] electric transmission projects last month, supporting our rate base investment and customer reliability beyond our current financial plan through 2027. Lastly, in June, we announced a definitive agreement to sell a minority stake in NIPSCO to Blackstone Infrastructure Partners. The transaction strengthens our balance sheet and financial flexibility marks yet another example of NiSource's steadfast execution for stakeholders. More importantly, it enables us to support ongoing investments in Indiana and our 1.3 million electric and gas customers in the state. Slide 7 details our annual capital expenditures across our 6-state service territory. In a 5-year period, through 2027, we plan to invest $15 billion in our customers and communities. At Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, we are currently replacing 21,000 feet of pipe in Fredericktown in Washington County. Nearly half of the small town's residents will have their service lines upgraded, with the remaining customers to be upgraded in the next 2 years. As part of this project, Columbia Gas is converting a low-income housing authority system from a master meter to individual meters, helping to lower the authorities' maintenance obligations. This $6 million project is part of the company's $110 million capital investment in Pennsylvania during the second quarter alone. NIPSCO remains committed to the gas (inaudible) plan to extend gas service into rural areas including [Steven], Allen and Lake Counties in Northern Indiana. Our major projects in local operating area teams have installed over 24 miles of rural gas main and installed 1,170 new services year-to-date through June as part of this plan. On the other side of our footprint, crews at Columbia Gas of Maryland are installing new pipe in the city of Cumberland to improve safety by abandoning 3 low-pressure regulator stations, along with abandoning a significant amount of bare steel pipe. This is part of an investment of nearly $8 million of total capital in the state during the second quarter. Turn to Slide 8. It shows key rate case in select capital rider activity since 2021. Our leading regulatory execution continues with no less than 9 cases filed in 7 jurisdictions across 6 states in the last 3 years. Our state regulatory teams are in a constant cycle of communication and engagement with key intervenors, regulators and customer groups. In addition to general rate cases, regular capital tracker filings allow timely recovery on and of our investments. All of this activity is built on a foundation of robust economic activity in our states. For example, at NIPSCO, the Northern Indiana [Meter] Transportation District provides vital transportation links to Chicago and Cook County, Illinois, and is constructing the double-track Northwest Indiana project. The project is anticipated to expand service, improve mobility and accessibility and stimulate job creation for Southern Lake County, and we are in the process of constructing substations to support this major transportation investment in the region. In Ohio, the new Intel chip factory has been under construction since mid-2022 in [Laking] County on the outskirts of Columbus. It is estimated to be a $20 billion investment in the state, and Intel will be a new Columbia Gas of Ohio customer. In Virginia, the Norfolk naval shipyard is the Navy's primary East Coast repair, overhaul and modernization facility, and 1 of the 4 public shipyards that play a critical role in maintaining America's fleet. The shipyard is installing a combined heat and power plant expected to be complete later this year that will significantly improve energy security and efficiency, with expected consumption of 1.7 million decatherms annually for Columbia Gas of Virginia. Customer count across our territories has been growing on average by 0.5% to 1% annually for years, including 2023 to date. Favorable demographic trends have driven inbound migration thanks to a stable and growing manufacturing base, robust utility and nonutility infrastructure and low tax rates in the states we serve. Turning to another foundational element of value for our 4 million customers, our internal teams continue to advance on all aspects of our operational excellence initiatives. Project Apollo has tracked, generating efficiencies by doing things safer, better, more efficiently and for less cost. One recent example is establishing standard buffer zones around our underground infrastructure to indicate areas where digging can safely occur, especially for third-party excavators. Before instituting a [standard] zone, (inaudible) of being called out to excavation sites to locate underground facilities when it wasn't needed. We've eliminated more than 10,000 unnecessary trips in the last 3 months, allowing more time to be spent on value-added work. Technology investments are also key to our operational excellence initiative. This year, we began our 5-year, approximately $1 billion transformation, with an initial $300 million investment in SAP and Salesforce technology platform implementation that will standardize work practices and drive efficiencies for our employees to improve service to our customers. All of this is expected to contribute to keeping total customer bill levels and live with inflation over the 5-year financial plan. These achievements would not be possible without our dedicated employees and their commitment to our customers, communities and all NiSource's stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael Luhrs.Michael LuhrsThank you, Lloyd. I'll begin on Slide 9. NIPSCO's generation transition is continuing to advance as we optimize the new portfolio to benefit customers and retire all coal-fired generation by the end of 2028. Crossroads and Dunns Bridge I solar project advanced to their [end of service stage] and are serving customers over the peak summer season. NIPSCO has now placed 4 utility-owned renewable investments into service from the 2018 integrated resource plan process. In total, these 4 projects represent approximately $800 million investment in 870 megawatts of economic, sustainable, 0 fuel cost, new generation for NIPSCO's Northern Indiana customers. Construction on Calgary Solar Plus Storage and Dunns Bridge II Solar Plus Storage continues. Both projects have expected in service dates in 2024, and we are in the very early stages of construction of the Fairbanks Solar project, which has been expected in service date of mid-2025. Additionally, our work on Indiana Crossroads 2 Wind PPA is advancing and is expected in service late this year. Today, we are announcing several adjustments to our remaining portfolio of projects [as they] address, development challenges and better align the portfolio with recent changes to MISO rules surrounding seasonal capacity constructs. The first is the conversion of the Gibson PPA project to a build transfer agreement. We have filed a CPCN seeking approval from the IURC, and if approved, this project will replace the Elliott project in our portfolio. Second, we have sought regulatory approval for several recently executed PPAs: Appleseed Solar, Templeton Wind. Finally, the agreement for the Elliott PPA and the Brickyard and Greensboro PPAs have been mutually terminated by NIPSCO and the developers of these projects. Four key points related to these projects. First, these economical and zero fuel cost resources continue to support customer affordability. Second, these changes support our current coal retirement schedule of all coal retired by the end of 2028. Third, the renewable generation in service by the end of 2025 will continue to consist of 8 build transfer agreements and 6 PPAs. And fourth, the revised portfolio progress is consistent with our current 5-year CapEx rate base financing and other prior commitments to the investment community. Beyond these projects, our 2021 IRP and 2022 RFP processes laid the groundwork for the balance of projects needed to replace the Michigan City generating station by 2028. NIPSCO is implementing an upgrade at the Sugar Creek gas generating station this year, and we are finalizing our analysis of gas [seeking] alternatives identified in our 2022 RFP, which we expect to result in a request for a new brownfield project at our Schahfer site. NIPSCO will continue to evaluate further generation portfolio needs, and we will be conducting the triannual integrated resource planning process with stakeholders in 2024.[Fewer] fuel cost resources reduced customer build volatility and create substantial value for our customers, especially as they experience elevated economy-wide inflation. Since our first project went commercial in late 2020, we have been passing back both excess generation and renewable energy credits revenue to customers from this and subsequent projects. In the second quarter alone, that amount totaled $8.4 million or over $2 per residential customer, for a year-to-date total of $14.6 million. As we look forward, Slide 10 shows additional CapEx opportunities not included in our financial plan through 2027. Multiple items on this list, both near term and longer term, are progressing well in their evaluation work streams. Prior to the Inflation Reduction Act, we beneficially employed tax equity financing on the 4 owned renewable projects in service to date, and our financial guidance incorporates tax equity financing for the remaining 4 projects in 2024 and 2025. However, given the new pathways for utilizing tax credits included in the IRA, we are evaluating the benefits of direct ownership for each of the remaining 4 build transfer projects, potentially adding incremental CapEx to the plan while enhancing the value for customers as well as portfolio and project flexibility. We are also working through our long-term investment plans stemming from the proposed rules around the 2020 Federal [Pipes] Act, which will require incremental investment in our system for various leak reduction, safety and other operational requirements. These requirements would build on the investments we have been making on our advanced leak detection and repair program. We will continue to be active in this area to support the best outcome for customers in terms of safety, emissions and infrastructure investment. These potential and current investments across our electric and gas businesses support our clean energy transition, furthering our Scope 1 emission reduction goals and enhancing customer value in a balanced way. At year-end 2022, NiSource achieved a 67% reduction in Scope 1 GHG emissions from 2005 baseline levels, and we remain on track to achieve an industry-leading 90% reduction in Scope 1 GHG emissions by 2030, and are advancing our goal of net 0 Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2040. At NiSource, we're very proud of our track record of decarbonization and focus on sustainability. In addition to being named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, we are rated as AAA by MSCI for ESG and have been recognized as 1 of America's Most Responsible Companies for 2023 by Newsweek, and by Ford's Best Employers for Diversity in 2023. Our passion is to create value for our customers and communities through investment in and operation of our electric and gas systems that drive customer benefits in reliability, safety, sustainability and customer offering. I'll now turn things over to Shawn.Shawn AndersonThank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone.Slide 11 reviews our financial results from the second quarter of this year. Non-GAAP net operating earnings achieved $50.3 million or $0.11 per share compared to $53.9 million or $0.12 per share in the second quarter of 2022. Year-to-date results continue to track in line with our plan. Visibility from constructive regulatory outcomes, completion of financing transactions and execution on O&amp;M initiatives have supported our raising our range to the upper half of the $1.54 to $1.60 range provided. As we indicated last quarter, key regulatory and O&amp;M drivers will continue to build value into our financial results for 2023 as they layer into our actual results across the full year and drive greater impact in the second half of the fiscal year. Turning to Slide 12, you'll find segment detail and key drivers of our 2Q results. Gas Distribution operating earnings were $120 million in the second quarter, an increase of $39 million versus the same quarter last year. New rates and capital investment programs drove $61 million of incremental revenue, including general rate case contributions in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Virginia and Maryland. Capital trackers in Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia positively impacted the segment as well. Non-tracked gas O&amp;M was flat year-over-year. In the Electric segment, operating earnings were $51 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $22 million versus the same quarter last year. Lower weather-normalized customer usage across all 3 customer classes attributes to this variance and is related to industrial outages and a return to more normal long-term demand in the commercial and residential segments. Higher nontracked O&amp;M was also a headwind, primarily due to the timing of generation maintenance expenses and increased reliability spend related to vegetation management. And finally, Corporate and Other was favorable by $14 million due primarily to lower benefit and insurance costs and reduced third-party expenditures. Now I'd like to briefly touch on our debt and credit profile on Slide 13. Our debt level as of June 30, 2023 was $12.6 billion, of which $11 billion was long-term debt with a weighted average maturity of 12 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%. At the end of the second quarter, we maintained net available liquidity of $1.8 billion, consisting of cash and available capacity under our credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization programs. We remain committed to our current investment-grade credit ratings. I'm happy to share all 3 agencies have reaffirmed NiSource ratings with stable outlooks following their annual reviews and the minority interest announcement. Slide 14 addresses our financing strategy and credit commitments. In June, we issued $450 million of 10-year notes at 5.4% and an additional $300 million of our March 5-year, 5.25% notes. We plan to use a portion of these proceeds from the sale of the notes to fund our capital plan. As previously indicated, we also plan on completing the equity units transaction launched in 2021 by remarketing the units this fall. We are reaffirming our long-term financing plan originally disclosed at Investor Day in November. This includes 0 discrete equity issuances through 2027 and 0 ATM equity in 2023 and 2024, and all financing costs are reflected in our earnings growth and credit commitments. This balanced financing plan is anticipated to help us deliver on our 14% to 16% annual FFO debt ratio anticipated for all years of the plan when considering the proceeds of the minority sale. This affords us adequate flexibility to execute on rate base investment opportunities as they arise in any given year. Central to our financing plan is the sale of a minority stake in NIPSCO. The transaction enables billions of dollars of investment for our customers and communities planned in Indiana over the coming years. It also strengthens our balance sheet and enhances flexibility and diversification from traditional capital markets. Our transaction announcement in June followed a period of capital market headwinds for utilities. Interest rates are generally higher, and utility equity valuations are flat or down as a group since we originally stated our intention to sell the interest in November. We believe our decision to pursue this financing transaction optimized and derisked our cost of capital versus alternative paths. We are very optimistic about the growing strength of our balance sheet and credit metrics as we look ahead. Supportive rate structures and regulatory activity, coupled with the proceeds coming in later this year from the minority sale and the remarketing of our equity units, position us strongly in the 14% to 16% FFO to debt range. Later this year, we expect to provide an update and roll forward of our long-term financial commitments. This will enable us to complete our annual planning period and refresh of all of our capital expenditure and regulatory plans as we look forward to 2024 and the outer years of our financial forecast. Both at NIPSCO and our Columbia Gas operating companies, our customers are core to everything we do. We remain sensitive to the overall inflationary pressures impacting many parts of consumer expenses, even as falling energy commodity prices have helped our customer bills in the first half of this year. Our fuel cost adjustment mechanisms update every quarter, and therefore, quickly begin to pass back savings as prices fall. These have been a critical tool to help our customers during the extreme swings in commodity prices seen over the last 2 years. Second quarter gas fuel charges on residential customer bills declined $31 million versus the second quarter of 2022. This has translated into an average decline of $6.50 per month for the commodity portion of customer bills across our gas utility businesses. Weather normalization mechanisms also insulate both investors and customers across the (inaudible) portion of our meters. Residential customers across our Columbia Gas companies benefit from constructs ranging from full straight fixed variable rate design in Ohio to a normalization band in Pennsylvania utilized during heating season, among other mechanisms. The impact of weather is excluded from our adjusted EPS, however, it's worth noting the actual cash flow impact versus normal in 2Q and year-to-date was only $6 million and $38 million pretax, respectively, or 1% and 3% of our cash flow from operations for those periods. Scale is another factor we believe can drive greater affordability for our customers. The scale of NiSource's 6 operating companies and its central services operating model supports approximately 4 million customers, and presents opportunities to flatten our operations and maintenance expenditures. And as we grow our customer base across all of our companies, those costs can be shared across the broader base. This also benefits our investors as scale and diversity enable traditional rate base investment flexibility across multiple jurisdictions and multiple energy systems. Finally, I'd like to conclude where Lloyd started today. We are reiterating our long-term annual non-GAAP NOEPS growth commitment of 6% to 8% through 2027, driven by annual rate base growth of 8% to 10%. We are raising 2023 non-GAAP NOEPS guidance to the upper half of the $1.54 to $1.60 range. This follows our guidance range raising and narrowing in February from our original 2023 guidance range offered last November. This further demonstrates our growing track record of execution, including exceeding our $1.44 to $1.46 guidance range in 2022 with actual NOEPS of $1.47 and exceeding our $1.32 to $1.36 guidance range in 2021 while achieving $1.37. We remain confident in our plan despite persistent inflationary supply chain and interest rate headwinds. We continue building a track record of execution and growth, and our commitment to our investors, employees and customers is central to everything we do. Thank you for your support of NiSource. And with that, I'll turn things over to Lloyd for final comments.Lloyd M. YatesThanks, Shawn. And before we take questions, I'd like to share some late-breaking news with the investor community. We just received an order from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for the NIPSCO electric rate case. And upon the initial review, it appears the settlement in the NIPSCO's case has been approved without modification. The team is reviewing the details of the order, and if we see anything different, we'll let you know as soon as possible. And just let me give you a couple of highlights. A revenue increase of $292 million, return on equity of 9.8% and an increase -- rate base increase of slightly over $1.8 billion. I want to publicly thank the IURC for their diligence in review of this quarter, the team and all the stakeholders that contribute to what we believe is a very balanced solution. And with that, we'll open the floor for questions. Thank you.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.Shahriar PourrezaJust -- Lloyd, it's good to see that you guys actually increased your guidance for the year when peers lowered, obviously, this morning. Could we get maybe just share a little bit of what's driving the level of confidence '23, especially with how the key part of the year is still in front of us? And whether there's anything to read into there as we're thinking about the 6% to 8% growth rate?Lloyd M. YatesSo I'll let Shawn handle the details. But when you think about the second half of the year, I think the thing to contemplate is all of the great regulatory execution we had, including the [order] from Indiana today, and continue to drive savings by Apollo. And with that, I'll turn it over to Shawn for details of that comment. Shawn?Shawn AndersonYes. Thanks, Lloyd. Appreciate the question. Just as Lloyd said, you may observe the track record of success on Slide 8, which demonstrates consistent execution of rate case and (inaudible) filings across all of our businesses. Most notably, if you bring your attention to Q4 2022 and all of the 2023 outcomes, that specifically gives us enhanced line of sight to regulated revenue drivers across the balance of this year. That's somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.35 per share in total regulatory programs over the second half, which have already been approved or implemented and which will support growth revenues in the second half of the year. Obviously, we've had some successful execution of financing transactions required to execute the robust capital expenditure program in 2023. Those really have concluded our long-term debt issuances for the year, thus we've got a good line of sight to the interest expense that we're going to be paying for the rest of this year to support capital programs. Lloyd mentioned Project Apollo. We're definitely seeing some success as those programs are starting to launch here in the middle of this year. That will give us some tailwinds on the O&amp;M front that we can use to enhance performance. But the other piece I'd note, just simply, we remain confident in the 6% to 8% annual OEPS growth rate through 2027. And again, I'll just take this moment as an opportunity to remind folks, we project that growth rate off of year-end results for each year of the plan. So while we're now targeting the upper half of the current year guidance range, this flows through into the annual 68% NOEPS across the remainder of the plan period.Shahriar PourrezaOkay. Terrific. That's what I was trying to sort of get at. Okay, good. And then the near-term CapEx slide, I think it [was] Slide 10, that could be incremental. I mean, can you just sort of help us size that for us? Even a range and the timing and how we should think about when that could actually hit the plan? Is EEI maybe the right podium to update? Is it year-end results? Like -- how do we think about when we can get additional disclosures there?Shawn AndersonYes. Maybe I'll start, and then I'll pass things to Michael to touch on a couple of components that might be interesting in there. But we plan to update all the long-term commitments, including growth rate, capital expenditures in that November time frame. So I think you hit the nail on the head. We'll look at all factors and provide as much visibility as we can into our business. As you know, we've got a backlog of identified and high-quality investment opportunities which support system reliability, sustainability, customer service, and our focus is really how can we efficiently access those investments at 1x rate base and convert that into NOEPS for our shareholders. The teams are studying that right now. We're going through that annual planning process. The results of that, we'll be able to share in the November time frame. But Michael, do you want to hit any interesting ideas on that slide?Michael LuhrsThe only thing that I'll add to that, Shawn, is we continue to work through the different elements of it. They are progressing well in the work streams of those items, but also in more real terms. When we think about the '22 RFP and the work on that as we finalize it and as we mentioned before, that's going to come back relative to a potential brownfield associated with the [Shafer] site. We already mentioned the 2021 IRP relative to the potential for a new gas [peaker]. And in addition to that, we continue to evaluate the remaining options in the portfolio that would allow us to meet the commitments that we set associated with the generation transition.Shahriar PourrezaOkay. Got it. And then just lastly for me, Lloyd, maybe just a strategic question, if I may. I mean obviously, you guys executed a fantastic transaction with NIPSCO, so that was good. But I know obviously, some of the local media and some of the banker regs are highlighting maybe NiSource's acquisitive nature as you're thinking about potential deals. Without obviously going into specifics, unless you want to go into specifics, I guess, can you just highlight what your appetite is to grow the business further especially in states that you already operate in?Lloyd M. YatesSo that was really a good way to ask that question, Shar. Let me start there. And I don't want to comment on specific details. Of course, like most companies, our policies, we don't comment on market room, of course, specific details. What I will comment on though is back in November on Investor Day, we laid out what I thought, and I think this team and our Board thinks, is a really, really good plan. We're going to grow our earnings 6% to 8% annually off end of year results, 8% to 10% rate base growth. We put forth a transaction, [it's got a] 19.9% of the NIPSCO utility to strengthen our balance sheet. And what I will tell you is as we did the business review last year, that was the only transaction we contemplated, and we are laser-focused on getting that done. So you mentioned we haven't finished that transaction yet. That transaction is [goaled] to be finished by the end of this year. We're laser focused on that transaction, investing $15 billion of capital, making sure we operate in an excellent way and growing earnings, and that is where the whole NiSource team is zeroing down on.Shahriar PourrezaOkay. Great. I'm sure someone asked that question in a different way. Appreciate it, guys.Lloyd M. YatesYours was good.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan.Richard Wallace SunderlandAm I coming through clearly?Lloyd M. YatesYes, you are.Richard Wallace SunderlandGreat. Circling back to the renewables project changes outlined in 1 of the earlier slides there, could you give a little bit more color to the backdrop and process underpinning all of that? I mean, it seems like it worked out in a way effectively neutral to you on ownership versus PPA basis. But just curious if there's anything more you can highlight out of how those changes contemplated became about?Michael LuhrsSure. Happy to do so. Thank you. When we look at it, just to reinforce, I mean we will continue to consist of 8 build transfer agreements and 6 PPAs, and the revised portfolio project is consistent with our current 5-year CapEx rate base financing other prior commitments. But to get a little bit more into your question, we're consistently looking through the portfolio and making sure that we're eliminating risk associated with delivery and providing the best options for customer costs associated with those projects, so we're always looking to optimize them. So as we go through site development and different activities with it, we looked at how to best optimize that portfolio, and that's what you're seeing being done here. So by doing these projects and the way we've set them up, it gives us a lot of confidence in being able to execute on those plans and deliver those commitments as well as being able to provide the customers the benefits and meet MISO changes as well in the (inaudible).Richard Wallace SunderlandUnderstood. Understood. Very helpful there. And sticking with renewables, but thinking about that Slide 10 with the additional investment opportunities, the ownership uplift asset is under evaluation. Is that an item we expect to have resolved or mapped out in time for the fall update? And anything else that you could point out from the list as a likely candidate for at least an update in that fall outlook provision?Michael LuhrsSo I would say as we go through the projects and as we continue to provide information with IRC and other parties, we will provide updates to those projects as we go through each stage, just like we did with Gibson and the filing associated with that. But relative to the full ownership, we're finishing our evaluation of the IRA. And as mentioned before, there are significant benefits with the IRA both in tax policy and the ability to maintain the full ownership, which benefits project and portfolio optimization. This gives the capability to remove administrative burden, complexity as well as to optimize the asset, and we're finishing that analysis now and expect to be able to conclude that. But in doing so, if we look at that right now, our plan assumes tax equity for the remaining 4 projects. If we -- pending regulatory approval, if all 4 were included under full ownership, that would require up to $1 billion in additional CapEx.Richard Wallace SunderlandUnderstood. So to be clear, that's $1 billion incremental to the current placeholder under a full ownership scenario. Is that what you're saying?Michael LuhrsYes. So when you look at the current plan, the current plan assumes tax equity if full ownership was done for all 4 projects. Pending any regulatory approvals, it would be up to $1 billion in additional CapEx.Richard Wallace SunderlandGot it. Got it. And one final quick one for me. Just Project Apollo, as you get further along in the kind of the initial launch here, any new learnings relative to what you laid out in the spring around this initiative? Or anything to highlight in terms of what you're seeing for employees and other stakeholders as you roll this out?Lloyd M. YatesYes, so thanks for asking that question. I think what we're seeing is employees getting excited and finding better and more ideas for cost savings. I think when you drill down into the organization, employees know what holds them up and getting more work done, and we're getting after it. I think this will be a continuous improvement mindset. We're driving it throughout the company to do things safer, better, faster and more efficiently. But again, this is an employee-driven ideas. It's process driven and we're finding significant savings, and I expect this to continue on for a really long time. In fact, I expect it to start accelerating in 2024 and beyond. But delivering the savings now, looking forward acceleration process next year for even more savings.Richard Wallace SunderlandGreat to hear, and thanks for the time today.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.Steven Isaac FleishmanJust -- I apologize -- Yes, Lloyd. Just -- apologize to repeat this, but just could you maybe go through the changes in the renewables program from the prior program? Again, just kind of what has actually changed in terms of adjustments and cancellations?Lloyd M. YatesMichael?Michael LuhrsSure. Happy to do so. So when you look at it, [Elliott] was originally included as the [BTA] that is being replaced by Gibson, assuming approved by the IURC that was filed. In addition to that, we terminated several PPAs and also added several PPAs, which have been filed with the IURC. So you look at Templeton Wind, Carpenter Wind, Appleseed Solar are all filed with IURC now, and those are really the fundamental changes. So we had 8 BTAs before. We have 8 BTAs now, it's just Elliott to Gibson. And we have 6 PPAs before, we have 6 PPAs now. And it's Templeton and Carpenter Wind and Appleseed Solar in those versus like Brickyard and Greensboro and Gibson. Those were terminated.Steven Isaac FleishmanAnd the 3 new PPA?Shawn AndersonSorry. Just real quick. The only thing I'd add would be with those changes, the NIPSCO investment forecast of $2 billion to $2.2 billion is unchanged, yes.Steven Isaac FleishmanGot it. And the new PPAs, have you announced who they're with?Lloyd M. YatesWe've done the filings associated with them, and in those filings, I believe that we have said who they are with.Steven Isaac FleishmanOkay. Do you have that just off top of your head, or?Michael LuhrsWe'll get back to you on that.Lloyd M. YatesYes. [Randy] will get back to you with those names.Steven Isaac FleishmanOkay. Overall, the message is same CapEx program, same amount of PPAs, remixing everything. And then obviously, there's this upside opportunity if you're able to use -- not have to use tax equity in terms of (inaudible). Okay.Michael LuhrsThat's correct.Steven Isaac FleishmanOkay. And then just the overall IURC support of the program remains strong, like the how much of these are the (inaudible)? Yes.Lloyd M. YatesThe IURC, I think the State of Indiana in general, there's very good support for this renewables program. And I think what drove it, the amount of stakeholder engagement that got done upfront, I think what we're seeing is the benefit of stakeholder engagement with the IURC, the industrial customers, the commercial customers, the legislators. And I think it's been settlement, rate case approval, filings. So we believe and we continue -- not believe, we know we have very good support from the IURC in the state of Indiana, and we think that we're doing this transition in a way that really makes sense from a clean energy perspective and a reliability perspective.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithLook, just wanted to follow up on a few of the last tidbits you guys put out there just on the generation upside you talked about a moment ago. Just want to clarify this. First off, you've seen incremental load across your service territories. To what extent does that $1 billion upside contemplate that angle as well as any potential shift here in MISO capacity needs? And then in turn, just on the tax equity bit, can you clarify just the status with the credit rating agencies? I know there's been some conversation on that front amongst others out there. If you can update us on that front?Shawn AndersonYes. The first piece of the question, Julien, and this is Shawn. The first piece of the question, the incremental load that you're alluding to is not captured in the $1 billion. Said differently, the 2021 IRP projected capacity requirements and the load necessary for us to serve our communities, and it provided that with the existing footprint of assets that we're currently engaged commercially to construct. Incremental load would be captured in the next IRP and factored into any future generation planning. That next IRP would be 2024, so we would capture that upside as we rerun the scenarios around load factors next year. And then the second part of your question, we expect that for purposes of calculating FFO, the treatment of tax credit transfers would be consistent with GAAP accounting. That should result in tax credit transfers flowing through the tax line and increasing FFO, and we understand that our credit rating agencies are evaluating that. But that methodology consistent with GAAP accounting seems to track with us, and we'll continue to stay engaged with the credit rating agencies as they continue their evaluation.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithGot it. Excellent. And then, Lloyd, just to come back and open that can again, if we can. Just on the strategic front here, I mean, obviously, the plan is very good as is. Any commentary as to thresholds that you would think to? I mean, obviously, you laid out a pretty stark 1 earlier. Any further commentary on that front? I mean, obviously, you've got a very nice running start here on the [plant].Lloyd M. YatesRight. So we're -- I mean, we're investing $15 billion of capital at 1x rate base. Someone wants to sell us an asset that creates significant shareholder value at less than that, I think the probability of that is really low, but our focus is our plan.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithAwesome. All right. Sorry, I'll leave that be. Good luck, guys.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.Durgesh ChopraI just wanted to go back and clarify the tax equity to the $1 billion CapEx upside. So if I follow this correctly, the 8 BATs that you have currently in the plan, there is tax equity in it. And there's a potential with the IRA that tax equity results in $1 billion more CapEx or [rate pays] upside of those -- within those 8 projects. Am I thinking about this correctly?Michael LuhrsIt would be for the remaining 4 projects of the 8. All 8 projects right now in the plan assume tax equity. So it would be for the remaining 4 projects, Cavalry Solar and Storage, Dunns Bridge II Solar and Storage, Fairbanks and Gibson, pending regulatory approval associated with those that if those projects were under full ownership, it would be up to an incremental $1 billion in CapEx. And the only thing I'd want to add to that is when we look at them, obviously, from the customer side and the benefits, we're making sure that we do full due diligence on that. And to follow up on the previous question just to make sure I got the mix right, it is next era for Templeton and Appleseed, and Carpenter is EDPR.Durgesh ChopraGot it. Okay. So remaining 4. That makes a lot of sense.And maybe just can you -- Shawn, maybe this is -- maybe you can answer this one, but just -- how should we think about financing of that incremental CapEx? I think at the Investor Day, right, what you laid out was ATM in 2025 and beyond which was 15% equity, 85% debt on growth opportunities. Is that a good rule of thumb still as we think about this incremental $1 billion CapEx? That's part 1 of the question. And part 2, do you see like depending on the time frame of these projects or potential equity or ATM next year and before the 2025 time frame?Shawn AndersonAppreciate the question. So at this point, there's no change to the financing plan we shared at our Investor Day in November. So just to reiterate, this includes no new equity until 2025, no discrete equity issuances to the life of the plan, with ATM maintenance equity beginning towards the latter half of the planned horizon. As we complete the equity units for marketing transaction that we entered into 2021, we'll receive some additional proceeds there. As you know, we received proceeds when we close the transaction with Blackstone. That will provide us a credit cushion relative to the 14% to 16% FFO to debt. We'll be in the 14% to 16% FFO to debt range, but a credit cushion that we could use to apply towards CapEx in 2024 should we need to and should we identify incremental cap opportunities. What we're currently doing right now is evaluating what those capital opportunities could look like, inclusive of tax equity and how that will create incremental cash flow as you'd expect coming out of our business, and then how that would impact our financing plan throughout the entire horizon. All of that, we expect to be able to step through in the November time frame so it's a bit too early to tell you exactly how that works. But the financing plan itself and the commitments we've made are still consistent with what we made in Investor Day.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi.Ryan Michael LevineI appreciate all the details on solar, I guess a couple of follow-ups. What drove the changes for your project portfolio that you outlined? And why make these changes now?Michael LuhrsWell, as we go through the projects and we work through just the normal process of developing the projects and develop -- negotiating the agreements, we're always looking as to how to make sure that we're eliminating risk and bringing in the benefits. So on these individual projects, you combine that with also how we're able to provide the best benefit to customers, and that's what fundamentally led to the changes associated with the projects. That had to do with subcomponents associated with whether it be development costs or certain costs associated with the each individual site, and we try to maintain a robust portfolio of development opportunities that enable us to have that flexibility associated with it. We know no plan goes exactly as planned, so therefore, we want to have flexibility in that plan. And really, it's just working through that normal process of project development, construction siting, et cetera.Ryan Michael LevineAnd then what's the time line or milestones you're working on that have a better sense of the [FEMSA] related transmission investment opportunity? And when do you think you'll have a better -- some numbers to point to around that uptake?Michael LuhrsI'm sorry, can you repeat that? For which opportunity?Ryan Michael LevineFor the [FEMSA] CapEx upside that you identified in your slide?Michael LuhrsYes. So we're continuing to do the analysis associated with the [FEMSA]. We know that looking at it that there would be significant additional requirements. We have not laid out a specific timeline associated with those activities yet or what that would mean relative to our CapEx or financial plans. But the team is well engaged, well underway and working through those as well as we're engaged on how those rules are promulgated and what -- and how we can best benefit customers.Ryan Michael LevineThink you'll be able to have a plan in next year? Or is this a this year decision point? Or any color you can share around timeline?Lloyd M. YatesI think we're working through that process in November. Whether it be an EEI or via our earnings call, we'll have those plans more formalized and laid out. We'll get them to you as soon as we have them.Operator(Operator Instructions) Your next question is from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.Travis MillerJust at a high level, if you go back to November and think about the outlook you gave for this year and then forward to today, what's been the biggest surprise? Now you mentioned a couple of different variables. But what's the big surprise that has come about this year that is leading to that higher earnings outlook?Lloyd M. YatesSo I would say to you, as I sit in the seat, a little over 1.5 years, more confidence in our ability to execute on the regulatory front. I think that we have just really superior regulatory execution capabilities. As I spend more time on the operating side and look at the cost savings on here,and savings without taking additional risk but really becoming better operational excellence. I'm seeing a lot more momentum gains, so -- and I have confidence in this management team. And we've put this management team in place, we're really working well together. They're probably 1 of the best management teams in the industry, and it's working really well so it's given us more confidence to deliver our earnings to investors. I think we're doing better on the customer side and better in our communities, and our employees like working here better. So I think it's an overall confidence rising across all of NiSource.Travis MillerOkay. That's great. And then on the renewable energy and coal retirements, with what you have in the pipeline right now regardless of whether it's PPA or ownership, how much more in your projections are you looking at to be able to execute that full coal retirement, whether it's renewables or some other type of capacity? How much more outside of what you've announced is necessary, do you think?Michael LuhrsSo we haven't completed the work associated with that. As we mentioned, there's additional CapEx included in the placeholder in the plan. We have significant work done from the 2022 RFP associated with that, which is concluding. But beyond that initial work, we will continue to look at opportunities around a diverse mix of assets that fill that $1 billion of CapEx, which is what we have targeted relative to the retirement of the 2028 (inaudible). So work is continuing. We'll have more updates as we go through the next Q, and we're continuing to work the '22 RFP associated with it to finalize that.Travis MillerOkay. great. I appreciate it. That's all I had.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.]"

473,20c2d85b-703e-378d-b530-92e54e62613c,NI,2023-08-03,NEWLY APPROVED NIPSCO ELECTRIC RATES TAKE EFFECT BEGINNING IN AUGUST,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newly-approved-nipsco-electric-rates-171500239.html,1690996500,STORY,"['NI', 'NI-PB', 'NIMC']","[Balanced outcome supports safe operations, infrastructure improvements, sustainability and enhanced customer experienceMERRILLVILLE, Ind., Aug. 2, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Northern Indiana Public Service Company LLC (NIPSCO) received a decision from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) to adjust its electric rates, effective August 2023. The newly approved rates will be phased in over a multi-step process to spread out the changes to customer bills beginning in August 2023, with the remaining changes applied in 2024.""Customers expect safe, dependable electric service at the lowest cost possible,"" said Mike Hooper, NIPSCO president. ""This decision balances new rates in a way that allows NIPSCO to continue making the necessary investments in our infrastructure and technology to serve customers. Meanwhile, this outcome also supports safety, reliability and sustainability, with a significant portion of the investments tied to our energy transition and the addition of new renewable energy projects located in Indiana – which are already providing direct economic benefits to our customers and communities.""NIPSCO is transitioning to a more balanced energy portfolio. The transition includes renewable energy sources – which are operational and serving customers well – representing more than $800 million in new investments through 2023. In turn, customers benefit by receiving all of the revenue when excess power is generated and sold into the market. Since 2021, more than $60 million in credits has gone back to customers associated with excess power and renewable energy credit sales from the company's new renewable and existing generating units. The newly approved rates also support the company's investment of approximately $700 million in electric transmission and distribution system upgrades, technology improvements, and safety and reliability initiatives to be completed by the end of 2023, with plans for similar investments into the future.Story continuesHow will residential customer bills change?  As a regulated energy provider, NIPSCO cannot change any rates or charges to its customers without the approval of the IURC. NIPSCO's natural gas rates are not affected by this request.The IURC decision follows a nearly year-long, extensive review process including public input and collaborative agreement reached with the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) and the NIPSCO Industrial Group.Based on a review of the IURC's decision, the average residential electric customer using 668 kilowatt hours (kwh) per month will see an overall increase of approximately $12 per month (or 10 percent), with the change being phased in over multiple steps beginning in August 2023 and into 2024. This change is lower than the initial proposed monthly increase of approximately $19 per month, or 16.5 percent. As the company retires its remaining coal-fired generation by 2028, the costs associated with operating and maintaining those facilities will be reduced and eventually eliminated. Included in today's decision is a component that ensures customers are only paying costs as NIPSCO incurs them, providing a more real-time benefit to customers.Actual projected bill impacts may vary by customer – including non-residential customers – depending on usage and future potential changes in market prices for commodities like coal.Additional Customer Benefits: There are other customer benefits associated with this change, including:Continued investments to protect the electric grid against cybersecurity threatsA broad range of system upgrades to increase reliabilityModernization of the electric grid with automated technology that pinpoints problems and allows us to make repairs more efficientlyEnhanced overall customer experience through the introduction of new products and services. Examples of recent enhancements include a mobile app, along with the ability for customers to connect with customer care agents online via live or automated chat, the continuation of energy efficiency programs and moreNIPSCO funding assistance to Community Action Programs to enable health and safety work for the low-income weatherization program.Bill payment assistance and energy savings programs are available  As the current economic effects of inflation and other rising costs are being experienced, it's important to know that help continues to be available. Bill payment assistance programs are available for customers experiencing financial difficulties – including those who are most vulnerable.Beyond the existing state and federal energy assistance programs and moratorium on winter service disconnections, NIPSCO provides, credit arrangements, budget plans and reduced deposits for eligible customers, including:Payment Agreements: NIPSCO has expanded its payment plan agreements to offer its most flexible payment plans to customers that need financial support, including three-, six- and 12-month plans.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for NiSource: favorable.

(NYSE:ZBH) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript August 1, 2023Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $1.82, expectations were $1.81.Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Zimmer Biomet Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Chief Communications and Administration Officer. Please go ahead.Keri Mattox: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Bryan Hanson, our Chairman, President and CEO; and EVP and CFO, Suky Upadhyay; and COO, Ivan Tornos. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties and in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q2 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?Bryan Hanson: All right. Thanks, Keri, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this morning. It's always good to be with you. But I would say it's even a little better and certainly more fun when we have great performance in the quarter. So we're pretty happy about the results that we get to discuss today, and I can tell you, we're looking forward to the dialogue. And I'll start things up, as we normally do, I'll talk about our Q2 performance and the key drivers inside of the quarter. But I think also really important is to talk about the key drivers that we see continuing to move this business forward. And then Suky will walk us through the financial details of the quarter and importantly, discuss how we are again raising our full year financial guidance.Story continuesAnd then, of course, we'll close things out with a Q&amp;A session, and we look forward to answering your questions and having a dialogue in that session. Okay. To kick things off, I'm just going to take a step back, which I've been doing now for the last handful of quarters and I think deservedly so, because I want to say thank you. I want to say thank you to each and every one of our team members around the world because it's your hard work, it's your dedication to getting the job done that is moving this business forward. And I will tell you that I'm proud to say that you have delivered another very strong quarter, while once again making ZB a certified Great Place to Work. And you've done all of this while improving our scores and as a result of that, our rankings on the environmental, social and governance front.So I think simply stated, we are doing well, while also doing good. And that means for our team members, our patients, our customers and our communities and even our planet. So once again, I want to say thank you to our team for all that you do for ZB and to move our mission forward. And most importantly, for doing it together as one team, one ZB team. Now let's talk about the second quarter. And I'm just going to say simply, we delivered another strong quarter, again beating our own expectations. And that performance positions us to again raise our financial guidance on both the top and bottom line. And this is in the face of some pretty significant macro factors that are impacting us in the entire market. Ongoing supply challenges are very real, and I'll talk about those in a minute, but also inflationary pressure, a tough labor market and the geopolitical landscape that is putting pressure on everybody.But against that, I feel very confident about our pipeline, our execution and the team's demonstrated ability to navigate these headwinds, which gives us confidence to increase our financial outlook. Okay. With that said, let's talk about the key drivers inside of Q2, and there were some positives and there were some negatives. I'll start with the positives, and the most important one, in my view, is that our team's execution remains flawless. We're seeing significant traction, probably the best we've ever seen with our new product innovation. And that paid dividends in the quarter for sure, but most importantly, is it pays dividends as we move this business forward. And I would say that procedure recovery continued in the quarter, again showing no meaningful impact from COVID or staffing challenges, and that allowed for a tailwind from increased provider capacity, and that resulted in backlog pull-through in the quarter.In terms of headwinds, I would say that the team is doing a great job of managing the supply-constrained environment. But I would say that it is still very clearly a governor to our overall growth in the quarter, and it continues to be a distraction for the organization. See if I combine these things, though, all in all, our momentum continues, and it continues to grow. And I've said before, my confidence in this business, our confidence in this business is as high as it's ever been. And it's high for a good reason. If you just look at the knee franchise alone, our innovation strategy is working. We now have 4 meaningful pillars inside of this business. All of which can drive pricing stability, mix benefit and competitive conversions. First, let's look at the ROSA Robotic Platform combined with our Persona cementless Knee.Now this is a powerhouse combination that is and will continue to accelerate growth. And based on the traction we're seeing so far, we continue to believe that ROSA and Persona cementless together will enhance our robotics and cementless penetration from the current mid-teen level to 50% or better, 5-0% or better. The second pillar that we're focused on is Persona revision. This provides a meaningful conversion and mix opportunities inside the revision category. But importantly, it also acts as a powerful tip-of-the-spear product for conversions and primary needs. And then third, it's just the overall shift of the ZB legacy knee systems to our now fully rounded out Persona portfolio. And this is a meaningful mix benefit that we can take advantage of that, I would say, is somewhat unique to our business.And then fourth, on top of all this, we have the world's first and only Smart Knee which is Persona iQ. And I know this is still in limited launch, but already, it offers surgeons unparalleled data access and is attractive to patients, those patients who want more direct engagement with their care recovery. And we're taking on a similar approach to our hip portfolio where we continue to launch meaningful innovation, again, giving us the opportunity for price stability, mix benefit and competitive conversions. And we have 4 pillars of focus here as well. First, it's ROSA and Hip Insight. These are technology shifts in robotics and mixed reality that are setting up the ZB Hip portfolio for greater adoption and growth. Second is the Avenir Complete.This is our current flagship product combined with G7, which gives us a very strong position in both the attractive direct anterior and revision submarkets of hip. And then third, this position will be enhanced with work being done on a triple taper stem which will fully round out our direct interior approach portfolio. We believe this new portfolio, combined with the G7, which is the most versatile acetabular component available will be unmatched in the industry. And then fourth, HAMR. This is our upcoming full launch of an automated impaction system that builds on a proven need in the market, and we fully expect that this launch will create surgical efficiencies while bringing personalized precision to each and every patient. And then finally, in S.E.T., we are being disciplined and targeting investment in our growth driver categories, Upper extremities, Sports and CMFT, and each of these categories continue to perform.And given our momentum in these businesses and continued investment in innovation and dedicated infrastructure, we fully expect the S.E.T. set business to be a mid-single-digit grower in a normalized market environment. So overall, we're very excited about our innovation momentum. It's very real. Remember, we've called out that we have 40 planned product launches between this year and the end of 2025. With the majority in 4%-plus growth markets. And that's important because these innovations will certainly drive near-term growth. There's no question about that, but also create better sustainability of that growth because of the markets they're in. This portfolio shift that we're seeing and the team's execution capabilities are clear signs that our ZB transformation has taken hold.But I can tell you right now that we're not going to stop there. The goal is to continue to enhance our growth profile through our ongoing focus on active portfolio management, and that is supported by our already strong and strengthening balance sheet. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Suky for a closer look at Q2 and our latest expectations for the remainder of 2023. Okay, Suky?Medical devices, medical equipmentCopyright: nimon / 123RF Stock PhotoSuketu Upadhyay: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Bryan noted, we had another excellent quarter. Our results were driven by strong end markets as well as strong execution across the entire organization. As a result, we are again increasing our full year financial outlook. With that, let's turn to our results and updated full year guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the second quarter and how it compares to the same period in 2022. And my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis. Net sales were $1.870 billion, an increase of 4.9% on a reported basis and an increase of 6%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, we had a selling day headwind of less than 50 basis points in the quarter.Overall, the business continues to benefit from a recovery of elective procedures driven by continued market normalization, including hospital staffing and procedure cancellations returning to pre-COVID levels. We also benefited from some backlog recapture. While market momentum is strong, we continue to face certain macro challenges, including global supply chain pressures that muted performance across the business. U.S. growth of 5% continued to outpace our expectations and international growth of 7.2% was driven by strong performance in both EMEA as well as Asia Pacific. All regions benefited from continued recovery of elective procedures, backlog recapture as well as strong commercial execution and new product uptake. Turning to our business category performance.Global Knees grew 10.5% with U.S. growing 9.8% and international growing 11.4%. The strong performance in Knees was driven by the 4 pillars that Bryan mentioned earlier, centering on a very attractive Persona portfolio, combined with the benefits of our ROSA robotics platform. Global Hips grew 4.9% with U.S. Hips up 2.7% and international up 7.1%. Both regions posted good growth on the back of new product flow, execution and market recovery. Next, the S.E.T. category was down 30 basis points year-over-year. Inside of that, we saw continued strong performance from our 3 focus areas within the business segment. As expected, we saw pressure from reimbursement headwinds within the Restorative Therapies business. In addition, we experienced more acute supply challenges within Sports and Trauma.In the backdrop of this, we believe we will move beyond these headwinds, and this segment will rebound in the second half of the year. Finally, our Other category grew 6.5%. Now moving on to the P&amp;L. In Q2, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.73 in the prior year. The increase was driven by higher revenues combined with lower nonoperating expenses due to ZimVie investment losses from the prior year that did not repeat as well as lower spend related to restructuring costs. These benefits were partially offset by increased investment in R&amp;D and commercial initiatives to drive future growth. On an adjusted basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.82 were flat to the prior year.Higher year-over-year revenues and better gross margins were offset by higher R&amp;D expenses, increased investments into commercial infrastructure for new product launches and higher interest expense. Our adjusted gross margin was 72%, up 40 basis points from the prior year despite absorbing current year inflationary pressures as well as pressure from prior year that was capitalized and flowing into this year's P&amp;L. Favorable mix and FX hedge gains also helped support the increase in gross margin. Adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 27.5%, down 50 basis points from the prior year. While gross margin was up, this was offset by higher operating expenses due to increased investments in R&amp;D, aligned to our plan to improve our vitality index through new product innovation as well as higher commercial infrastructure costs to support new product uptake.Net interest and other nonoperating expenses of $57 million was higher than our expectations and significantly higher than the prior year due to certain foreign currency losses in the quarter as well as higher interest rates. Our adjusted tax rate of 16.3% was in line with expectations. Turning to cash and liquidity. Operating cash flows were $348 million and free cash flow totaled $165 million. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $320 million. Our balance sheet remains strong, providing strategic and financial flexibility for future growth. Moving to our updated financial outlook for 2023. Based on another strong quarter of results, we are again raising our full year 2023 outlook. We are confident that we will continue to grow our top line above market rates and expand operating margin while continuing to reinvest in our business for future growth.We are increasing and narrowing our constant currency revenue growth range to 7% to 7.5% with an expected foreign currency exchange headwind of 50 basis points. We are also increasing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.47 to $7.57. Additionally, due to certain FX-related pressures and higher interest rates, we now expect net interest and other nonoperating expenses to be around $200 million for the year. Our expectation around tax rate and total shares outstanding remains unchanged. And we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Our Q3 and Q4 revenue cadence expectations are unchanged. Q3 revenue dollars are expected to be sequentially down versus Q2 and in line with normal seasonality, and Q4 will be our strongest quarter on a dollar basis.While we expect momentum gained from the first half to flow into the second half of the year, recent and new sanctions on Russia may mute growth. And regarding selling day impact, we continue to expect Q3 to have a selling day headwind of about 150 basis points, while Q4 will have about 100 basis point tailwind. Overall, the net day rate impact for the full year is not meaningful. From a margin perspective, we expect Q3 to be our low watermark for the year from both a gross margin and operating margin standpoint. While gross margin will have less variability from quarter-to-quarter, we expect Q3 operating margin to step down sequentially between 150 and 200 basis points due to the normal seasonality of our business. We expect Q4 to step up significantly on a sequential basis, delivering our highest operating margin for the year.Importantly, we remain committed to investing for future growth while delivering meaningful full year margin expansion in 2023. We're really pleased with how our team is navigating a challenging environment. In summary, we delivered another quarter of excellent top line results, beating our expectations while managing very real supply chain challenges. We are building on our early momentum through continued execution and are again able to increase our full year guidance. We are also reiterating our confidence and expectation to be a 4% plus or even mid-single-digit top line grower in a normalized market while delivering strong earnings. In short, our business has never been stronger. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri.Keri Mattox: Thanks, Suky. Before we start the Q&amp;A session, just a quick reminder to please limit yourself to a single question and one follow-up so that we can get through as many questions as possible during the call.

However, it may also be time for investors to consider investing in clean water stocks as part of a balanced clean energy portfolio.  Concerns about water quality will drive the growth in clean water stocks. You may not remember the exact number from your school days, but 70% of the earth’s surface is covered in water. Supply is not the primary issue.  That issue would be quality. Only about 1% of the world’s water is immediately available to be consumed by humans. Therefore, water treatment will remain a major growth driver for water stocks. This generally takes the form of water purification and water monitoring.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAlso, there are opportunities as work is done to repair an aging water infrastructure. The 2021 Infrastructurd Bill passed by the United States Congress includes $55 billion for upgrading the nation’s water infrastructure.  Fortunately, investors have several options to choose from when searching for clean water stocks. Here are three choices that give investors the ability to fill out a clean energy portfolio.  Consolidated Water (CWCO) A photo of small bubbles in a container of water.Source: khak/ShutterStock.comIf you have an appetite for small-cap stocks, Consolidated Water (NASDAQ:CWCO) is one to put on your radar. The company is addressing the need for both water treatment and desalination. Both markets are expected to show a strong compound annual growth rate (CAGR) throughout the next five years.  The California-based company does busines in a variety of international markets. In the U.S., its primary market is in the southwest. Not surprisingly, this is an area where water scarcity is a growing concern.  Consolidated Water has a strong balance sheet, and is showing strong revenue growth. In its first quarter 2023 earnings report, the company posted a 68% year-over-year increase in revenue. However, that’s not translating into earnings growth at this time. The company is consistently profitable, but it expects to post a slight year-over-year decline in earnings. Still, analysts project the stock to grow by approximately 20% this year.  Story continuesPentair (PNR) In this photo illustration the Pentair (PNR) logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comPentair (NYSE:PNR) is next on this list of clean water stocks. The company develops solutions for water filtration that also address the need for sustainability. The company launched its Pentair Rocean Reservoir home water filtration system. In addition to reducing or removing 76 contaminants, this will help address the pollution problem that plastic water bottles present.  The company is still largely known for its pool equipment business. That was responsible for the company’s strong revenue growth in 2021. In 2023, Pentair faces tough comparisons, but revenue is holding up so far.  PNR stock may present investors with an interesting discrepancy. Specifically, the company’s earnings are projected to grow by 10% this year and it has a fair valuation with a forward P/E ratio of just 18x.  Normally earnings growth precedes stock price growth. However, analysts are forecasting the PNR stock price to fall by 3%. Even if the stock price growth doesn’t materialize right away, you get a sustainable dividend that has been increasing for 48 consecutive years, and comes with a 29% payout ratio.  Xylem (XYL) xylem appSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAs I mentioned in the introduction, the world’s water infrastructure is in desperate need of an overhaul. A leading research firm sets that this maintenance will continue to grow at a rate of 10% every year. That’s where Xylem (NYSE:XYL) comes into play.  Xylem is a water technology company that makes products to help maintain equipment at wastewater treatment plants. One of the common problems the company addresses is leaky pipes. This is important because the average water main in the U.S. may be up to 50 years old. That being said, the company’s business isn’t limited to the U.S.In fact, it does business in more than 150 countries.  Of the clean water stocks on this list, Xylem is the one with the highest valuation. It’s trading at 33 times forward earnings. Still, the company is projected to have yearly earnings growth of 10%, and analysts are only projecting a 3% increase in the XYL stock price.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

MuncriefThank you, Scott. Pleasure to be here this morning. We appreciate everyone taking the time to join us. Devon's second quarter performance can be defined as another one of solid execution on all fronts as our business continued to strengthen and build operational momentum throughout the quarter. The attractive per share growth we've consistently delivered quarter after quarter, demonstrates the efficiency of our disciplined business model, the quality of our Delaware focused asset portfolio and the team's execution capabilities and the benefits of our cash return framework. The chart on Slide 4 provides a very compelling visual of this success, showcasing our impressive track record of value creation. Since we unveiled the industry-first framework in late 2020, we have deployed $12 billion towards dividends, share buybacks, debt reduction and accretive bolt-on acquisitions. The cumulative value of these actions equate to nearly 2x the value of Devon's pro forma market capitalization from just a few years ago. As you can see from our diversified actions to date, we have carefully designed our cash return framework to be nimble with the flexibility to allocate free cash flow across multiple avenues to optimize financial results through the cycle. Importantly, this disciplined execution has been rewarded by the market with our equity performance, achieving the highest return of any stock in the entire S&amp;P 500 over this period. Now let's go through some of our second quarter highlights and operating trends in greater detail. Beginning with production, the team did a great job growing oil volumes by 8% on a year-over-year basis this past quarter. this result surpassed midpoint guidance expectations and for us set a new all-time high oil production record for the company by averaging 323,000 barrels per day in the quarter. Additionally, this volume growth was supported by an infrastructure that includes several strategic midstream assets that we have selectively invested in through the years and have taken equity stakes in an effort to enhance the result from our core E&amp;P operations. A key driver of this record-setting result was higher completion activity in the Delaware Basin. By leveraging the benefits of a temporary fourth frac crew and consistently improving cycle times, we were able to bring online 76 new Delaware wells in the quarter, which was a few more than we originally planned due to efficiency gains. Importantly, the well productivity from this batch of wells in Delaware was excellent and included a Wolfcamp B appraisal success that strengthens the depth and quality of our resource in the area. We also had a successful redevelopment test in the Eagle Ford and advanced a handful of other interesting appraisal projects across our diversified asset base that it reinforces our confidence in the resource upside that currently exist across our portfolio. Looking ahead, with higher levels of completion activity in the second quarter, we expect our production profile to continue to strengthen the upcoming third quarter. A good visual of this operational momentum can be seen on Slide 7, with oil volumes expected to grow to a range of 322,000 to 330,000 barrels per day in the upcoming quarter. As I touched on earlier, the capital spending to drive this growth trajectory was a touch ahead of expectations due to very strong execution from our drilling and completion teams that brought forward activity into the quarter. Clay will spend time and cover this topic later, but I am extremely proud to share that we've set several operational records at both the basin and company level, contributing to the record-setting drilled and completed feet per day metrics we have achieved year-to-date. In addition to our strong operating efficiencies, our business is also beginning to benefit from service cost deflation as contracts are refreshed. This is driven by reduced activity from natural gas-focused companies and private producers over the past few months resulted -- resulting in improved availability of services and cost deflation in virtually every category. Although this is a very dynamic environment, we've observed the most downward pressure to date in the areas of tubulars, rig rates, fuel and other miscellaneous drilling services that will begin to positively impact our cost structure as we enter the end of this year. We also anticipate price movement with pressure pumping, which is our largest cost category in a very near future. While it's still somewhat premature to say what and set what our firm outlook for 2024 is, our expectations for deflationary trends should continue. We have the potential for meaningful savings from peak well costs as pricing improvements gradually flow through our cost structure over the next year or so. With a free cash flow model that our business generated, we had another great quarter of cash returns. We returned $462 million to shareholders through our fixed plus variable dividend which we have paid out now for 12 consecutive quarters. We also have an active buyback program that resulted in the repurchase of nearly 4 million shares over the past 3 months. We believe this balance between dividends and buyback offers investors the powerful combination of an attractive yield and steady per share growth through the cycle. Now moving to Slide 11. With the progress that our business has made year-to-date, we are well on our way to meeting the capital objectives associated with our 2023 plan. The momentum we have established places us on track to deliver a production per share growth rate of approximately 9% for the year. Importantly, the activity required to fund this growth is self-funded at a $40 WTI price or approximately half of where we are today and is delivering returns on capital employed greater than 20% at today's commodity prices. While once again, it is too early to provide firm guidance for next year. The trajectory of our business sets us up for a strong outlook in 2024 as well. Given current market fundamentals, we plan to invest at levels that will sustain our productive capacity and any improvements that we see from lower service costs will accrue to our shareholders in the form of higher free cash flow generation. This disciplined pursuit of value over volume positions us to continue to deliver another year of differentiated cash returns and highly competitive returns on invested capital versus the broader market. And now with that, I'll now turn the call over to Clay to cover our operational highlights. Clay?Clay M. GasparThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter operating results demonstrated that our business is performing at a high level and building momentum as we head into the second half of the year. As Rick touched on, this positive trajectory is underpinned by improving capital efficiency from faster cycle times, improving service costs and positive appraisal results that will contribute to our production profile and financial results over the balance of this year and more significantly into 2024. Today, I plan to provide a brief overview of the second quarter results across our assets as well as highlight some upcoming catalysts. The most significant contributor to Devon's second quarter operating success, so once again, our franchise asset in the Delaware Basin. As you can see on Slide 8, more than 60% of our capital activity was deployed to this prolific basin, allowing us to run a consistent program of 16 rigs. With the fourth completion crew at work in the first half of the year, we were able to place 76 wells online in the second quarter, up more than 80% compared to the first quarter. This elevated completion activity grew our Delaware production to 420,000 BOE per day and is expected to underpin volume growth in the third quarter as well. While we had great results across our acreage position, a key project I would like to highlight from the quarter was our Mule development in Eddy County, New Mexico. We've talked in the past about the important appraisal work that we do each year with 10% to 20% of our capital budget. The Mule pad is an example to provide you some visibility into the fruits of this labor. This 11-well project successfully codeveloped multiple landing zones within the Wolfcamp with particularly exciting results from the appraisal of deeper Wolfcamp B benches. The initial results from these 6 wells targeting the Wolfcamp B landing zones average greater than 3,100 BOE per day with 44% oil cut. Per well recoveries are on trend to exceed 2 million barrels of oil equivalent. Importantly, these highly commercial appraisal results de-risk and enhance the economic expectations on approximately 100 Wolfcamp B locations in the Cotton Draw area. Furthermore, these deeper Wolfcamp locations are expected to be highly competitive within our capital allocation framework going forward. The Delaware team also continued to make progress advancing drilling and completions efficiencies across our operations in the basin. In the Wolfcamp, we improved drilling productivity by about 10% on a per foot basis over the past year, while some of our best spud release times for 2-mile laterals pushing below 15 days. Completion efficiencies have also steadily improved with our cycle times decreasing by 9% year-to-date and compared to 2022. Averaging a record completion pace of more than 2,200 feet per day in the quarter, this operational progress has been accomplished in conjunction with an even higher safety and environmental focus and expectation. The great work our team has done to drive improvements across the entire planning and execution of our resources, coupled with the broader service cost deflation trends are positioning our business to be even more efficient as we head into 2024. Moving to the Eagle Ford. Our 3-rig program resulted in 29 gross wells placed online during the quarter. This activity, which was concentrated in the recently acquired acreage in Karnes County, drove a 9% increase in productivity versus the previous quarter. This margin -- this high-margin growth was driven by strong well productivity achieved from a balanced mix of development and appraisal activity designed to refine the next stage of development for this prolific resource play.Our top development project in the quarter was headlined by our LP Butler pad. This 4-well pad developed a highly charged [scheme of pay] in the volatile oil window of the play that exceeded predrill expectations, reaching an impressive average 30-day rate of 3,600 BOE per day with a 56% oil cuts. On the appraisal front, a key success in the quarter was the [Crudwood] unit. This development project in Karnes County tested infill spacing ranging from 140 to 150 -- excuse me, 180-foot and roughly 30 wells per section. The initial 30-day rates from this package of wells averaged 2,000 BOE per day, resulting in highly commercial returns that adds to the depth and quality of our inventory in the play. Also, adding to the commerciality of this tighter spacing was our drilling performance where we broke a company record averaging over 2,000 feet per day, which included the fastest spud to rig release time in the company history of only 5.7 days.As we look to allocate capital for 2024 and beyond, the positive operating results we've achieved year-to-date served as valuable data points to optimize future development activity in the Eagle Ford and other -- and further deepens our convictions of the resource upside that a crop that exists across this entire field. Moving to the Williston. Volumes began to rebound in the second quarter, growing 4% quarter-over-quarter to 56,000 BOE per day. This growth was driven by improved weather, higher uptimes on existing producers and successful adjustments to completion and production techniques for some of the new well activity. These completion and production modifications consisted of change to a larger proppant size designed to mitigate mobility of sand and a shift in artificial lift techniques to improve well uptime.With the favorable flowback results on 2 pads that have deployed these techniques, we have high confidence that the well's productivity will improve as we see progress throughout the year. Looking at inventory, we now have more than 150 wells remaining and identified significant refrac opportunities across hundreds of producing wells in the field, providing us the optionality to deploy steady reinvestment in this play for multiple years to come. Turning to the Powder River Basin. The key objective of our 2023 program is to continue to appraise and methodically refine our understanding of the Niobrara so that we can optimize this resource for future development. With this focus, the team has made substantial progress over the last year, establishing repeatable commercial results with 3-mile laterals across a significant portion of our acreage in Converse County. Furthermore, since we're not observing any degradation in the results from 3-well spacing, we plan to test 4 well per section later this year. And lastly, we're also encouraged by the early flow rates from appraisal activity recently brought online in the northern portion of our leasehold position that could extend the Niobrara potential into [Campbell] County.I'll provide more updates on these tests in the coming quarters, but it's been evident that our 300,000-acre net acreage position in the Powder River Basin is providing Devon important resource catalyst for the future. Lastly, in the Anadarko Basin, production volumes grew 10% from the previous quarter, driven by the ramp-up in completion activity funded by a drilling carry from our Dow joint venture. The operational execution from this program was superb with well costs consistently coming in below pre-drill expectations and the initial flow rates from several wells exceeding 3,000 BOE per day. To date, we have only utilized approximately half of the 133 well carrier agreement we have in place with Dow. We anticipate the remaining carry will provide us sufficient runway to support our current pace of activity for the next 18 to 24 months, and we're open to expanding this scope of partnership as we successfully demonstrated in the past. For the remainder of 2023, we plan to bring on 10 new wells weighted towards year-end. In summary, I'm proud of the capital efficiency results that each of our asset teams are delivering during the quarter and the strong momentum that we have built heading into the second half of '23. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the financial review. Jeff?Jeffrey L. RitenourThanks, Clay. I'll spend my time today covering the key drivers of our second quarter financial results and provide some insights into our outlook for the rest of the year. Beginning with production, a key driver of second quarter volumes exceeding midpoint guidance was efficiency gains that compress cycle times, leading us to capture a few more days online than planned. Looking ahead, the benefits of higher completion activity from the Delaware in the first half of the year is expected to drive volumes -- oil volumes higher in the upcoming third quarter and leaves us on track to meet our volume targets for the full year as well. On the capital front, we've invested 55% of our budget year-to-date. This weighting to the first half of the year is due to higher completion activity driven by a fourth temporary frac crew in the Delaware Basin. With this temporary crew recently released, we expect a lower capital spending profile as we head into the second half of the year and remain confident in our capital spending guidance range for the full year. Regional oil pricing once again remained strong with realizations near WTI benchmark levels in the second quarter. We're also seeing strength in the oil price curve for the second half of 2023. This positive trend is providing a meaningful impact to our returns and cash flow generation capabilities with every $1 uplift in WTI resulting in about $100 million of additional annual cash flow for the company.Despite the strength we saw in oil pricing in the second quarter, we did experience weakness in both natural gas and NGL realizations. We do expect improved markets for gas and NGLs in the second half of the year, which should translate into better price realizations for us across the portfolio. Moving to operating expenses. Our field level costs were right in line with expectations for the quarter. However, we do expect a minor uptick in per unit cost in the second half of 2023, driven by our recently executed water handling joint venture in the Delaware Basin. Our new water JV provides us significant operational flexibility to enhance scale and multiple disposal options. In addition, the JV materially lowers our future midstream capital requirements in the area. Looking forward, our equity stake in the JV will provide us distributions over time, offsetting the incremental operating cost at the asset level. We could also choose to bring forward value by monetizing this asset at some point in the future. Cutting to the bottom line, we generated $1.4 billion of operating cash flow during the quarter. Combined with the low reinvestment rates to fund our disciplined capital program, we were able to generate free cash flow for the 12th straight quarter. Furthermore, we've delivered these results across a variety of market conditions showcasing the durability of our business strategy. With this free cash flow, our top priority was the return of capital to our shareholders. A key use of our excess cash in the quarter was the funding of our fixed plus variable dividend with the Board declaring a payout of $0.49 per share. This distribution will be paid at the end of September.h. With this free cash flow, our top priority was the return of capital to our shareholders. A key use of our excess cash in the quarter was the funding of our fixed plus variable dividend with the board declaring a payout of $0.49 per share. This distribution will be paid at the end of September. In addition to dividends, we also see great value in our equity and continue to be active buyers of our stock. During the quarter, we repurchased an additional $200 million of stock, bringing our year-to-date total to approximately $750 million. With the authorization we have in place, we remain on pace to repurchase approximately 9% of our outstanding shares by the end of next year. These opportunistic buybacks are a critically important tool for us to compound per share growth for investors over time. And to round out my prepared remarks this morning, I'd like to give a brief update on our investment-grade financial position. We exited the quarter with $3.5 billion of liquidity and a low net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.7x. This leverage resides well below our mid-cycle leverage target of 1x or less. Subsequent to quarter end, we took the next step in improving our financial position by retiring $242 million of debt at maturity. With a strong cash flow our business is generating, we'll have additional opportunities to pare down our debt and maturities coming due in 2024 and 2025 as well. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments.Richard E. MuncriefThank you, Jeff. Good job. I would like to close out today by reiterating 4 key messages from our prepared remarks. Number one, our disciplined execution in the second quarter demonstrates our business is performing at a high level and building momentum as we head into the second half of the year. Number two, this positive trajectory is underpinned by better capital efficiency from higher and faster cycle times, strong well productivity and improving service costs that will contribute to our financial results over the remainder of this year and into 2024. Number three, our resource base continued to strengthen this quarter. This was evidenced by our highly commercial appraisal results in the deeper Wolfcamp and a positive redevelopment test in the Eagle Ford that adds to our conviction of resource upside across our portfolio. And number four, with this advantaged resource base, we are deeply committed to a disciplined pursuit of per share value creation over production volume growth. Foundational to this commitment is our carefully designed cash turn framework that has the flexibility to allocate free cash flow across multiple avenues to optimize shareholder value through the cycle. And now with that, I'll turn the call back over to Scott as we get into Q&amp;A.Scott CoodyThanks, Rick. We'll now open the call to Q&amp;A. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. This allows us to get to more of your questions on the call today. With that, operator, we'll take our first question.Question and Answer SessionOperatorWe have our first question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.Neil Singhvi MehtaThe first question is just on the production profile for the back half of the year. As you indicated, you guys are focused on value over volume. But some of the pushback we've done this morning has been centered around volumes being a little bit below consensus for the back half of the year. So maybe your thoughts on whether there's some conservatism in the way that you model this out and where are areas potentially that could surprise the upside?Clay M. GasparNeil, thanks for the question. This is Clay. I just want to reiterate, we feel good about our full year guide certainly, with the accelerated activity, things moving a little quicker on the D&amp;C front, that pulled a little bit of our production forward. That's great on a per well basis, but you get a little bit of lumpiness in the productivity. So we get -- we pulled some of that third quarter volume forward. So we maintain our full year guide, but we've always seen kind of a role as we pull back from that 4 frac fleet in the Delaware to the third. So nothing new, nothing unplanned, but consistent with what we've been showing and once again, feel real good about the full year guide.Neil Singhvi MehtaAll right. That's great. And then the follow-up is just, can you talk a little bit about this water handling contracts in the Delaware. There's a modest bump up in the LOE in the guide, so a little bit of background on what it is, and how we should think about it?Jeffrey L. RitenourYes, Neil, this is Jeff. Happy to do that. Yes, we're excited about the flexibility and the scale that, that's going to bring to our water handling in the basin we're going to have multiple disposal options as opposed to what we had before. It does bring a little higher operating cost at the asset level. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, with the equity stake that we've got in the joint venture, we'll be receiving distributions on a go-forward basis, which is going to more than offset that additional LOE costs that we're going to see. So -- and as I also mentioned in the prepared remarks, we also think it provides us a great opportunity with that equity position to monetize the asset at some point in the future. So really excited about the flexibility it gives to us operationally. As Clay will attest, there's certainly a fair amount of water we got to move out in the Delaware Basin. So this additional flexibility and scale, we think, is going to be a real positive for us. I'll also add, it certainly helps us on the capital efficiency front because it helps us to eliminate a pretty material amount of capital that we otherwise would have had to spend on water infrastructure as you look out over the next couple of years.OperatorWe have our next question comes from Nitin Kumar from Mizuho.Nitin KumarRick, you've kind of mentioned a little bit of an acceleration of activity into the first half. It's a little bit different than what you had said when you gave the guidance for the year, it does imply a little bit slower cadence of completions in the second half of 2023. And I'm just wondering, could we use that as a baseline for 2024 in terms of activity levels?Richard E. MuncriefNitin, I'll tell you what we like to do is we think most important thing for us is we like the consistency. As you think about quarter-over-quarter, we've been pretty consistent for a while on our production. And we like to look at things on an annual basis. Clay mentioned the fact that you do have some lumpiness from time to time just through acceleration. You could have working interest changes, you could have some assessment work, you do all sorts of things like that. But I think for us, the most important thing, Nitin, would be that let's just look year-over-year, and I know that we -- people like to look at things on a quarterly basis. But from my perspective, I want to watch say year-over-year profile, and let's lean in on share repurchases and let's make sure that we get that growth on a per share basis. And Clay, is there anything else you want to add to that?Clay M. GasparYes, Rick, in your question was, should we expect that run rate. Just remember that fourth frac crew in the front half of the year we are consuming DUCs essentially in that period. Just if you look at Delaware Basin, and then when we're running 3 frac crews as we will in the second half of the year, we're essentially generating DUCs. And in a fully optimized world, we would pick up and drop that fourth spot crew to optimize. I would say in today's world, what we're doing is really trying to bring that crew in, get them fully up to speed, let them run through the opportunities that we have. And then put them on pause in this case, for about 6 months, we'll pick them back up again in January. You'll see capital tick up, but you'll certainly see the production tick up as well related to that crew. So that does exacerbate the lumpiness that we talk about. I'd love to have a straight line. But again, when you pan out and look at an annual basis like Rick talked about, you really see the consistency of our program.Nitin KumarI guess for my follow-up, we've seen some private assets change hands here in the last 3 months or so. The shape of the Delaware Basin is -- has changed a little bit. You've previously talked about scale and the importance of that to the new business model that Devon initiated 3 years ago. So just any thoughts on the M&amp;A market going forward? Do you see room for consolidation here? And what is the role that you think you might play?Richard E. MuncriefNitin, that's a great question. I think we've talked about this fairly consistently. As far as consolidation, I think; a, it's going to continue to happen. I think as you start looking across many companies' portfolios, and we're not one of those companies, but there's a lot of companies out there, many of the smaller companies they're going to start looking for options because they are getting light on inventory. Some of the private consolidations that we've seen recently that you're referring to -- many of those were companies that exhibited performance. It was really -- quite honestly, it was pretty impressive in how fast they grew their production, how fast they were going through that inventory, but they also see the challenge of where they're going to go in the future. And for companies like us, we're going to be very, very disciplined, and we just haven't had an appetite to really take on that steep decline rate that you would be inheriting. You have to be very, very thoughtful and it gets to be tricky. Now I will say there were some pretty creative solutions with some of those companies that had those and bringing some 2 and 3 companies altogether to make some pretty interesting transaction. But I think it just represents the creativity in our sector. I think you're going to continue to see consolidation. I think it makes a ton of sense, and it's going to happen for numerous reasons. And over time, you'll continue to see companies consolidate, and there'll be companies such as Devon, I believe, that will be the beneficiaries of those because we're going to be very disciplined, and I think we'll try to be opportunistic and make sure that we make moves that just build a stronger and stronger, more durable company. And so -- but you're spot on. I think consolidation in our industry is going to continue.OperatorWe have our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup.Scott Andrew GruberCurious about the returns you're seeing on the refrac wells in the Eagle Ford. How do those compare to a new well in the basin, and how does that influence, how you prosecute that program going forward?Clay M. GasparYes. Thanks for the question, Scott. This is Clay. We're really excited about the work that we've seen to date. We have about 30 tests we're still learning on what's the right wells to go in and refrac what's the right techniques to go in and prosecute those. And so I would say for only being 30 wells in 30 refracs in we're very encouraged about the results. We're encouraged about the inventory that we had. I should note, in the Validus acquisition we did, we had 0 refracs underwritten in the acquisition price. And now we're seeing more material upside, both in redevelopment and in refracs. I would say on a heads-up basis, when you think about returns, the better ones certainly compete heads up with the wells that we're drilling today. But you really have to really think about how do you prosecute those, the right approach, and you end up getting a variety of them. So I would say it's too early to tell on an exact quantity and the overall return, but certainly, the top half of what we've derisked today, we feel really good about and will certainly become more of a regular part of our investment opportunities on an annual basis.Scott Andrew GruberAnd just an unrelated follow-up, but I did notice that the gas [feed] on the quarter at least versus our numbers, was largely driven by the Anadarko and by the Williston. Was anything going on in those basins that led to a gas production step up. Are you seeing the gas oil ratio of the base there step higher? Just some color on the gas production in Anadarko and Williston be great.Clay M. GasparYes. Thanks for that. The Anadarko Basin certainly is our gassier option. We have a lot of running room right now. We're more focused on the liquids-rich portion of it. But even relative to the rest of our portfolio, that's certainly a gassier part of the mix. When we look to the wells that we're developing in Williston, a little bit higher gas cut there as well. Very importantly, we've done a good job of getting that gas down the line, through the meter and sold rather than flaring. Happy to report our flaring numbers continue to be heading in the right direction around the company, especially in Williston. And that's certainly not without challenges. I think that's the bigger contributors to the increase in gas, getting that through the meter, getting that sold is always a very high objective, but we're also really focused on the oil side of the equation, which is where our revenues really come from.OperatorWe have our next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.Arun JayaramI know you guys aren't yet ready to provide more specific [called] soft commentary on 2024, but I did want to get maybe some of your early read on 2024 CapEx. If we look at your second half '23 CapEx guidance, it's around $1.7 billion or $850 million a quarter. If we annualize that, that would be about $3.4 billion. It sounds like you would need a, call it, a partial fourth frac crew to execute your 2024 plan. So I just wanted to say if those are kind of the elements should we be thinking about CapEx in the mid, call it, $3.5 billion kind of range. But again, just wanted to get some preliminary thoughts.Clay M. GasparYes. I appreciate that, Arun. I think your logic on how to get there as far as rig count, frac fleet count, I completely agree with. I'm going to hold back on giving you a number for next year. There's a lot of things going on around what's happening in commodity price, therefore, rig count, therefore, inflation, deflation, those things have pretty material impacts, and we're just going to hold back. But I think directionally, think of the same similar activity as a really good starting point.Arun JayaramGreat. And my follow-up maybe for Jeff. Jeff, I wanted to kind of zero in on the Williston Basin. This is called the third quarter in a row that we've seen relatively low realizations for natural gas and NGLs. So I was just wondering if you could provide what's going on there? And is this going to be a persistent impact to you going forward?Jeffrey L. RitenourYes, Arun, this is Jeff. Yes, I appreciate the question. As Clay mentioned earlier, there, particularly in the Williston, where you've got some gas is obviously not the lion's share of the production mix. But can be a real challenge, obviously, to move the gas up there given the infrastructure and the constraints that we have. I would tell you, when you look at those realizations in particular in the -- excuse me, in the Williston, you're going to see some wild volatility just given the deducts that we have from a realization standpoint. And so it's not a -- it's not going to be as clean and consistent as you would usually see in some of our other basins. I'd also point out, as you're well aware, it's pretty immaterial in the grand scheme of things, given the margins that we see from the oil barrels there.OperatorWe have our next question comes from Neal Dingmann from Truist.Neal David DingmannMy first question, guys, is on your Delaware Basin specifically. Maybe, Clay, could you speak to what benefits that recent Wolfcamp B appraisal success might have on -- I mean maybe it's too early to say what it might have on total production. But maybe what you think the upside of that could drive in the, I don't know, later this year or next year? And then just wondering how you view also the benefits. You've touched on this earlier in your comments. How you view the benefits of bringing some of those wells forward this year, not the appraisals of course, but the others.Clay M. GasparYes, Neal, first question around the B. I mean, this is so important and fundamental to what we do around the assessment work. We talked about on several calls, this 10% to 20% of the dollars that aren't directed towards the most near-term capital efficient, but it's so important that we dig deeper out into the portfolio to derisk these opportunities. And when we see after several reps of really understanding what that opportunity is, and they certainly jump up to the front of the line compete even with some of the best stuff we're investing in today, it's pretty exciting. And so it's something we just want to share specifically in Cotton Draw, specifically in these B zones. These are really accretive and very valuable. Now full disclosure, they're already baked into the inventory numbers that we guide to, but they're baked in on a risk standpoint. So as we derisk them, net-net to us, there's real value creation and being able to prosecute on those. The second question was around moving the opportunities forward. So that's just -- we have 16 rigs running. They're all running just a little bit ahead of pace. The completion crews, same deal there, 4 frac crews for the front half of the year in the Delaware Basin, they're just running just a little bit ahead of pace. And so that fourth crew that we toggle on and off originally was slated to run through October. And then we pull it back to September than August. We finally were able to release that in July and accomplish everything that we needed to accomplish. So you can imagine the well cost savings and the value creation on a per well basis. Now it kind of monkeys with our quarterly numbers a little bit, as you can see. But overall, we're always trying to pull that value forward. We're thinking about per well full cycle cost, how do we continue to drive that? And then how does it manifest to the bottom line of the company.Neal David DingmannThat makes sense. And maybe the last one for Jeff, just on capital allocation, just how aggressively Jeff, do you all think about going forward, do you all plan to target net debt while combining this with your strong shareholder return program.Jeffrey L. RitenourYes, I appreciate the question. I think going forward, you're going to see our -- as our framework has been pretty consistent from day 1, as Rick mentioned in his in his opening remarks, you shouldn't expect a material change in that approach. We're going to be pretty balanced. As you saw this year-to-date, between the variable dividend and the stock buyback, it's been about 50-50, which, to me, is a great example of how well our framework is working last year when we had much higher prices and significant free cash flow generation. We leaned in on the variable dividends. And this year, when you've seen that pull back, you've seen much more balance from us with the stock buybacks as well. Going forward, where we are from a cash balance and a framework standpoint, as we generate excess free cash flow here in the back half of the year given the lower capital spend we expect and the higher oil prices that we're projecting in the back half of this year, we should generate significant free cash flow, we're going to look to build our cash balance back. And then with the remainder of the cash, we're going to focus on, obviously, the variable and the stock buybacks on an opportunistic basis.OperatorWe have our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.Douglas George Blyth LeggateI have 2 if you don't mind. One is on mix, and one is on portfolio capital intensity. And I guess it's that we've seen this trend obviously across a number of your peers. But if you look at the oil mix in your production. It's obviously been up and down a little bit over the last couple of years, but it seems to have dropped now below 50%. I'm just wondering when you think about how you're allocating capital between your different operating areas, particularly, I guess, Anadarko versus Permian. How do you anticipate as you optimize your spend that, that oil mix is going to trend? I've got a follow-up, please.Jeffrey L. RitenourYes, Doug, this is Jeff. I would say we view that the mix of the oil to be pretty consistent on a year-over-year basis. We're really focused on rate of return and the returns that we generate in our play. We're agnostic, frankly, to oil or gas. But as we all know, certainly, oil is the higher-margin product today, and our focus has been, particularly in the Delaware. So with the Dow JV that we have in the Anadarko Basin, that obviously reduces those returns and helps from a capital efficiency standpoint and makes that activity pretty competitive with our broader portfolio. But we -- I think we would all tell you, and it's not going to be a surprise to anybody on the call that the Delaware without doubt is our most capital-efficient asset today, it's oil-weighted. That's where the bulk of our margins come from. And as we move forward into 2024 and beyond, we would expect it to capture the lion's share of our capital investment.Douglas George Blyth LeggateOkay. I guess, we'll take another look at that. But my follow-up, Jeff, is, look, I realize that inflation and cost and everything else is a well-trodden path. Everyone understands what's going on there, what has gone on there. But I want to share an observation with you just to get your opinion on this and see what you think. When I look at your peers, obviously, one of your large peers reported this morning that the capital intensity simplistically on a per BOE basis is up about 30%. Your's is up about 80%. For example, if I take your spend in the first half of last year, it was about $10 a BOE. First half of this year, it's about $17 a BOE and production is obviously up small. So I'm just wondering if you can address that and tell us what you think is going on? Is there capital in there that is transitory, for example, in the infrastructure you talked about, or what else should we be looking at to try and understand what's changed there?Jeffrey L. RitenourYes, Doug, I would say, as you know, it's a mix of things. Without a doubt, one of the things that we've talked about a lot is the inflation that hit us and the certainly started in the back half of last year and worked its way into this year. That's a big driver of that. The timing of our contracts and the roll-off of our contract structure as it relates to all of the different cost categories, I think has also disproportionately hit us relative to our peers. Said another way, I thought our teams did a great job of protecting us from the inflation in the very early part of the cycle. So think about the fall of last year and the early part of this year. And now as we worked our way through 2023, alot of those contracts have rolled off into a higher price environment from an inflation standpoint. And so you've seen some of the capital efficiency for our asset base relative to some others certainly change. Obviously, mix is a big driver of that. The shift that we made with the acquisitions in Validus and Rimrock, you're moving away from a more capital-efficient asset in the Delaware from a mix standpoint to really great assets, really great returns in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford. But as I mentioned in my response to the previous question, they're certainly not as capital efficient as what we see in the Delaware. So you put all that together, and I think that's what you're seeing really driving that capital efficiency rate of change relative to some of our peers. I will say, though, when you step back and you look at that capital efficiency on an absolute basis, company versus company, we feel really good about where we sit, and we look really, really competitive against the top-tier companies in the space. That rate of change, as you point out, has just been pretty material and have been a challenge on a relative basis as you all screen for capital efficiency. But when we look at the capital efficiency on an absolute basis, we still feel really good about where we sit. And we expect that to improve as we work our way into the future for all the reasons you mentioned earlier, which is we do expect to see some deflation as we work our way through the back half of this year into next year. And as Clay mentioned earlier, the mix of our asset base and the things we're focused on, we think that only is going to add to our productivity moving forward.OperatorOur next question comes from Matthew Portillo from TPH.Matthew Merrel PortilloClay, maybe a question for you to start off on the Bakken. I know that's an asset that has faced some technical challenges to start the year. Could you impact some of the headwinds a bit more that you faced in the first half and maybe a little bit more around the completion design change that you guys have made that may start to show some improvement in the well results in the back half and heading into 2024?Clay M. GasparHappy to do it, Matt. Thanks for the question. As I think about the Williston, it is certainly maybe the most mature of all the oil resource plays. We're learning things for the first time what these late innings really look like. Certainly, with the Rimrock acquisition, bringing those wells in, we faced some challenges really from a subsurface standpoint, but also some from a relatively surface standpoint, and I'll talk about both. From a subsurface standpoint, one of the challenges we faced, specifically with some of the wells we acquired is the nature of the depletion these crosscut wells are really unique. And so we've seen wells that we've drilled through essentially have a depletion and then essentially [verger] pressure and then back to depletion throughout the lateral. Producing those -- completing those and producing those have been a relatively unique challenge. We haven't seen anywhere else. We've gotten some solution I've talked about earlier. I think we're doing really well on getting those wells producing consistently getting them unloaded and allowing the proppant to stay in place, which is fundamentally important to be able to producing the wells. More on the surface side, once you get that proppant in place, then you don't have the challenges of artificial lift. You don't have the sand flowing back to surface and adding additional complications. What we really faced in the first quarter was some of these operational challenges and then still in a very tight workover rig environment, reaching for that workover rig, having to stand in line or the opportunity cost of pulling it off of something else we were trying to do has been pretty uniquely challenging. I think we've gotten a good recipe for the wells going forward. A lot of our inventory that we're able to go back to now will not have some of these same challenges. It's more run of the mill, what we've been dealing with in Williston for the last several years and really delivering some really good well results. So yes, the first quarter was challenging from an operational standpoint, especially in the first quarter, compounded by weather. I feel good about the direction we're headed, the response we've had from the team, and the outlook going forward.Matthew Merrel PortilloPerfect. And then just as a follow-up, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned seeing quite a bit of success in the Anadarko Basin and the potential for a further expansion of the partnership. Just curious, is that something that you may pursue with Dow, or are you looking at bringing in potentially other partners to continue to progress the asset from a development standpoint?Clay M. GasparWe love -- we cherish our partnerships, and we love it when it's a mutual win-win. Dow has been very pleased with this partnership. We have as well. It's allowed the Anadarko Basin to compete in our pretty rigorous portfolio and so expanding that, certainly, Dow has a very good knowledge of the basin, it would be the easiest to pursue with them. Certainly, look, we're objective. We have other partnerships around the company, but it's something we're regularly talking about with Dow, how will this work for them, how would this work for us? We haven't made any decisions on that, but just thought I would mention, we have an additional runway beyond the current scope that we may end up pursuing at some point.OperatorWith our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC.Scott Michael HanoldI'm just wondering if you've had some thoughts on just the overall maturation and depth of your inventory. It appears with you all that there's a little bit more exploration and refrac and other kind of opportunity. Does that point to the maturity of some of the assets? And is there a little reason more to do more kind of exploration and development of that sort? Or just give us a sense of like when you think about like primary drilling of economics you have today, like how much of a runway do you have?Richard E. MuncriefScott, it's Rick. We feel really good about our runway, but we also are compelled to continue to explore, to continue to assess what we already own. You've heard some several comments, commentary around consolidation opportunities. I think it's incumbent upon this management team to first, let's understand what the opportunities we already have in hand. You've heard Clay talk about how we had -- in the Wolfcamp B, we feel really, really good about some resource potential there. We added in a risk basis, and you go out and you execute on those and you find out that they really are good. And the implication is that not only the offsets of where we're at, but when you think about a 400,000-acre position that we possess in the Delaware, and you can continue to do these and these assessment activities. And quite honestly, you either meet or exceed what your expectations are. That's a good thing. That's better than good. That's a great thing because that adds to your risk or your own risk -- excuse me, your risked inventory that you feel really good. When I say that, that's inventory you're pulling off the shelf and executing on and with phenomenal returns. And so whether it's in the Delaware, whether it's these opportunities that we have in the Eagle Ford, which we're really bullish on, which is the opportunities we see in the Bakken, which we continue to see some nice opportunities there. We feel really good about it. But I think it's incumbent upon this team to continue to assess what our current acreage position is as we compare and contrast executing on that, holding what we have versus going out and buying more consolidating more. So just -- it's real fundamental to our business.Scott Michael HanoldYes. I mean -- and that's good to hear. And I think the question is a lot on sort of the capital efficiency trend as you move from a very high core prolific Delaware Basin to some of these other zones or even to some of these other players like the Anadarko and Eagle Ford and Williston or PRB, right? So it's more about that capital efficiency trend relative to kind of the best stuff you've already drilled?Richard E. MuncriefRight. I think that's what you're going to see. I think you're seeing maturation in a lot of these basins. And if you just think about whether it's -- you've seen it in the Midland Basin, we're not in the Midland Basin, but you've seen that for several years where every year until you start bringing new resource on, you're going to be continuing to evolve and people will tend to go to their highest returns. What -- you've seen it in the Bakken. We've seen it in the Eagle Ford. But I can tell you there's many of these basins, we're excited about the potential that we see with restimulation and some tighter spacing in some cases, we up space in the other areas. We just learned more about the resources we have. But that's been the history of our business over the last 100 years is plays and basins will mature over time until there is either a change in technology, new intervals are found. And so I think you're just -- you're seeing that play out in real time. We're continuing to -- but we're excited about what we're seeing. So hopefully, that's coming across in our -- not only prepared remarks, but some of our answers that whether it's restimulation down in the Eagle Ford, whether it's what we're seeing the assessment work in the Delaware and other place Powder, Anadarko, we're just really excited about what we have.Scott Michael HanoldOkay. I appreciate the added color. And just one quickly on the fixed dividend. You spend a little bit time, Jeff, on buybacks and variables. But remind us of your thoughts on the fixed dividend, what -- where you want that to be? I think it's about 1.5% or something to that effect. Do you feel good about that? Or would you like to see it stronger relative to the S&amp;P or to some of your, obviously, E&amp;P peers?Jeffrey L. RitenourYes. No, absolutely. I'm glad you asked the question. We're absolutely focused on growing the fixed dividend as we work into the future. And so you should expect us on a year-over-year basis to lean in and grow the fixed dividend as we get more and more confident, obviously, in our base game plan and our framework. It's -- yes, I certainly should have mentioned it earlier. It's the priority one as it relates to our cash return framework, and it only falls behind, obviously, the financial strength and the balance sheet. So absolutely expect to see us grow that into the future.OperatorWe have our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.Paul ChengTwo questions, please. First, I think, Clay, you mentioned that Bakken is the most mature, which certainly is the case. And you talk about the refrac and the development opportunity in Eagle Ford can you talk about within your portfolio, have you already looked at what is the refrac and development opportunity in Bakken and how long do you think you may be able to hold the current production spread. The same question, going back into the Eagle Ford. I know it's still early, but for refrac and the development, what kind of WTI and Henry Hub gas price minimum you need in order for those to work.Clay M. GasparYes. So I'll tackle those. Starting with the Williston. It's a very different reservoir rock than the Eagle Ford. The Eagle Ford is very notoriously tight, low permeability, which is a challenge in trying to initially develop. What we're finding is there's some benefits in redevelopment being able to space in wells later in life and not having some of the challenges that we see in other basins. We're not going to be able to do that same kind of model in many other basins because it's fairly unique to the Eagle Ford. When it comes to refracs, it's a little bit different scenario. Williston being on the more mature and also having a fair amount of the development early in the industry's understanding of how best to complete these wells. There's some really inferior completions, and so the opportunity there is a little bit different. It's not from a reservoir standpoint, it's more from a completion standpoint, how do we go in and restimulate some of these wells that were massively understimulated. So therein lies a different opportunity there. The Eagle Ford, you asked about kind of breakeven cost for the refracs, I don't have a very good number for that. I would say, in the top half of the opportunities that we're looking at, many of those are very competitive with what we're drilling today, which is pretty -- a very, very solid return. So I would put it in that bucket. There's still a lot of work to do on refining how do we figure out where is the line and certainly commodity price will play a role in how many of these refracs and potentially even trifracs, you come back again at a later date. Those opportunities will certainly be commodity price dependent.Richard E. MuncriefPaul, it's Rick. I'd just say that when I think about those restem opportunities down the Eagle Ford. In my mind, in a $50 world, as long as you're north of $50 and a $3 Henry Hub, you're going to have some pretty good returns. We're pleased with that. One of the things I'll add, the previous question we had was around some of the assessment work, just -- everybody needs to recall, we're only doing a small percentage of our capital budget with assessment work. It's not like we're really leaning in on that. We do think it's important to allocate a certain amount of capital and really excited about what the -- what it holds for us. That being said, I know at a time when people are hyper focused on capital efficiency, that's fair. It really is. But we also need to think about the future, and when I say the future, it's not next quarter. It's the next 5, 10, 15, 20 years.Scott CoodyAll right. It looks like we're at the top of the hour.

We have Shopify, Occidental, Robinhood, Etsy, and DoorDash. Kicking it off with Shopify, we're looking at losses of just about 2% here in extended trading.Now, the company beating on revenue of 31% growth year-over-year. Subscription revenue was up 21% on a year-over-year basis. The company cash flow positive for the third consecutive quarter in a row. This is a stock that's run up over 30% in the last three months. Expectations were very high going into this report. So we're seeing some selling action in extended trading. And Shopify also closed the day off just about 7 and 1/2%.Let's move on to Robinhood here. And Robinhood shares under a bit of pressure, off just about 4% right now. The company monthly active users missing expectations, 10.8 million. Estimate was for 11.7 million. That was declining from the previous quarter here. And you're taking a look at Robinhood, if we can pull it up on the screen. The stock has been under some pressure, obviously, having a tough time here attracting and keeping their users, with that disappointing number here. Year-to-date, though, we're still looking at gains of just about 52%. So the fact that they did miss on that key metrics, putting some pressure on shares in after hours.Let's head back to Occidental Petroleum. That stock off just about 2% in extended trading. Remember, this is the company that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recently just upped its stake in to about 25%. Earnings missed expectations. Revenue also coming in a bit short, falling 37% from a year ago. Year-to-date, looking at losses of just about 2.5%.All right. Let's take a look at Etsy. That's hot out here with results moments ago, off just about 5.5%. Third quarter revenue guidance missing the midpoint of the range. And that's enough to put pressure on shares here in extended trading. Second quarter revenue up 7.5%, better than expected. Services revenue was up 21%. Active sellers up 12% to 8.31 million buyers up 2.5% to 96.3 million. That was also better than expected. We heard from Etsy in this report, Etsy ads once again are a big driver here to revenue growth. But the stock's still off about 5%.Rounding it out with DoorDash. That stock on the move. This stock posting some gains here, up just about 4%. They raised their full-year guidance here for gross order value. That, of course, is a critical point here in this report. That came-- that coming in better than expected for the second quarter. Revenue up about a third up, 33% on a year-over-year basis, beating the Street's expectations at just over 2 billion-- 2.13 billion. Orders also increasing 25% from a year ago.

VX-548 has been granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations in the U.S. for moderate to severe acute pain. In addition, Vertex has initiated a Phase 2 dose-ranging study of VX-548 in neuropathic pain.Story continuesAbout VX-548VX-548 is an oral, selective NaV1.8 inhibitor that is highly selective for NaV1.8 relative to other NaV channels. NaV1.8 is a voltage-gated sodium channel that plays a critical role in pain signaling in the peripheral nervous system. NaV1.8 is a genetically validated target for the treatment of pain, and Vertex has previously demonstrated clinical proof-of-concept with a small molecule investigational treatment targeting NaV1.8 in multiple pain indications including acute pain, neuropathic pain and musculoskeletal pain. Vertex’s approach is to selectively inhibit NaV1.8 using small molecules with the objective of creating a new class of medicines that have the potential to provide superior relief of pain without the limitations of opioids, including their addictive potential. VX-548 is one of the most recent molecules to enter clinical development from Vertex’s portfolio of NaV1.8 inhibitors.About VertexVertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases.

This could be especially true if economic headwinds momentarily reemerge. Plus, Encompass Health (EHC) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are two medical stocks that have largely outperformed their peers this year and may still offer defensive safety as healthcare is always essential.  Year to date Encompass and Vertex stocks are up +16% and +24% respectively and have easily topped the broader indexes over the last year. This serves as a prelude to why it’s time to buy Encompass and Vertex stock with both companies beating their second-quarter top and bottom line expectations on Tuesday.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEncompass Health: As a provider of integrated healthcare services, Encompass crushed its Q2 earnings expectations. Earnings of $0.95 per share came in 28% above Q2 estimates of $0.74 a share. On the top line, sales of $1.18 billion beat expectations by 2%.

Good evening all and thank you for joining us on the call today. After a strong start to the year, we saw continued momentum into the second quarter across all aspects of the company. Our CF business continues to grow and we are reaching more patients than ever. In the second quarter, this expanded reach drove 14% global safe product revenue growth versus the prior year period. And with this first half performance, we are raising our full year 2023 CF product revenue guidance to a revised range of $9.7 billion to $9.8 billion. As we continue to deliver in CF, we're also investing for future commercial excellence, ahead of multiple potential near-term launches. In exa-cel in both severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia which we expect will be the first in our next wave of launches.Story continuesIn VX-548 for acute pain, another multibillion-dollar commercial opportunity and in our Vanzacaftor triple combination therapy for cystic fibrosis which provides the opportunity to further extend our leadership in CF. In addition to these 4 disease areas, our mid-stage clinical pipeline continues to develop rapidly and marked progress towards our 5 launches in 5 years goal. Recent achievements include: the VX-147 or Inaxaplin pivotal trial remains on track to complete the Phase IIB portion of the study by the end of this year. In our type 1 diabetes program, both VX-880, the naked cells and VX-264, the cells plus device programs are now in the clinic and dosing patients. Additionally, we announced a strategic long-term manufacturing agreement with Lonza for our type 1 diabetes cell therapy programs.And finally, an accelerated time line for the VX-548 Phase II study in peripheral neuropathic pain, where we now expect the study to complete by the end of 2023. In total, we're advancing programs in 8 disease areas through mid- and late-stage development, 6 of which are now past the proof-of-concept stage as detailed on Slide 5. Beyond our clinical pipeline, we're also advancing the next wave of research stage assets, reflecting programs sourced from both internal and external innovation. This includes programs in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy type 1, the NaV1.7 program for pain and gentler conditioning agents for use with exa-cel. In the CF franchise, in R&amp;D and across the business, this quarter, Vertex has continued to make meaningful advancements to bring our CFTR portfolio to more patients around the globe and bring additional first-in-class or best-in-class potentially transformative medicines to multiple new disease areas.With that overview, I'll turn to the details of recent R&amp;D progress, starting with CF. While TRIKAFTA delivers tremendous benefit for patients. If it's possible to do better, we're committed to being the ones who do so and that is the goal for our next-in-class vanzacaftor triple combination therapy. I am pleased to share we expect to complete all 3 Phase III studies, SKYLINE 102 and 103 in patients ages 12 years and above and the RIDGELINE study in patients ages 6 to 11 by the end of 2023 and release results from these 3 studies in early '24. We have high expectations from the vanzacaftor triple program to lead to further improvements in CFTR function based on the totality of the evidence generated to date. The most direct readout of higher CFTR function is chloride transport in vitro and sweat chloride in patients.In vitro, our human bronchial epithelial cell assays with the vanzacaftor triple showed greater restoration of chloride transport than with TRIKAFTA. And in Phase II in patients the vanzacaftor triple clinical studies showed correspondingly lower levels of sweat chloride than in previous studies with TRIKAFTA. We, therefore, believe the vanzacaftor triple has the potential to provide patients with enhanced clinical benefit, the convenience of once-daily dosing. And additionally, the Vanza Triple carries a substantially lower royalty burden. Another important program in our CF portfolio is VX-522, our CFTR mRNA therapy in development with our partners at Moderna for the more than 5,000 CF patients who cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. We have enthusiasm for this approach for 3 key reasons, based on what we've achieved to date: first, the delivery of mRNA at high efficiency into HBE cells in vitro; second, expression of CFTR protein leading to high levels of chloride transport; and third, successful nebulize delivery of mRNA in both small and large animals resulting an expression of CFTR protein in the desired cells.We continue to enroll and dose CF patients in the single ascending dose or SAD study of VX-522. And we expect to complete the SAD portion and initiate the multiple ascending dose portion of the study this year. Turning now to exa-cel, our CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing program for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia which targets the most severe patients and an estimated patient population of approximately 32,000. Exa-cel holds the promise to be a onetime functional cure for these diseases. On the regulatory front, the FDA has accepted our filings and granted priority review in sickle cell disease with the December 8 PDUFA date. Along with a standard review in beta-thalassemia with the March 30, 2024 PDUFA date. The FDA has indicated an advisory committee will be held and we look forward to the opportunity to discuss the high unmet need, share results from the exa-cel studies and discuss the transformative potential exa-cel holds for patients.Outside the U.S., in the EU and the U.K., reviews for our exa-cel filings are also well underway. Our oral presentation, the most recent EHA meeting in June, provided new data that were the basis of the EMA and MHRA regulatory filings. Both trials met the primary and key secondary endpoints with follow-up in some patients of more than 36 months. The exa-cel EHA results continue to demonstrate transformative, consistent and durable benefit for patients as measured by freedom from severe vaso-occlusive crises for 94% of SCD patients and transfusion independence in 89% of TDT patients. The safety profile was generally consistent with busulfan conditioning and bone marrow transplantation. Another significant opportunity for exa-cel is in younger patients and the pediatric trials in both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia are underway.We have enrolled more than half the target number of patients in both pediatric studies and have dosed multiple patients. This is an important area of focus given the opportunity to intervene earlier and potentially prevent organ damage and other complications before they ever occur. As the PDUFA dates approach in the U.S. and reviews come to conclusion in the U.K. and EU, we look forward to bringing this onetime potentially curative therapy to thousands of patients with severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. Turning next to our pain program and VX-548, our novel, highly selective NaV1.8 inhibitor that holds the promise of effective pain relief without the side effects or addictive properties of opioids. In acute pain, I am pleased to share that all 3 Phase III studies, 2 randomized controlled trials and a single-arm safety and efficacy study will complete by the end of this year, with results available in late 2023 or early '24.The pace of this Phase III program has been rapid which we see as indicative of the high unmet need and strong interest in an efficacious, non-opioid acute pain therapy. We have high confidence in the outlook for these Phase III studies given: one, the genetic and pharmacologic validation of the target; two, multiple proof-of-concept trials with the predecessor molecule and with VX-548 itself; and three, the similar methodology, design and endpoints of our Phase III studies compared to the Phase II program. Closing on acute pain, recall that the phase III program has been designed to support a broad model-to-severe acute pain level which would enable prescribing and usage across mule setting including in Hospital or the ambulatory surgical center post-discharge and in the home.We are also studying VX-548 in diabetic peripheral neuropathy or DPN. A type of peripheral neuropathic pain that represents yet another significant area of unmet need and another multibillion-dollar market opportunity. We have previously delivered positive proof-of-concept data in peripheral neuropathic pain with the predecessor molecule VX-150. The current study in DPN with VX-548 is a 12-week Phase II dose-ranging proof-of-concept study. I am pleased to share the time line for this DPN study has accelerated and we have recently completed enrollment. This study will complete by the end of this year and we expect to share results in late 2023 or early '24. Moving now to type 1 diabetes, where we're evaluating stem cell-derived, fully differentiated insulin-producing islet cells for people with type 1 diabetes.Our goal is to develop a functional cure for the millions of people living with type 1 diabetes, including the more than 2.5 million patients in North America and Europe alone. The VX-880 program is our foundational cell therapy program for T1D in which we have already demonstrated proof of concept. In the VX-880 trial or the naked cell program, patients take standard immunosuppressants to protect the islets from the immune system. We presented updated clinical data on Parts A and B of the study at the recent American Diabetes Association Meeting. The presentation at the ADA showed that all 6 patients treated with VX-880 engrafted islet cells, produced endogenous insulin and had improved glycemic control while reducing or eliminating exogenous insulin use.Importantly, the 2 patients with at least 1 year follow-up saw a complete elimination of severe hypoglycemic events, maintained hemoglobin A1Cs below 7% and were insulin independent. Further, patients who were earlier on their course of therapy were on a similar trajectory as the 2 patients with long-term follow-up. Based on these results, the VX-880 trial has now advanced to Part C, where patients are treated concurrently at the full target dose. And as part of our global study plan, we've now opened clinical trial sites in Europe in addition to those already open in the U.S. and Canada. Our second program, VX-264, the cells plus device program encapsulates these same cells which have already demonstrated proof of concept in a proprietary immunoprotective device.And hence, there is no requirement for immunosuppressants. I am pleased to share that enrollment in the VX-264 study has initiated and we have already dosed the first patient. The third program is our hyperimmune program in which we edit the same fully differentiated cells to cloak them from the immune system. This represents another path to obviating the need for immunosuppressants. In March, we expanded our collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics into type 1 diabetes to use CRISPR/Cas9 to make these edits and we continue to make progress in this research stage program. Transitioning now to Inaxaplin or VX-147, the first potential medicine to target the underlying cause of APOL1-mediated kidney disease or AMKD, a genetically defined disease that affects approximately 100,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe alone.Recall the Inaxaplin pivotal program for patients with AMKD is a single adaptive Phase II/III study with a pathway to accelerate approval in the U.S. The Phase IIB dose-ranging portion of the study continues to enroll and dose and remains on track to complete this year. We also continue to work to enhance AMKD disease awareness and genetic testing availability to support diagnosis, including through partnerships with Natera, a leader in genetic testing and Arkana, a leader in renal pathology services. To close an update on our Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency or AATD program, our small molecule approach targets both the lung and liver manifestations of this disease that affects an estimated 100,000 people in North America and Europe. Our program is exploring 2 hypotheses: first, longer treatment duration with VX-864; and second, a more potent molecule with VX-634.The Phase II program for VX-864, a 48-week study in patients with AATD that assesses both liver clearance of Z polymer and functional plasma AAT levels is ongoing and is anticipated to complete enrollment later this year. VX-634, the next-in-class molecule with multifold greater potency and better drug-like properties is projected to complete its Phase I trial by the end of this year. Overall, the AATD program remains on track and we look forward to sharing results in 2024. With that, I'll turn it over to Stuart to provide a commercial update, including details on our launch preparations for exa-cel.Science, biotechlouis-reed-pwcKF7L4-no-unsplashStuart Arbuckle: Thanks, Reshma. From a commercial perspective, we had strong second quarter results as we continue our focus on reaching all patients eligible for our CFTR modulators and maintaining high levels of adherence for patients treated with our medicines. In addition, we continue to prepare for multiple potential near-term launches, including exa-cel in severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia VX-548 in moderate to severe acute pain and the vanzacaftor triple combination in CF. At the same time, we are developing new capabilities to support the commercialization of other pipeline assets. such as disease awareness for AMKD and investing in our manufacturing capabilities for type 1 diabetes.Given our nearest term opportunity is exa-cel in hemoglobinopathies where we have completed our regulatory filings in Europe and the U.S. and also being granted PDUFA dates in the U.S. This quarter, I will focus my comments about our pipeline on prelaunch activities for exa-cel. But briefly first on CF. At the beginning of this year, there were more than 20,000 people with CF in North America, Europe and Australia, who could benefit but were not yet being treated with a CFTR modulator. We continue to bring our medicines to these patients through new approvals and uptake following additional reimbursements with a focus on reaching younger patients and this will continue to be a driver of near-term growth for our business. Second quarter 2023 CF revenue growth of 14% was consistent with this outlook and was driven primarily by expanded use of our medicines in younger age groups.Following U.S. TRIKAFTA approval in children ages 2 to 5 in late April, we've seen strong interest from the CF community with the first prescription written just hours after the approval and uptake across all eligible patients. Outside the U.S., KAFTRIO growth has continued to be strong in patient ages 16 and older, following approval, reimbursement and successful launches in multiple geographies. In addition, we received EU approval for ORKAMBI in children ages 1 to 2 in early July and we continue to expect approval for KAFTRIO in the EU in children ages 2 to 5 by the end of this year. We are also actively enrolling our KAFTRIO study in children ages 1 to 2. Overall, we see continued growth for our portfolio of CFTR modulators, driven by approvals, reimbursement and uptake of our medicines in younger patients.In addition, approvals of future CF medicines will also drive growth. Notably, our next-generation vanzacaftor triple seeks to provide improved efficacy for patients and a new treatment option for those who have discontinued prior CFTR modulator therapy. And longer term, VX-522, our mRNA approach could offer a therapy for the more than 5,000 patients who cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. Shifting now to exa-cel which holds curative potential for patients with severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia both chronic diseases that can be disabling and life-shortening and have an extremely high burden of care. On previous quarterly earnings calls, I provided details for exa-cel on the estimated eligible patient population, the geographic concentration of those patients and our proposed ATC network of 50 centers in the U.S. and 25 in Europe.The hiring and training of our field and medical education teams and insights from physician and patient market research. This quarter, I'd like to provide our perspective on access and reimbursement and our discussions globally with payers and policymakers. Our teams continue to make excellent progress in pre-approval discussions with both government and commercial payers in the U.S. and Europe. With more than a dozen cell and gene therapies on the market, payers across different channels are increasingly experienced with these transformative types of therapies. In the U.S., approximately 65% of patients with sickle cell disease or beta thalassemia, have coverage through government programs with the majority via Medicaid and the remaining 35% of patients are covered by private insurance.Our teams have already engaged Medicaid administrators in all 50 states with a particular focus on the 24 states with the highest prevalence of sickle cell disease, accounting for an estimated 90% of Medicaid patients with SCD. We're encouraged by the enthusiasm from state Medicaid administrators for exa-cel as well as the proactive steps they are taking to prepare for the availability of therapies like exa-cel including the enablement of separate payment policies for coverage of the cost of the therapy, distinct from the cost of the bone marrow transplant procedure. The Medicaid-focused CMS cell and gene therapy access model also continues to make progress towards its anticipated launch in 2026. The model is clear evidence of the federal government's recognition of the potential transformative value of gene therapies like exa-cel to treat sickle cell disease and their interest in finding innovative payment solutions and pathways for state Medicaid programs.Shifting to commercial payers. We have had high levels of engagement with commercial payers, including the top 4 payers that account for approximately 80% of commercial lives. And our goal is to facilitate timely coverage decisions upon a potential exa-cel approval. Our pre-approval discussions have been encouraging and are focused on disease burden, epidemiology estimates, our clinical data and potential payment models. In Europe, the MAA reviews are well underway and thus, we are also working on paving the way to secure reimbursed access for patients in our targeted European markets. We have been engaging with health systems to educate them on the significant disease burden on patients, health care systems and society. In addition, we have been meeting with European health authorities to understand their interest in different payment models and to communicate the holistic value of a onetime potential functional cure.Given the urgent unmet need for new treatments for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia, there is significant interest from patients and physicians, particularly in geographies with high concentrations of the eligible patient population. To conclude, it's a remarkable time to be at Vertex. We continue to make progress treating more CF patients while our excitement for the transformative promise of exa-cel for patients and the resulting multibillion-dollar market opportunity continues to grow as we approach potential approval. We are also preparing for multiple additional near-term launches, including the vanzacaftor triple in CF and VX-548 in acute pain, both of which have the potential to dramatically improve patients' lives. I'll now turn the call over to Charlie to review the financials.Charlie Wagner: Thanks, Stuart. Vertex's excellent results in the second quarter of 2023 demonstrate once again our consistent strong performance and attractive growth profile. Second quarter 2023 revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $2.49 billion. Growth was led by a 26% year-over-year increase outside the U.S. on continued strong uptake of TRIKAFTA-KAFTRIO in markets with recently achieved reimbursement as well as label extensions in younger age groups. Similarly, expansion in younger age groups helped drive 7% U.S. revenue growth following the recent FDA approval of TRIKAFTA in patients ages 2 to 5. Second quarter and first half revenues also benefited from increases in channel inventory in certain international markets which are expected to draw down in the second half.Second quarter 2023 combined non-GAAP R&amp;D, acquired IP R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses were $1.04 billion compared to $750 million in the second quarter of 2022. Q2 2023 results include $110 million of acquired IP R&amp;D charges compared to $62 million of such charges in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter 2023 IP R&amp;D expense reflects a $70 million milestone to CRISPR Therapeutics for progress made in our hypoimmune program for type 1 diabetes. Aside from our investments in external innovation and the resulting higher acquired IP R&amp;D charges, operating expense growth was driven as expected by continued investment in research and our advancing pipeline which includes mid- and late-stage clinical assets across 8 different disease areas. The most significant areas of increased investment versus prior year included the clinical studies for the vanzacaftor Triple-NCF for VX-548 in acute pain and for type 1 diabetes.In addition, we continued our pre-commercial activities for exa-cel and other anticipated near-term launches, given the potentially transformative benefits to patients and multibillion-dollar market opportunities for our mid- and late-stage programs, we will continue to invest appropriately. Second quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating income was $1.15 billion compared to $1.19 billion in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.89, representing 8% growth compared to $3.60 in the second quarter of 2022. We ended the quarter with $12.6 billion in cash and investments. Now switching to guidance. Given our strong first half results and our consistent execution, including the successful launch of TRIKAFTA in patients ages 2 to 5 in the U.S., we are increasing our 2023 revenue guidance as detailed on Slide number 16, for the full year 2023, we now expect CF net product revenue of $9.7 billion to $9.8 billion, an increase of $100 million to $150 million compared to our prior range of $9.55 billion to $9.7 billion.Note that this revenue guidance includes an expected approximate 150 percentage point headwind to our revenue growth rate, consistent with our prior expectations. In addition, given our December 8 U.S. PDUFA date for exa-cel and sickle cell disease, 2023 product revenue guidance continues to reflect revenue from cystic fibrosis products only. We are also raising our 2023 guidance for combined non-GAAP R&amp;D, acquired IP R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses to a range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion, an increase of $200 million from prior guidance. This increase reflects higher IP R&amp;D expenses from new business development, including collaborations with Entrada in DM1 and with CRISPR in type 1 diabetes. Our 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance now includes approximately $500 million of upfronts and milestones compared to the $300 million projected at the start of the year.We continue to invest a majority of our operating expenses into R&amp;D, given the momentum in our multiple mid- and late-stage clinical development programs. We are also funding the expansion of our commercial capabilities in anticipation of the multibillion dollar opportunities represented by our programs with near-term launch potential while continuing to leverage an attractive business model afforded by our focus in specialty markets. Our guidance for projected full year 2023 non-GAAP effective tax rate of 21% to 22% is unchanged. In closing, Vertex delivered excellent results for the second quarter of 2023. We delivered strong revenue growth, completed important regulatory milestones, updated on significant clinical trial programs and invested internally and externally.As we continue to advance our programs in 2023, we anticipate further important milestones as highlighted on Slide 17 to mark our continued progress in multiple disease areas. We look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls and I'll ask Susie to begin the Q&amp;A period.Susie Lisa: Thanks, Charlie.

Total revenues rose 14% year over year, primarily driven by higher international sales of Trikafta (marketed as Kaftrio in Europe).Quarter in DetailThe company markets four CF products — Trikafta/Kaftrio, Symdeko (marketed as Symkevi in Europe), Orkambi and Kalydeco.CF product sales rose 7% year over year in the United States to $1.51 billion, while sales outside the United States surged 26% to $985 million.Trikafta generated sales worth $2.24 billion, up 18.3% year over year. The upside was driven by the strong uptake in international markets and expanded use (aged between two and five years) in children with CFin the United States. Trikafta sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $2.17 billion and $2.15 billion, respectively.Sales from other CF products, namely Symdeko/Symkevi, Kalydeco and Orkambi, were down 16.6% year over year to $252.8 million. Sales of these drugs were hurt by patients switching to Trikafta.Costs RiseAdjusted research and development (R&amp;D) expenses rose 37.6% from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $708.4 million due to the expansion of the company’s mid- and late-stage pipeline.Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses increased 26.7% to $219.6 million in the reported quarter due to expenses for CF launches and pre-commercial activities for exa-cel.During the fourth quarter, Vertex recorded acquired IPR&amp;D costs of $110.5 million compared with $61.9 million in the year-ago quarter.Story continuesRaises 2023 GuidanceBased on the solid uptake of Trikafta/Kaftrio observed worldwide, Vertex raised its 2023 guidance. Management expects total revenues from CF products in the range of $9.7-$9.8 billion compared with the prior expectation of $9.55-$9.70 billion. The raised guidance for 2023 suggests a 9-10% year-over-year growth,For the full year, management expects to record adjusted combined R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses in the band of $4.1-$4.2 billion compared with the previous guidance of $3.9-$4.0 billion. This upside can be attributed to increased IPR&amp;D expenses following new business developments in the non-CF pipeline.The adjusted tax rate is expected in the range of 21-22% (maintained).Shares were up in the after-market trading on Aug 1, post the earnings announcement. This was due to the increased guidance and better-than-expected earnings results.In the year so far, the stock has risen 20.4% against the industry’s 11.3% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPipeline &amp; Other UpdatesApart from CF, Vertex is rapidly advancing its mid- and late-stage pipeline which comprises candidates across eight indications. Six of the programs are past the proof-of-concept stage.Vertex is co-developing gene-editing treatment exagamglogene autotemcel (“exa-cel”), in partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics CRSP targeting two devastating diseases — transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD). This June, Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics announced that the FDA accepted the biologics license application (BLA) submissions seeking approval for exa-cel in SCD and TDT indications and a final decision is expected by Dec 8, 2023, and Mar 30, 2024, respectively. CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex have filed similar regulatory submissions for exa-cel in Europe, which were validated this January. Management expects the CRSP-partnered exa-cel to be its next commercial launch.Vertex continues to enroll study participants in the ongoing pivotal phase III study evaluating its non-opioid NaV1.8 inhibitor VX-548 as a potential treatment for moderate to severe acute pain following bunionectomy or abdominoplasty surgery. Management expects to complete the pivotal studies before this year’s end. VX-548 is also being evaluated in a mid-stage study in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a form of peripheral neuropathic pain. Data from all these studies are expected by late 2023 or early 2024.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated PriceVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated price | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderVertex currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the overall healthcare sector include Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ and Novartis NVS, carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

Multi-family starts were down to 138 units from 147 units reported a year ago.Adjusted EBITDA of $93 million was down from the prior-year quarter’s level of $491 million.Segmental AnalysisSiding: The segment’s sales of $320 million were down 10% from the prior-year period, with a decline of 11% in Siding Solutions’ (formerly known as SmartSide) revenues to $318 million. A 6% rise in the average net selling price (ASP) was offset by a 16% decrease in volume from prior-year levels. The average net selling price benefited from list price increases. Volume reduced on challenging new and existing home selling markets and elevated levels of channel inventory compared with the prior periods.Adjusted EBITDA came in at $59 million, a 24% decline from $78 million reported a year ago. Reduced net sales, raw material inflation and discretionary investments in capacity and sales &amp; marketing impacted adjusted EBITDA.OSB: Sales in the segment decreased 66% year over year to $229 million, owing to lower OSB prices, a decrease in sales volume from production curtailments and a decline related to production volume from the conversion of its Sagola, MI, mill to siding production.The company’s adjusted EBITDA fell 91% year over year to $37 million due to lower prices and sales volumes, partially offset by lower mill-related costs.South America: Sales of $53 million declined 25% due to lower OSB volumes and ASP. Adjusted EBITDA fell 52% from the year-ago quarter to $13 million due to lower revenues and higher raw material costs.Story continuesFinancialsAs of Jun 30, 2023, Louisiana-Pacific had cash and cash equivalents of $71 million compared with $369 million at 2022-end.

Ingersoll Rand believes Organic Revenue Growth is a helpful supplemental measure to assist management and investors in evaluating the Company’s operating results as it excludes the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions on revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain non-cash, non-recurring and other adjustment items. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income including interest, depreciation and amortization of non-acquisition related intangible assets and excluding other items used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA and further adjusted for the tax effect of these exclusions. Organic Revenue Growth is defined as As Reported Revenue growth less the impacts of Foreign Currency and Acquisitions. Ingersoll Rand believes that the adjustments applied in presenting Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items and about non-recurring items that the Company does not expect to continue at the same level in the future. Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by Adjusted Diluted Average Shares Outstanding. Incrementals/Decrementals are defined as the change in Adjusted EBITDA versus the prior year period divided by the change in revenue versus the prior year period.Ingersoll Rand uses Free Cash Flow to review the liquidity of its operations. Ingersoll Rand measures Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures. Ingersoll Rand believes Free Cash Flow is a useful supplemental financial measures for management and investors in assessing the Company’s ability to pursue business opportunities and investments and to service its debt. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of our liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities.Management and Ingersoll Rand’s board of directors regularly use these measures as tools in evaluating the Company’s operating and financial performance and in establishing discretionary annual compensation. Such measures are provided in addition to, and should not be considered to be a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable measures under GAAP. In addition, Ingersoll Rand believes that Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Incrementals/Decrementals and Free Cash Flow are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers, many of which also present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, and Free Cash Flow when reporting their results in an effort to facilitate an understanding of their operating and financial results and liquidity.Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as alternatives to revenue growth, net income, diluted earnings per share or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Free Cash Flow have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing Ingersoll Rand’s results as reported under GAAP.Reconciliations of Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Free Cash Flow to their most comparable U.S. GAAP financial metrics for historical periods are presented in the tables below.Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures related to full-year 2023 guidance have not been provided due to the unreasonable efforts it would take to provide such reconciliations due to the high variability, complexity and uncertainty with respect to forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including net income (loss) and adjustments that could be made for acquisitions-related expenses, restructuring and other business transformation costs, gains or losses on foreign currency exchange and the timing and magnitude of other amounts in the reconciliation of historic numbers. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.INGERSOLL RAND INC.

This $29 million decrease was driven by lower revenues from decreased customer consumption attributable primarily to milder weather in the quarter, lower revenues from the transmission component of new base rates, higher costs associated with additional investments (primarily depreciation and borrowing costs) and higher operation and maintenance expense, partially offset by higher revenues from the distribution component of new base rates, higher revenues from updates to transmission billing factors, and higher revenues from customer growth. The new base rates went into effect on May 1, 2023 and implemented the terms of the final order issued by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (""PUCT"") in Oncor's comprehensive base rate review (""PUCT Docket No. 53601"").Oncor. (PRNewsFoto/Oncor)""We are pleased to announce another quarter characterized by impressive growth and robust operational performance. These achievements underscore our critical role in supporting Texas' economic advancement. With a strong emphasis on resiliency, reliability and grid modernization, we feel that we are well-prepared to meet the increasing electricity demand across the ERCOT market and adapt to the evolving energy landscape. We believe our strategic investments in grid infrastructure, coupled with our dedication to customer satisfaction, have positioned us well for continued success. In addition, we feel that the passage of several key bills during the Texas regular legislative session will help set the stage for a safer, more reliable and more resilient electric grid, offering substantial benefits for our stakeholders in the future,"" said Oncor CEO Allen Nye.""During another summer of blistering heat, our employees have continued to provide safe, reliable and affordable electric service."" Nye continued, ""Their unwavering dedication has been instrumental in working towards meeting the needs of our customers, our state and the ERCOT market.""Story continuesOncor's reported net income of $303 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared unfavorably to net income of $423 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022. This $120 million decrease was driven by the write-off of rate base disallowances recorded in the first quarter of 2023 resulting from the final order in PUCT Docket No. 53601, lower revenues from decreased customer consumption attributable primarily to milder weather in the first half of the year, lower revenues from the transmission component of new base rates, higher costs associated with additional investments (primarily depreciation and borrowing costs) and higher operation and maintenance expense, partially offset by higher revenues from updates to transmission billing factors, higher revenues from the distribution component of new base rates and higher revenues from customer growth.Oncor's total distribution base revenues in the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 increased 2.3% (7.5% increase on a weather-normalized basis). The change in Oncor's total distribution base revenues in the second quarter of 2023 included a 3.0% increase in distribution base revenues from residential customers (14.5% increase on a weather-normalized basis) and a 3.4% increase in distribution base revenues from large commercial and industrial customers. Oncor's total distribution base revenues in the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022 decreased 1.1% (4.7% increase on a weather-normalized basis). The change in Oncor's total distribution base revenues in the six months ended June 30, 2023 included a 4.7% decrease in distribution base revenues from residential customers (7.2% increase on a weather-normalized basis) and a 4.2% increase in distribution base revenues from large commercial and industrial customers. Financial and operational results are provided in Tables A, B, C, and D below.Regulatory and Legislative UpdatesAs previously announced, in April 2023, the PUCT issued a final order in the comprehensive base rate review Oncor filed in May 2022 with the PUCT and the cities in Oncor's service territory that have retained original jurisdiction over rates. New base rates implementing the terms of the final order took effect on May 1, 2023. Oncor and other intervening parties in the proceeding filed motions for rehearing with respect to various provisions of the final order, and on June 30, 2023, the PUCT issued an order on rehearing in response to those motions for rehearing. The order on rehearing made certain technical and typographical corrections to the final order, but otherwise affirmed the material provisions of the final order and did not require modification of the rates that went into effect May 1, 2023.On June 29, 2023, Oncor filed an application for an interim distribution cost recovery factor (""DCRF"") rate adjustment for recovery of certain distribution investments that went into service in 2022. Oncor estimates that the requested interim DCRF rate adjustment would result in a $153 million annual revenue impact. In addition, on July 25, 2023, Oncor filed an application for an interim transmission cost of service (""TCOS"") rate adjustment, which Oncor estimates would result in an annual revenue impact of $42 million.  During its 2023 regular session, the Texas Legislature passed various legislation impacting the electric industry, which Oncor anticipates could have a significant positive impact on its business, particularly through reduction of regulatory lag and increased regulatory certainty regarding recovery of certain costs, including Senate Bill 1015, Senate Bill 1016 and House Bill 2555, which have all been enacted into law.Senate Bill 1015 allows utilities to file up to two DCRF interim rate update applications each year at any time during the year (with certain exceptions if a base rate proceeding is pending) and shortens the administrative process for the proceedings to 60 days. The legislation also permits filing an application during a base rate proceeding, provided that filing is made 185 days after the commencement of the base rate proceeding.Senate Bill 1016 creates a presumption that employee compensation and benefit expenses (other than pension, other post-retirement employee benefits or certain incentive compensation for officers) are reasonable and necessary if the expenses are consistent with market compensation studies issued within three years of the rate proceeding.House Bill 2555 authorizes an electric utility, following rulemaking proceedings by the PUCT, to file for approval of a plan to increase the resiliency of its transmission and distribution system and provides recovery options for certain of those costs, including through deferral to regulatory assets.Other state legislation enacted recently that could impact Oncor's business and operations includes legislation reducing property taxes, legislation shortening the time period for certain approvals relating to transmission projects, legislation expanding and clarifying the uses of mobile generation leased by utilities during power outages and legislation directing the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (""ERCOT"") and the PUCT to develop plans for transmission projects to serve certain high growth areas of the state, including the Permian Basin.Growth Within Oncor's Service Territory In the three months ended June 30, 2023, Oncor continued to experience solid growth in premises and the construction of new transmission and distribution lines, all while remaining focused on safety and reliability.Oncor continues to support Texas' population growth with new projects, including projects designed to increase reliability for ERCOT market. On the distribution side, Oncor connected 21,000 new premises to the ERCOT grid in the second quarter of 2023, as compared to 19,000 in the second quarter of 2022. Oncor also constructed or upgraded approximately 575 miles of distribution lines. On the transmission side, Oncor placed nearly $560 million of projects into service in the second quarter of 2023 as compared to nearly $240 million in the second quarter of 2022. These projects included constructing or upgrading approximately 115 miles of transmission lines, and placing into service 22 switching stations and 18 load-serving substations.At June 30, 2023, Oncor had approximately 720 active generation and retail transmission point-of-interconnection (""POI"") requests in queue, representing a 37% increase as compared to active generation and retail transmission POI requests in queue at June 30, 2022. Of the approximately 440 active generation POI requests in queue at June 30, 2023, 48% are solar, 41% are storage, 8% are wind and 3% are gas. In the three months ended June 30, 2023, Oncor entered 92 new generation and retail transmission POI requests into queue as compared to the 90 new generation and retail transmission POI requests that were entered during the same period in 2022.Operational HighlightsFor the industry's primary benchmark for reliability, System Average Interruption Duration Index (non-storm), Oncor continued to improve in the twelve months ended period June 30, 2023 as compared to the prior year period. On average, Oncor's customers experienced ten fewer minutes of outage over the period – an improvement of approximately 13%. Oncor has undertaken various efforts to enhance reliability, including automation and system hardening projects, particularly in its planning for severe weather events.In June 2023, Oncor released its fourth annual Corporate Sustainability Overview, which is available on Oncor's website at oncor.com under the Investor Relations section. 2023 Capital Expenditure BudgetIn July 2023, Oncor's board of directors increased the company's 2023 capital expenditure budget from $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion due primarily to continued projected growth in Oncor's service territory, increases in the cost of materials and increased labor and contractor costs. Oncor expects those trends to continue to impact capital expenditures for 2023 and beyond.LiquidityAs of August 2, 2023, Oncor's available liquidity, consisting of cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under its accounts receivable facility (""AR Facility""), credit facility and commercial paper program totaled $2.0 billion. Oncor expects cash flows from operations combined with long-term debt issuances and term loan credit agreements, as well as availability under its AR Facility, credit facility and commercial paper program to be sufficient to fund current obligations, projected working capital requirements, maturities of long-term debt and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.Sempra Internet Broadcast TodaySempra (NYSE: SRE) (BMV: SRE) will broadcast a live discussion of its earnings results over the Internet today at 12 p.m. ET, which will include discussion of second quarter 2023 results and other information relating to Oncor.

(SDGE) and Southern California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) are making critical investments in energy networks to better serve customers, continue to improve operational safety and reliability and help drive electrification and decarbonization across multiple sectors of the state's economy.Story continuesSDGE was awarded an estimated $500 million of planned transmission projects to support reliability as part of the California Independent System Operator's (CAISO) final 2022-2023 transmission plan. In June, CAISO also initiated a competitive bidding process for several transmission projects to help ensure California can meet growth and future energy demand and add renewable generation to its system, with $2.3 billion of those projects located within SDGE's service territory. In addition, to further bolster reliability and help CAISO store and dispatch clean energy to meet peak demand, SDGE began operations at two new utility-owned energy storage facilities totaling 171 megawatts (MW). SDGE expects to grow its energy storage portfolio to 345 MW by the end of the year — enough to meet more than 15% of its customers' energy demand on a typical day.Additionally, it is important to note that the utility market in California continues to evolve. In SDGE's service territory, for example, more than 80% of its customers in San Diego County are now procuring their electricity supplies from third parties, which has the benefit of allowing the company to focus primarily on developing and operating modern energy networks that more efficiently integrate renewable resources, battery storage, electric vehicle charging stations and other clean technologies. Moreover, SDGE's narrower focus on energy delivery and connecting producers of cleaner energy to customers directly supports the transition to a lower carbon energy system and the state's overall public policy goals.At SoCalGas, the focus remains on safety and affordably supporting reliability and decarbonization using its existing energy network. In connection with Senate Bill 1440, the utility recently launched a request for offers to procure renewable natural gas (RNG) and bio-synthetic natural gas from eligible suppliers. These actions are being taken in accordance with state-mandated targets for approximately 12% utility procurement of biomethane supply from landfills, woody biomass and other agricultural sources by 2030. In 2022, SoCalGas was successful in achieving 5% RNG penetration in core gas deliveries. This supports SoCalGas' goal of reaching 20% RNG throughput for core customers by 2030. The company also released an update to its 2021 Clean Fuels Study, which indicates that meeting the state's decarbonization and reliability goals will require critical new infrastructure investments to facilitate the delivery of cleaner fuels, a considerable scale-up of renewable generation resources and up to 10 gigawatts of electricity fueled by clean hydrogen by 2045.The California Public Utilities Commission continues to advance the ongoing general rate cases of SDGE and SoCalGas, which focus on delivering cleaner energy, safely and reliably, in alignment with California's sustainability goals. The proposed decision is expected to be issued in the second quarter of 2024 with rates to be retroactively effective to January 1 of that year.Sempra TexasIn Texas, the 2023 state legislative session closed out with the enactment of several energy reform measures that are expected to strengthen grid resiliency and facilitate new energy infrastructure development across the state. Moreover, the new laws are expected to help improve regulatory certainty regarding recovery of certain utility investments, reduce regulatory lag and shorten certain administrative processing time, which is intended to streamline project development to support increasing demand for electrification and reliability. These positive legislative reforms, coupled with recent regulatory outcomes related to Oncor's base rate review at the Public Utility Commission of Texas, strengthen the company's ability to better serve customers and support critical system growth and expansion.To date, Oncor has made significant progress executing on its more than $19 billion, five-year capital budget, investing in critical transmission and distribution infrastructure projects to support population growth in Texas and increase reliability for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market. Throughout the quarter, Oncor continued to experience solid growth in new premises and the construction of new transmission and distribution lines, all while remaining focused on safety and reliability. In the second quarter, Oncor connected 21,000 new premises to the ERCOT grid, constructed or upgraded roughly 575 miles of distribution lines and placed nearly $560 million of projects into service. The company also had approximately 720 active generation and retail transmission point-of-interconnection (POI) requests in queue as of June 30, 2023.Sempra InfrastructureSempra Infrastructure remains on track to deliver strong financial performance for 2023 as it advances its three integrated business lines: clean power, energy networks and liquefied natural gas (LNG) and net-zero solutions.The company continues to advance its Pacific and Atlantic basin LNG supply strategy. Construction continues according to plan at the Energía Costa Azul LNG Phase 1 project located on the Pacific Coast, which has logged 8 million hours worked with no lost-time incidents and remains on track to reach commercial operations by summer of 2025.In the Atlantic basin, the company is making progress at its proposed Port Arthur energy hub, which is benefiting from the integrated development capabilities of its energy network and LNG business lines. Construction is underway at the Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project with more than 2.7 million hours of work completed, all without a lost-time incident.Notably, Sempra Infrastructure Partners, LP (Sempra Infrastructure) is announcing today that it expects to finalize its ownership stake in Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 at an indirect ownership of 28%, landing near the high end of the previously shared target ownership of 20% to 30%. The transaction is anticipated to close in the third quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions.Another critical component of the proposed Port Arthur energy hub is the development of the 72-mile Louisiana Connector pipeline, which is expected to deliver approximately 2 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas to Port Arthur LNG. Additionally, Sempra Infrastructure has acquired pore space for the proposed Titan Carbon Sequestration project, which is located nearby in Jefferson County, Texas, and is envisioned to capture carbon from the Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project under construction and potential future phases, as well as potentially from other entities.Finally, the competitive front-end engineering design process on the proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project continues. Cameron LNG JV recently informed Bechtel that it had been selected to perform additional value engineering work on the proposed Phase 2 project, and the parties are negotiating the terms and conditions for a definitive engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract. Sempra Infrastructure expects this process to continue through the fall, positioning the company to make a final investment decision in 2024 after executing the EPC contract and securing project financing and necessary regulatory approvals.Two-for-One Stock SplitSempra today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend. Each stockholder of record at the close of business on August 14, 2023 will receive one additional share of common stock for every then-held share of common stock, to be distributed after the close of trading on August 21, 2023. The company expects its common stock to begin trading at the split-adjusted price on August 22, 2023.The stock split is intended to make Sempra's common stock more accessible to a broader base of investors and to improve the overall trading volume of such shares due to the increased number of shares outstanding. The split-adjusted price offers an opportunity to appeal to new investors who want to join the company's mission to be North America's premier energy infrastructure company.Earnings GuidanceGiven the strength of the company's financial performance in the first half of this year, Sempra is updating its full-year 2023 GAAP earnings per common share (EPS) guidance range to $8.78 to $9.38 and affirming its full-year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range of $8.60 to $9.20. The company is also affirming its full-year 2024 EPS guidance range of $9.10 to $9.80 and its projected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%. The foregoing GAAP and adjusted EPS guidance ranges will be updated for the aforementioned stock split in the company's third quarter and full year 2023 financial results.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresNon-GAAP financial measures include Sempra's adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted EPS guidance range. See Table A for additional information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.Internet BroadcastSempra will broadcast a live discussion of its earnings results over the internet today at 12 p.m. ET with the company's senior management. Access is available by logging onto the Investors section of the company's website, sempra.com/investors.

This compares to earnings of $0.01 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -2,000%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this natural gas distributor would post earnings of $3.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.70, delivering a surprise of 6.02%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Spire , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Gas Distribution industry, posted revenues of $418.5 million for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.65%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $448 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Spire shares have lost about 9.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.2%.What's Next for Spire?While Spire has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Spire: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.92 on $303.42 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.27 on $2.68 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Gas Distribution is currently in the top 27% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Sempra (SRE), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on August 3.This natural gas and electricity provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.72 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.Sempra's revenues are expected to be $3.64 billion, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, some of the companies are likely to have gained from cost-saving initiatives and usage of new technologies that helped in increasing the reliability of their services and lowering operating and maintenance expenses.Per the latest Earnings Preview, the Zacks Utilities sector’s second-quarter earnings and revenues are expected to have declined 5.7% and 0.7%, respectively. While the capital-intensive utility stocks might have been impacted by the ongoing rise in interest rates, new rates implemented in their service territories and customer growth are likely to have boosted profits.Factors to NoteThe performance of capital-intensive domestic-focused utilities is expected to have been adversely impacted by an increase in interest rates as capital servicing costs rise substantially from the current levels.Except in the case of any major weather variation, demand for utility services remains more or less steady, regardless of economic cycles. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration report, mild weather conditions during the first half of 2023 are likely to have resulted in a 3% decline in electricity usage, year over year. Thus, mild weather might have adversely impacted utility earnings during the second quarter.However, Utilities continue to benefit from various favorable factors, such as new electric rates, customer additions, cost management and the implementation of energy-efficiency programs. Also, the ongoing investments to improve the resiliency of electric infrastructure against extreme weather conditions and the transition to cost-effective, renewable energy sources to produce electricity aid the power industry. Furthermore, the government is assisting in increasing the use of renewable energy through tax credits.The Inflation Reduction Act will support and accelerate the Utilities’ transition toward clean-energy sources. The Act has removed uncertainties related to federal incentives for the usage of renewable sources. It also entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way and is expected to boost earnings potential.According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

This compares to earnings of $1.93 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -15.25%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this chemical producer would post earnings of $1.73 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.77, delivering a surprise of 2.31%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.FMC , which belongs to the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry, posted revenues of $1.01 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.45%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.45 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.FMC shares have lost about 24.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.2%.What's Next for FMC?While FMC has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for FMC: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.38 on $1.28 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.39 on $5.26 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Chemical - Diversified is currently in the bottom 7% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, LyondellBasell (LYB), has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023.

Aggregates gross profit margin has expanded 230 basis points, and cash gross profit per ton has improved 23 percent to $8.98 per ton. Strong sales and operating momentum across our business is expected to carry through the rest of the year. Shipments have benefited from large industrial projects, and residential construction activity has been better than expected. As a result, we now expect to deliver full-year Adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 to $2.0 billion, an increase of $150 million compared to our initial expectations communicated in February.""Story continuesSegment ResultsAggregatesIn the second quarter, segment gross profit increased 24 percent to $499 million ($7.87 per ton), and gross profit margin expanded 290 basis points. This improvement resulted from strong pricing growth and improving efficiencies from our operating disciplines. Earnings improvement was widespread across the Company's footprint.Aggregates shipments decreased 1 percent with variations across geographies. Shipment activity in California was particularly strong, following the weather-impacted first quarter. Certain markets in the Southeast benefited from healthy shipment activity to industrial projects.The pricing environment remains positive across the Company's footprint. Freight-adjusted selling prices increased 15 percent, or $2.44 per ton, as compared to the prior year, with all markets realizing year-over-year improvement.Consistent with expectations, freight-adjusted unit cash cost of sales increased 8 percent, or $0.67 per ton, over the prior year. Persistent inflationary pressures for parts and supplies offset the benefit of lower diesel prices.Pricing momentum and solid operational execution drove a 22 percent improvement in cash gross profit per ton to $9.76 per ton in the second quarter. The Company remains focused on compounding improvements in unit profitability throughout the cycle through fixed cost leverage, price growth and operating efficiencies.Asphalt, Concrete and CalciumAsphalt segment gross profit was $57 million, an increase of $43 million over the prior year's second quarter, and gross profit margin continued to expand. Cash gross profit was $66 million versus $22 million in the prior year. The year-over-year improvement in earnings was driven by a combination of strong shipment growth, continued pricing momentum and lower liquid asphalt cost. Shipments increased 16 percent, benefiting from solid growth in Arizona and California, the Company's largest asphalt markets. Pricing increased 9 percent, or $6.10 per ton, with improvements across all markets.Concrete segment gross profit was $27 million, and cash gross profit was $47 million in the second quarter. Unit gross profit improved 22 percent, or $2.35 per cubic yard, despite lower shipments. Second quarter shipments were impacted by the prior year divestiture of the Company's operations in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and the slowdown in residential construction activity.Calcium segment gross profit was $1.1 million compared to $0.2 million in the prior year's second quarter.Selling, Administrative and General (SAG)SAG expense in the quarter was $139 million, or 6.6 percent of total revenues, a 30 basis points improvement versus the prior year. Trailing-twelve-months SAG expense was 6.8 percent of total revenues. The Company remains focused on further leveraging its overhead cost structure.Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital AllocationThrough the first half of the year, cash provided by operating activities was $508 million, a 56 percent increase from the comparable prior year period. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $157 million, including both maintenance and growth projects. Through the first half of 2023, capital expenditures were $270 million. As planned, the Company expects to spend $600 to $650 million for maintenance and growth projects in 2023. Additionally, the Company now expects to spend approximately $200 million on opportunistic land purchases for strategic reserves in California, North Carolina and Texas. During the quarter, the Company returned $57 million to shareholders through dividends, an 8 percent increase versus the prior year, and $50 million to shareholders through repurchases of common stock.On June 30, 2023, the ratio of total debt to trailing-twelve-months Adjusted EBITDA was 2.1 times (2.0 times on a net debt basis).On a trailing-twelve-months basis, return on average invested capital was 14.7 percent, a 110 basis points improvement over the prior year. The Company is focused on continuing to drive improvement through solid operating earnings growth coupled with disciplined capital management.OutlookRegarding the Company's full-year outlook for 2023, Mr. Hill stated, ""We are increasing our full-year earnings expectations to reflect aggregates shipment trends and the earnings momentum in our Asphalt segment. Through the first half of the year, shipments have been in line with the upper end of our original expectations. Private non-residential construction activity has remained healthy and should partially offset declines in residential activity which have been more moderate than anticipated. As a result, we are updating our aggregates volume outlook to reflect shipment levels through the first half. As always, we remain focused on the things we can control, and we are well positioned to navigate shifts in demand and deliver attractive earnings growth in 2023.""Management expectations for 2023 include the following updates:Aggregates shipments down 1 to 4 percent (236.3 million tons in 2022)Total Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium segment cash gross profit of approximately $295 millionNet earnings attributable to Vulcan of between $855 and $935 millionAdjusted EBITDA of between $1.9 and $2.0 billionAll other aspects of the Company's expectations for 2023 remain unchanged.Conference CallVulcan will host a conference call at 10:00 a.m. CT on August 3, 2023.

We present this metric as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. We believe that this presentation is consistent with our competitors and meaningful to our investors as it excludes revenues associated with freight &amp; delivery, which are pass-through activities. It also excludes other revenues related to services, such as landfill tipping fees, that are derived from our aggregates business. Additionally, we use this metric as the basis for calculating the average sales price of our aggregates products.

We use this metric to assess the operating performance of our business and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting as we believe that it closely correlates to long-term shareholder value. We do not use this metric as a measure to allocate resources. We adjust EBITDA for certain items to provide a more consistent comparison of earnings performance from period to period.

For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results. Appendix 3Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures (Continued)Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA is not a GAAP measure and should not be considered as an alternative to metrics defined by GAAP. We, the investment community and credit rating agencies use this metric to assess our leverage. Net debt subtracts cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash from total debt. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below: Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA(in millions)June 3020232022DebtCurrent maturities of long-term debt$0.5$0.5Short-term debt0.0176.0Long-term debt3,873.23,873.7Total debt$3,873.7$4,050.2Less: Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash168.2123.7Net debt$3,705.5$3,926.5Trailing-Twelve Months (TTM) Adjusted EBITDA$1,814.5$1,545.1Total debt to TTM Adjusted EBITDA 2.1x  2.6x Net debt to TTM Adjusted EBITDA 2.0x  2.5x  We define ""Return on Invested Capital"" (ROIC) as Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing-twelve months divided by average invested capital (as illustrated below) during the trailing 5-quarters. Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric EBITDA. We believe that our ROIC metric is meaningful because it helps investors assess how effectively we are deploying our assets. Although ROIC is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROIC. As a result, the method we use to calculate our ROIC may differ from the methods used by other companies. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP.

This compares to earnings of $0.59 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 18.33%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this construction materials producer would post a loss of $0.38 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.26, delivering a surprise of 31.58%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Summit Materials , which belongs to the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry, posted revenues of $680.37 million for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.88%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $631.92 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Summit Materials shares have added about 29% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.2%.What's Next for Summit Materials?While Summit Materials has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Summit Materials: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.76 on $706.69 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.51 on $2.3 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Additionally, sequential improvements in the residential market and recently increased remodeling activities are encouraging.Per the latest Earnings Outlook, the Q2 earnings season has seen releases from approximately 46.2% of the construction companies on the S&amp;P 500 Index. Of them, the sector’s total earnings are down 11.9% from the year-ago period on 3.5% higher revenues, with 100% beating earnings per share estimates and 83.3% beating revenue estimates.The construction sector earnings listed on the S&amp;P 500 Index are expected to decline 14.3% year over year in the to-be-reported quarter, compared with the 19.1% fall registered in first-quarter 2023. Revenues are projected to increase 3.4% year over year versus a rise of 2.8% recorded in the last reported quarter.What’s Driving the Sector?The rising demand for infrastructural activities for public project work is expected to have supported growth for the non-residential players. Strong global trends in infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security and a potential super-cycle in global supply-chain investments will have aided the sector. Increased fiber deployments in the telecommunications networks to provide gigabit network speeds to individual consumers and businesses using 5G technologies are likely to have acted as tailwinds for these companies’ quarterly performance.Other factors like favorable weather, prudent cost-saving efforts, a disciplined approach to bidding, project management, buyouts synergies and increased road repair and maintenance works are added positives.Although residential and remodelling markets are low year over year, they have improved sequentially. The desire to own a home amid a lack of existing homes for sale, focus on cost control, increased operating leverage and important buyouts will likely help the companies to partially offset accelerated mortgage rates, increased raw material and labor cost woes.These above-mentioned tailwinds are expected to have contributed to the quarterly performances of Quanta Services, Inc.

The top line missed the consensus mark by a whisker.The quarterly results suffered a blow due to elevated catastrophe losses, inducing weakness in its underwriting results. Higher claim frequency and an increased expense level also dampened Allstate’s performance in the second quarter.

REG is slated to report second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 3 after the closing bell. The company’s quarterly results are likely to display year-over-year revenue growth and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this Jacksonville, FL-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) reported a surprise of 5.88% in terms of NAREIT FFO per share. The results reflected a better-than-anticipated top line, aided by healthy leasing activity and a year-over-year improvement in the base rent.Over the trailing four quarters, the company’s FFO per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions, met once and missed in the remaining one, the average beat being 2.52%. This is depicted in the graph below:Regency Centers Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRegency Centers Corporation price-eps-surprise | Regency Centers Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayPer a report from CBRE Group CBRE, the demand for retail space in the second quarter of 2023 was subdued, with net absorption totaling 5.9 million square feet. This represented the lowest level of demand since the sector experienced a negative net absorption of 10.1 million square feet in the third quarter of 2020.However, on the brighter side, rent growth in the U.S. retail real estate market recommenced during the quarter. The overall average asking rent of $23.21 per square foot improved 0.6% quarter over quarter, marking the highest increase since the first quarter of 2022. Moreover, the figure improved 2.1% year over year. This growth was attributable to significant gains in Raleigh and various Florida markets, per the CBRE Group report.In addition, elevated construction costs and economic concerns resulted in historically low levels of construction completions. The second quarter’s overall availability rate declined 10 basis points (bps) to 4.8%, a record low.Amid this backdrop, Regency is anticipated to have capitalized on the post-pandemic migration trend and the hybrid work setup of people who are now shifting to suburban areas. As a result, demand for the company’s high-quality open-air shopping centers in the affluent suburban areas and near urban trade areas of the United States is likely to have remained robust, boosting occupancy levels and its cash flows.Moreover, this retail REIT’s portfolio comprises around 80% of the grocery-anchored neighborhood and community centers, which are necessity-driven by nature. It also enjoys a good tenant mix with several industry-leading grocers. This is expected to have led to stable rental revenue generation during the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $313.3 million, indicating an increase of 3.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.During the second quarter, Regency continued its accretive acquisitions and development activities to bolster its external growth. In May 2023, it entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc., a real estate investment trust that owns and operates retail properties in the suburban New York metropolitan area, in an all-stock transaction valued at roughly $1.4 billion. The merger is expected to enhance Regency's geographic diversification, tenant mix, growth prospects and balance sheet strength.The deal, which has been approved by both the companies' boards of directors, will create a combined portfolio of 481 properties with more than 56 million square feet of gross leasable area. For the combined entity, the enterprise value is estimated at $16 billion, with a pro forma equity market capitalization of around $11 billion.The company’s activities during the to-be-reported quarter were adequate to garner analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for REG’s second-quarter FFO per share has been revised a penny upward to $1.01 over the past two months. Moreover, the figure implies an improvement of 1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Nonetheless, the overall choppiness in the economy and high interest rates might have impeded the company’s performance to some extent.Story continuesQ2 DevelopmentsIn May 2023, Regency Centers, in partnership with Blumenfeld Development Group, announced its plan to revitalize the currently vacant SunVet Mall in Long Island, NY. The planned redevelopment involves transforming the site into a 168,000-square-foot, grocery-anchored, open-air shopping center, with the fourth Whole Foods Market in Suffolk County as the centerpiece.Earning WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Regency this season.

(NYSE:EL) A Top Quality Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boasting-16-return-equity-est-110024028.html,1691060424,STORY,['EL'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Estée Lauder Companies is:16% = US$1.1b ÷ US$6.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.16 in profit.Does Estée Lauder Companies Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Estée Lauder Companies has a higher ROE than the average (11%) in the Personal Products industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Estée Lauder Companies.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Estée Lauder Companies' Debt And Its 16% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Estée Lauder Companies, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.12. While its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit as to how much debt a company can use. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

(EL) is one of the world’s leading manufacturers and marketers of skincare, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products. The company’s products are sold through department stores, mass retailers, company-owned retail stores, hair salons, and travel-related establishments. Though the company is headquartered in the US, its manufacturing and research facilities are spread across Canada, Belgium, Switzerland, Japan, South Africa, and the UK.Inflation and Currency HeadwindsBecause of Estee Lauder’s wide-ranging international presence, the company is exposed to unfavorable currency fluctuations. A strong US dollar will lead the company to increase prices or suffer from contracting profit margins. For now, the dollar is up roughly 4% over the past three weeks (a strong move for the dollar) and is on the brink of breaking out.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: TradingViewRegardless of the fluctuations in the dollar, Estee Lauder has a much lower profit margin (9.41) versus the cosmetics industry (19.99).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Death of the Department StoreOne headwind that Estee Lauder has little control over is the death of the department store. The COVID-19 pandemic drove consumers away from department stores and to e-commerce platforms such as Amazon (AMZN) (a trend already in motion). Consumer preferences are also changing. Consumers are more drawn to specialty stores, boutiques, and direct-to-consumer brands than ever before.Increased Competition“Fast-fashion” retailers have gained popularity for their ability to quickly respond to changing fashion trends. While EL earnings dropped 75% last quarter while competitor e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) saw EPS launch by 182%, year-over-year. Consumers are clearly searching for inexpensive, high-quality cosmetics brands like ELF versus legacy, more expensive brands like EL. The trend is showing up in EL’s estimates moving forward.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNegative Earnings ESP ScoreEL is expected to report earnings on August 18th. Last quarter, EL missed earnings expectations by 4.08%. Investors should expect earnings to miss this quarter again because of its negative Earnings ESP Score. A negative Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) combined with a poor rank of strong sell suggests that the company will likely miss earnings expectations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPrice is the Ultimate ArbiterBeyond the faltering fundamentals and business headwinds, EL shares exhibit relative weakness versus the general market and its industry group.

The revisions trend has been particularly notable for the company’s upcoming release in October, with the $1.58 per share estimate up nearly 3% since May.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor those seeking income, KMB has that covered; KMB shares currently yield a sizable 3.7% annually, well above the Zacks Consumer Staples sector average.

He added that his colleagues had failed to balance workers' labor rights with businesses' ability to adopt reasonable rules.(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; editing by Susan Heavey)]"

The Commerce Department said on Aug 1 that spending on construction projects rose 0.5% in June, after growing 1.1% in the prior month.On a year-over-year basis, construction spending jumped 3.5% in June. Spending on construction projects is picking up at a steady pace after slowing for months owing to higher mortgage rates and borrowing costs as a result of the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hike policy.Spending in June was primarily driven by a jump in outlays in both single and multi-family homes. Spending on private construction projects rose 0.5%. This was driven by a 0.9% jump in residential construction projects in June, which follows a 2.9% jump in May.Spending on single-family housing projects and multi-family housing projects climbed 2.1% and 1.5% in June, respectively. The month also saw spending on public construction projects rise 0.3%.The housing market has been one of the biggest casualties of the Fed’s aggressive rate hike policy in its bid to combat multi-dace high inflation. The Fed has increased interest rates by 500 basis points since March 2022 before taking a brief pause in June. It again raised interest rates by another quarter percentage in July, taking the federal funds rate to the range of 5.25-5.5%.However, there is still an acute shortage of single-family available for sale, which is helping drive spending on construction despite sky-high mortgage rates.However, inflation has been showing signs of easing. Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation rose 2.6% in the second quarter, while core PCE inflation climbed 3.8%. Inflation has steadily declined from the first quarter’s increase of 4.1% and 4.9%, respectively.The headline PCE inflation increased 3% year over year in June, its lowest level in more than two years. Also, GDP grew an impressive 2.4% in the second quarter, signaling a slow but steady recovery.Story continuesThe homebuilding industry is presently trying to make a recovery as spending on private residential projects continues to grow. Also, cooling inflation has raised hopes that the Fed might soon end hiking interest rates. This bodes well for the space as lower borrowing costs will attract more buyers to the housing market.Our ChoicesGiven this scenario, it will be prudent to invest in homebuilding stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that are poised to gain from the rise in spending on construction projects.

However, some of the companies are likely to have gained from cost-saving initiatives and usage of new technologies that helped in increasing the reliability of their services and lowering operating and maintenance expenses.Per the latest Earnings Preview, the Zacks Utilities sector’s second-quarter earnings and revenues are expected to have declined 5.7% and 0.7%, respectively. While the capital-intensive utility stocks might have been impacted by the ongoing rise in interest rates, new rates implemented in their service territories and customer growth are likely to have boosted profits.Factors to NoteThe performance of capital-intensive domestic-focused utilities is expected to have been adversely impacted by an increase in interest rates as capital servicing costs rise substantially from the current levels.Except in the case of any major weather variation, demand for utility services remains more or less steady, regardless of economic cycles. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration report, mild weather conditions during the first half of 2023 are likely to have resulted in a 3% decline in electricity usage, year over year. Thus, mild weather might have adversely impacted utility earnings during the second quarter.However, Utilities continue to benefit from various favorable factors, such as new electric rates, customer additions, cost management and the implementation of energy-efficiency programs. Also, the ongoing investments to improve the resiliency of electric infrastructure against extreme weather conditions and the transition to cost-effective, renewable energy sources to produce electricity aid the power industry. Furthermore, the government is assisting in increasing the use of renewable energy through tax credits.The Inflation Reduction Act will support and accelerate the Utilities’ transition toward clean-energy sources. The Act has removed uncertainties related to federal incentives for the usage of renewable sources. It also entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way and is expected to boost earnings potential.According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

Updates from the clinical pipeline include:Aflibercept 8 mgIn June 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) for the Biologics License Application (BLA) for aflibercept 8 mg for the treatment of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), DME, and diabetic retinopathy (DR). The CRL was issued solely due to unresolved observations resulting from an FDA inspection at a third-party contract manufacturing organization, Catalent, that the Company engaged to complete vial-filling for aflibercept 8 mg. The CRL did not identify any issues with the aflibercept 8 mg clinical efficacy or safety profile, trial design, labeling, or drug substance manufacturing, and no additional clinical data or trials have been requested. The FDA has informed the Company and Catalent that certain manufacturing data and other information are required from Catalent to allow the FDA to approve aflibercept 8 mg; the Company expects that these data and information will be submitted to the FDA by mid-August 2023. The FDA has stated that it intends to prioritize the review of this submission, and therefore the Company anticipates the FDA will take action on the aflibercept 8 mg BLA during the third quarter of 2023.In June 2023, the Company announced top-line, two-year (96 weeks) data for aflibercept 8 mg from the pivotal PHOTON trial in patients with DME. The longer-term data among aflibercept 8 mg patients who completed the trial demonstrated that the vast majority of patients were able to maintain or further extend the dosing intervals through two years. In addition, visual gains for aflibercept 8 mg remained consistent with those observed in the first year of the trial. In PHOTON, the safety of aflibercept 8 mg continued to be similar to EYLEA through two years and remained consistent with the known safety profile of EYLEA from previous clinical trials for DME. Results from the PHOTON study were presented at the American Society of Retina Specialists annual meeting in July 2023.The two-year data from the pivotal PULSAR trial for aflibercept 8 mg in wet AMD continue to be expected in the third quarter of 2023.In May 2023, Bayer announced that it initiated a Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aflibercept 8 mg at extended dosing intervals compared to the standard of care, EYLEA, in macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO).Dupixent (dupilumab)The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for uncontrolled COPD with an eosiniphilic phenotype based on the positive results of the Phase 3 BOREAS study. Based on ongoing discussions with the FDA, the Company expects that in addition to the BOREAS study results, data from the replicate Phase 3 NOTUS study will be needed to support an sBLA, and such data requirements remain under discussion with the FDA. The Company expects final results for the NOTUS study in mid-2024.The Company and Sanofi presented positive Phase 3 results from the BOREAS trial in adults currently on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (triple therapy) with uncontrolled COPD and evidence of type 2 inflammation at the 2023 American Thoracic Society International Conference. The results were also published in the New England Journal of Medicine.In June 2023, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan approved Dupixent for the treatment of adult patients with prurigo nodularis.Oncology ProgramsThe Company announced promising data from three independent expansion cohorts of a Phase 1 trial for fianlimab, an antibody to LAG-3, in combination with Libtayo® (cemiplimab) in adults with advanced melanoma, which were also presented at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. These results demonstrated that the combination led to clinically meaningful and durable results across multiple advanced melanoma patient populations. The safety profile of the combination was generally consistent with the safety profile of Libtayo monotherapy and other anti-PD-(L)1 agents, except for higher rates of adrenal insufficiency, which were successfully managed with steroid replacement.The Company also presented updated positive data from two expansion dose cohorts from a pivotal trial for linvoseltamab, a bispecific antibody targeting BCMA and CD3, in patients with heavily pre-treated, relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma at the ASCO Annual Meeting. No new safety signals were identified.The Company is investigating multiple CD28 costimulatory bispecific antibodies, including PSMAxCD28, EGFRxCD28, MUC16xCD28, and CD22xCD28, in ongoing Phase 1 trials in a variety of tumor settings in combination with Libtayo, or in combination with corresponding CD3 bispecifics. In the ongoing study of REGN5678, a costimulatory bispecific antibody targeting PSMA and CD28 in advanced prostate cancer, the Company has observed antitumor activity in combination with Libtayo as well as with REGN5678 monotherapy. In the Libtayo combination cohort, there have now been two immune-mediated Grade 5 adverse events (death), including one in July 2023. As a result, the Company has discontinued enrollment of patients receiving the combination of REGN5678 and full-dose Libtayo, and plans to explore REGN5678 combinations with lower doses of Libtayo. The Company also plans to enroll patients in a REGN5678 monotherapy cohort, as well as in combination with other immunotherapy modalities. Other costimulatory bispecific development programs continue their respective dose-escalation studies.Itepekimab, an antibody to IL-33The Phase 3 program investigating itepekimab in patients with COPD who are former smokers passed a recent interim futility analysis. The analysis was conducted by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee, and the Company and Sanofi remain blinded to the data. Results from the AERIFY-1 and AERIFY-2 studies are expected to be reported in 2025.Corporate UpdateThe United States Supreme Court issued a unanimous opinion, ending a nearly decade-long patent dispute related to Praluent® (alirocumab). The decision affirms the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s opinion, which held that Amgen’s asserted U.S. PCSK9 patent claims were invalid.Second Quarter 2023 Financial ResultsRevenues($ in millions) Q2 2023 Q2 2022 % ChangeNet product sales:      EYLEA - U.S. $1,500  $1,621 (7%)Libtayo - U.S.  130   91 43%Libtayo - ROW  80   —  *Praluent - U.S.  41   31 32%Evkeeza® - U.S.  19   11 73%Inmazeb® - U.S.  2   —  *Total net product sales  1,772   1,754 1%       Collaboration revenue:      Sanofi  944   678 39%Bayer  377   358 5%Other  (4)  8  *Other revenue  69   59 17%Total revenues $3,158  $2,857 11%       * Percentage not meaningful.Net product sales of EYLEA in the U.S. decreased in the second quarter of 2023, compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to a lower net selling price driven by changing market dynamics, including increased competition.Sanofi collaboration revenue increased in the second quarter of 2023, compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to the Company's share of profits from commercialization of antibodies, which were $751 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $497 million in the second quarter of 2022. The change in the Company's share of profits from commercialization of antibodies was driven by higher profits associated with an increase in Dupixent sales.Refer to Table 4 for a summary of collaboration revenue.Operating Expenses  GAAP %Change Non-GAAP(a) %Change($ in millions) Q2 2023 Q2 2022  Q2 2023 Q2 2022 Research and development (R&amp;D) $1,085  $794  37% $974 $690 41%Acquired in-process research and development (IPR&amp;D) $—  $197  (100%) * * n/a Selling, general, and administrative (SG&amp;A) $652  $476  37% $562 $418 34%Cost of goods sold (COGS) $192  $149  29% $163 $137 19%Cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing (COCM) $213  $148  44% * * n/a Other operating (income) expense, net $(1) $(17) (94%) * * n/a              * GAAP and non-GAAP amounts are equivalent as no non-GAAP adjustments have been recorded.GAAP and non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses increased in the second quarter of 2023, compared to the second quarter of 2022, driven by additional costs incurred in connection with higher headcount and headcount-related costs, the advancement of the Company's late-stage pipeline, the impact of the 2022 amendments to the Sanofi collaboration agreements, and increased manufacturing activity associated with the Company's earlier-stage product candidates.Acquired IPR&amp;D in the second quarter of 2022 included a $195 million charge related to the Company's acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, Inc.GAAP and non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses increased in the second quarter of 2023, compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to an increase in commercialization-related expenses for Libtayo outside the U.S. (as effective July 1, 2022, the Company became solely responsible for the commercialization of Libtayo worldwide), higher headcount and headcount-related costs, and higher contributions to an independent not-for-profit patient assistance organization.COCM expenses increased in the second quarter of 2023, compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to the recognition of costs in connection with manufacturing commercial supplies of Dupixent.Other Financial InformationGAAP other income (expense) included the recognition of net unrealized losses on equity securities of $31 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $164 million in the second quarter of 2022. GAAP and Non-GAAP other income (expense) also included interest income of $118 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $28 million in the second quarter of 2022.In the second quarter of 2023, the Company's GAAP effective tax rate (ETR) was 10.6%, compared to 11.5% in the second quarter of 2022. In the second quarter of 2023, the non-GAAP ETR was 12.2%, compared to 13.6% in the second quarter of 2022.GAAP net income per diluted share was $8.50 in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $7.47 in the second quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $10.24 in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $9.77 in the second quarter of 2022. A reconciliation of the Company's GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in Table 3 of this press release.During the second quarter of 2023, the Company repurchased shares of its common stock and recorded the cost of the shares, or $723 million, as Treasury Stock.

These non-GAAP financial measures are computed by excluding certain non-cash and/or other items from the related GAAP financial measure. The Company also includes a non-GAAP adjustment for the estimated income tax effect of reconciling items. A reconciliation of the Company's GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in Table 3 of this press release.The Company makes such adjustments for items the Company does not view as useful in evaluating its operating performance. For example, adjustments may be made for items that fluctuate from period to period based on factors that are not within the Company's control (such as the Company's stock price on the dates share-based grants are issued or changes in the fair value of the Company's investments in equity securities) or items that are not associated with normal, recurring operations (such as acquisition-related integration costs). Management uses these non-GAAP measures for planning, budgeting, forecasting, assessing historical performance, and making financial and operational decisions, and also provides forecasts to investors on this basis. With respect to free cash flows, the Company believes that this non-GAAP measure provides a further measure of the Company’s operations' ability to generate cash flows. Additionally, such non-GAAP measures provide investors with an enhanced understanding of the financial performance of the Company's core business operations. However, there are limitations in the use of these and other non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude certain expenses that are recurring in nature. Furthermore, the Company's non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Any non-GAAP financial measure presented by the Company should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.  (b)The casirivimab and imdevimab antibody cocktail for COVID-19 is known as REGEN-COV® in the United States and Ronapreve™ in other countries. The Company records net product sales of REGEN-COV in the United States and Roche records net product sales of Ronapreve outside the United States.  (c)The Company's 2023 financial guidance does not assume the completion of any business development transactions not completed as of the date of this press release.  (d)Gross margin on net product sales represents gross profit expressed as a percentage of total net product sales recorded by the Company. Gross profit is calculated as net product sales less cost of goods sold.  (e)Corresponding reimbursements from collaborators and others for manufacturing of commercial supplies is recorded within revenues.Conference Call InformationRegeneron will host a conference call and simultaneous webcast to discuss its second quarter 2023 financial and operating results on Thursday, August 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM Eastern Time.

581,7096a7a4-9f93-32b0-a744-2648a9a8a53c,DGX,2023-08-03,"Inflammation Marker Signifies Increased Mortality Risk, Finds New Study in PLOS ONE",PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inflammation-marker-signifies-increased-mortality-124700723.html,1690980420,STORY,['DGX'],"[Ten-fold increase in death risk in individuals with high levels of myeloperoxidase, or MPO, compared to those with low levels, according to analysis of 3,700 patients of MDVIP tested by Quest DiagnosticsSECAUCUS, N.J., and BOCA RATON, Fla., Aug. 2, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The higher the level of a marker of inflammation in circulating blood, the greater the risk of dying from a range of medical disorders, according to a new study published in PLOS ONE. The analysis is the first to demonstrate that lowering levels of myeloperoxidase, or MPO, a marker of chronic inflammation traditionally associated with heart disease, may help provide insight into an individual's mortality risks from a range of diseases beyond heart disease. With these insights, individuals with their healthcare providers may be able to take more aggressive actions to lower personal risk.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated logo. (PRNewsFoto/Quest Diagnostics Incorporated)Researchers from Quest Diagnostics (NYSE: DGX), MDVIP and Harvard Medical School conducted the analysis. It is based on de-identified clinical MPO laboratory data from testing provided by the Quest Cardiometabolic Center of Excellence at Cleveland HeartLab in Ohio on 3,700 patients under the care of MDVIP-affiliated physicians. As part of the MDVIP Annual Wellness Program, physicians provide their patients MPO screening based on a Quest MPO blood test.""This study provides strong evidence that not only does a high MPO level signify heightened mortality risk from a range of diseases, but that lowering an MPO level reflects a reduction in that risk,"" said lead author Marc S. Penn, MD, PhD, FACC, co-author of the study and Medical Director for the Quest Cardiometabolic Center of Excellence at Cleveland HeartLab, as well as physician at Summa Health Heart and Vascular Institute. ""This finding raises the prospect MPO can help identify individuals at significantly elevated risk for death, so physicians can direct more aggressive care to patients who may benefit as compared to those of lower risk.""Story continuesWhite blood cells (called neutrophils) help the body fight infections and heal injuries through a process that involves a limited and local inflammatory response. When inflammation turns chronic, white blood cell activation may trigger adverse changes in the body. One of these changes is the activation of the white blood cells that then release MPO into the blood stream.Risk of Death Nearly 10 Times Higher in Individuals with Highest MPO vs. Lowest MPO Scores After Five YearsFor the study, the researchers randomly selected 3,700 patients enrolled in MDVIP (mean age 66.5 years, 65% female), with data on age, sex and serial laboratory results from 2011 through 2015 for MPO and several other laboratory markers, including low-density cholesterol (LDL) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a diabetes marker. The team also included information on incidence and dates of major acute cardiovascular events (MACE), including myocardial infarction (""heart attack"") and stroke, as well as date and cause of death. Compared to other studies, the population was relatively low risk, with a prior myocardial infarction rate of 2.4%.The analysis utilized medically recognized cutoffs for MPO levels of low (&lt;470 pmol/L), moderate (470-539 pmol/L) and high (≥540 pmol/L). Over the study period, approximately 356 patients died for which cause of death could be determined.Among the key findings:Death rates (per 1,000 patient years)1 5 years from first MPO measure were 2 for low MPO levels, 15 for moderate levels and 21 for high MPO levels.Fifty percent of deaths in patients with an elevated MPO were due to cardiovascular death (23.7%) or cancer (18.7%). Liver, renal, respiratory and central nervous disorders (Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis) contributed another 20.9% of deaths, with most other causes due to Alzheimer's dementia and the classifier old age (as defined by treating physician) (15.8%) and sepsis (11.2%).The correlation of elevated MPO with risk of death remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, prior cardiovascular events, baseline HbA1c, and baseline LDL-C.Individuals under the care of an MDVIP doctor who lowered their MPO (by 100 pmol/L) reduced mortality by 5% over 5 years.The researchers also noted MPO's performance in the study raises the prospect it may be a more specific predictor of mortality than high-sensitivity CRP, a well-established marker of inflammation described in other research.The researchers theorized that high MPO may not cause higher mortality risk, but rather, may indicate changes in the body that raise risk of death from a range of disorders possibly caused or aggravated by chronic inflammation.""We've long known that chronic inflammation is a significant indicator and contributor of disease risk, which is why MDVIP-affiliated physicians have provided their patients with annual MPO screening for over a decade,"" said senior author Andrea Klemes, DO, FACE, Chief Medical Officer of MDVIP, who is responsible for leading innovation and medical initiatives for its primary care model. ""Published data has already shown that when patients have elevated MPO levels, our physicians have more time to better identify the root causes and work with them on steps they should follow to help reduce their levels. This latest study is powerful in raising the prospect that the doctor-patient relationship can improve clinical outcomes when informed by markers that better identify risks for disease.""Quest and MDVIP researchers previously demonstrated that after physicians identified MPO levels in patients of MDVIP, the prevalence of elevated MPO levels declined from 20% to less than 5% five years later2. The study suggests that physician and patient awareness contributed to actions that helped reduce MPO levels, presumably due to more proactive coaching in areas that include nutrition, exercise and sleep, medication changes as well as reducing insulin levels.3""Our study adds to a growing body of research demonstrating chronic inflammation has systemic adverse impacts on health well beyond heart disease,"" said author Mouris Saghir, PhD., an expert in lipidemia and Vice President and General Manager, Cardiometabolic and Endocrine, for Quest Diagnostics, from the Quest Cardiometabolic Center of Excellence at Cleveland HeartLab. ""Crucially, it also shows individuals who take actions to reduce MPO may reduce their risk of death. Individuals with high or moderate MPO levels may also be advised to be especially proactive in pursuing cancer and other health screenings to identify potential risks in early, treatable stages.""The study's strengths include its large sample size. Limitations include lack of diversity (population was greater than 90% Caucasian) and lack of information on specific drug therapy information on each patient.The full study can be accessed online at PLOS ONE here.The Quest Cardiometabolic Center of Excellence at Cleveland HeartLab provides cardiometabolic testing, services, and resources to help identify hidden risk of heart disease and metabolic-associated conditions earlier. The center's multi-marker approach of adding inflammation-specific tests to traditional lipid testing provides additional insight into an individual's cardiovascular risk. In addition, this approach helps measure risk across a spectrum, allowing for long-, mid- and near-term assessment, so healthcare providers to better identify hidden risk and treat more aggressively when appropriate.About MDVIPMDVIP leads the market in membership-based healthcare that goes far beyond concierge medicine services with a national network of more than 1,100 primary care physicians serving over 385,000 patients. MDVIP-affiliated physicians limit the size of their practices, which affords them the time needed to provide patients with highly individualized service and attention, including a comprehensive annual preventive care program and customized wellness plan.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Although, when we looked at Gap (NYSE:GPS), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Gap is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.014 = US$116m ÷ (US$11b - US$2.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).Thus, Gap has an ROCE of 1.4%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Specialty Retail industry average of 13%. Check out our latest analysis for Gap roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Gap compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For Gap Tell Us?In terms of Gap's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 1.4% from 25% five years ago. However it looks like Gap might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.The Bottom Line On Gap's ROCEBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Gap's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. And investors appear hesitant that the trends will pick up because the stock has fallen 60% in the last five years. In any case, the stock doesn't have these traits of a multi-bagger discussed above, so if that's what you're looking for, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.Story continuesLike most companies, Gap does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

To skip our detailed analysis of current market dynamics, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Bargain Stocks To Buy in August.Fitch Downgrades US Debt - AAA to AA+On August 2, Fitch Ratings downgraded the US credit rating from a long-held AAA to AA+ while holding a Stable Outlook. The downgrade came in light of the country's ""expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years, a high and growing general government debt burden, and the erosion of governance relative to 'AA' and 'AAA' rated peers over the last to decades,"" according to Fitch. In light of this downgrade, US markets have been down for the day. The S&amp;P 500 fell by 65.64 basis points, or 1.44%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 355.50 basis points, or 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite index fell by 316.56 basis points, or 2.22%, on August 2. While some are worried that this is signaling the end to the extended stock rally seen in the markets so far this year, others don't seem to be all too worried about the downgrade.On August 2, CNBC's Closing Bell showed a snippet from an earlier conversation with Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. According to Dimon, the Fitch downgrade ""doesn't really matter that much."" He also noted that while there are several countries now that are higher-rated than the US, these countries continue to live under the ""American military enterprise,"" highlighting that the US still retains its international dominance. Additionally, Liz Young, the head of investment at SoFi, also noted at CNBC's Closing Bell that this downgrade isn't a surprise, but it's also not a big deal for the US at present. The country very narrowly avoided a default two months ago, and the state of the markets and the economy continues to be volatile.Is A Pause In The Rally A Good Thing?However, this should not worry investors too much. According to Young, the pause in the stock market rally after the downgrade and the ensuing market pullback may even be healthy for the market in the long run. Finally, Josh Brown, the CEO, and co-founder of Ritholtz Wealth Management, also noted during the closing bell that before the downgrade, the average gains for the top 20 S&amp;P 500 stocks stood at around 83%, and these same stocks have fallen by about 3% on average after the Fitch downgrade. Brown believes that investors should consider this an opportunity to find stocks to go long on rather than pulling out of these companies entirely.Story continuesMost of the stocks that have been on the rise in the S&amp;P 500 so far this year include tech stocks, primarily, followed by other sectors such as consumer staples and healthcare, among more. Sectors like these that have largely been performing well in 2023 can serve as excellent investment opportunities at present since top-tier stocks in these areas are currently down. Investors can thus add these names to their portfolios at a bargain if they act fast and act smart. Companies like Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), and AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO), among several others, are considered to be some of the best bargain stocks in the market today, according to analysts. However, other stocks that have particularly begun falling in light of the Fitch downgrade may also be worth taking a look at right now. They may well be considered to be some of the best cheap stock options to buy today. Since the S&amp;P 500's top performers were the ones that took the biggest hits after the downgrade, picking them up now may also ensure that investors get some of the best stocks to buy and hold for 20 years or more. Considering the above, we have compiled a list of some good bargain stock options for investors heading into August.12 Best Bargain Stocks To Buy in AugustImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyTo select the stocks for our list, we used a stock screener to first find stocks with P/E ratios below 20.

Launched in 2000 by the United Nations General Assembly, it is celebrated around the world to raise awareness about the plight of refugees and celebrate their strength and courage. Cisco has a long history of supporting refugees around the world, and we do so by tapping into our people, our technology, and our financial resources. This includes launching humanitarian relief campaigns where Cisco employees can make donations which the Cisco Foundation matches 1:1.Cisco donates its technology to provide connectivity for refugee communities so they can connect with their loved ones and avail themselves of local resources and support services. The technology donations also facilitate coordination, collaboration, and communication among humanitarian relief agencies so they can deliver services with efficiency, effectiveness, transparency, and security.Cisco complements all of this with financial resources to invest in the work and tech-enabled solutions developed and delivered by its non-governmental organization (NGO) partners to provide equitable access to critical information and resources to people in need, whether they have been displaced due to war, other conflict, climate events, etc. And, Cisco invests along a continuum, providing humanitarian relief in the immediate aftermath of a crisis, as well as longer term investments in education and economic empowerment initiatives to foster long-term stability, security, and resilience.This year's theme is Compassion, and as we reflect on the numerous partnerships that Cisco and the Cisco Foundation have in relation to helping refugees in crisis, we want to highlight just a few of our incredible NGO partners and their life-changing work.HIASHIAS stands for a world in which refugees find welcome, safety, and opportunity. The world's oldest refugee agency, HIAS brings over 100 years of experience protecting displaced persons-including women and children, and ethnic, religious, and sexual minorities-whose lives are in danger for being who they are. HIAS currently works in 22 countries across the United States, Latin America, Africa, Eurasia, and the Middle East to help refugees rebuild their lives in safety, and advocates to ensure that all displaced people are treated with dignity. In 2022 alone, HIAS reached over 1.35 million people directly and indirectly through their signature approach programs including legal protection, economic inclusion, gender-based violence (GBV) prevention and response and community-based mental health and psychosocial services. The global refugee crisis shows no signs of abating as war, violence, and climate change continue to force people to flee their homes. Across its programs, HIAS will continue to protect the safety, health, and rights of vulnerable individuals and support their ongoing recovery through integrated programming focused on mental health support, prevention, and response to gender-based violence, economic inclusion, and legal protection.
