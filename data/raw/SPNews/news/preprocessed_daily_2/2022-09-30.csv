1,7056f3ab-10fd-3106-b21d-517d4f0b9567,TXN,2022-09-30,Subdued Growth No Barrier To Texas Instruments Incorporated's (NASDAQ:TXN) Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/subdued-growth-no-barrier-texas-110020774.html,1664535620,STORY,['TXN'],"[With a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 17x Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) may be sending bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 13x and even P/E's lower than 7x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's lofty.Recent times have been advantageous for Texas Instruments as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Texas Instruments.Is There Enough Growth For Texas Instruments?There's an inherent assumption that a company should outperform the market for P/E ratios like Texas Instruments' to be considered reasonable.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 27%. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 68% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 0.8% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.6% per year, which is noticeably more attractive.With this information, we find it concerning that Texas Instruments is trading at a P/E higher than the market. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Final WordGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Our examination of Texas Instruments' analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E anywhere near as much as we would have predicted. When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium.It is also worth noting that we have found 3 warning signs for Texas Instruments (2 don't sit too well with us!) that you need to take into consideration.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Texas Instruments. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that sit on P/E's below 20x and have grown earnings strongly.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

The call came after reports surfaced earlier in the week that the tech giant would slow iPhone production amid softer-than-expected demand.""We expect material negative estimate revisions driven by weaker consumer demand (Services already in slowdown and we expect products to follow),"" Mohan warned.That downgrade prompted Mohan's colleague at BofA Vivek Arya to highlight the potential risk to shares of Apple's suppliers.Customers shop at an Apple Store on the first day of sale for the Apple iPhone 14 in Beijing, China, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)""We assess the potential impact of Apple unit cuts on semis vendors by analyzing historical Apple exposure to determine average selling prices per iPhone,"" Arya wrote. ""We then reduce consensus iPhone unit estimates by a similar magnitude applied by our BofA IT Hardware team. Our analysis assumes cuts are incremental, though it is possible consensus already includes some weakness in outlook (and note potential for incremental upside from second half content opportunities).""According to Arya, here are the top names in the Apple supplier ecosystem and their exposures to any Apple demand slowdown:High risk (3% to 5% sales downside): Cirrus Logic (CRUS), with an 80% Apple exposure, Skyworks (SWKS), with a 55%-60% exposure, and Qorvo (QRVO), with a 30%-35% exposure.Moderate risk (1% to 2% sales downside): large-cap vendors Qualcomm (QCOM) and Broadcom (AVGO), each with about 20%-25% Apple sales exposure, and iPhone sensor suppliers Coherent (COHR) and Lumentum (LITE), with 5% and 15% sales exposure, respectively.Low risk (less than 1% sales downside): Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI), and NXP Semiconductors (NXP), each with less than 10% Apple exposure.Apple stock is off by more than 7% so far this week, worse than the 2% drop for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Year to date, Apple's stock is down by 20%.Story continuesFurthermore, the impact of a smartphone slowdown may not just be limited to Apple's products, Arya contended. That, in turn, could lead to a broader pullback for producers.""Despite modest Apple cuts, China/Android handset weakness is having a more pronounced impact on the overall smartphone market,"" Arya explained. ""In July, China mobile phone sell-in declined roughly 30% on a MoM/YoY basis, catalyzing BofA Global Tech team to lower CY22/23 smartphone unit declines to -12%/-3% YoY (vs. -10%/+1% prior). ... While Android impacts are broadly known (we highlight QRVO SepQ/DecQ guide on its FQ1 call, representing near $350 million miss), visibility remains limited, and length of corrections remains questionable, creating sustained downside risk.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Accenture ACN, CVB Financial CVBF, Investar Holding ISTR, Microsoft MSFT, Texas Instruments TXN.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Stocks in Focus on Recent Dividend Hikes Amid Market MayhemWall Street witnessed its worst first half in 50 years this year. Thereafter, a two-month long impressive summer rally raised optimism among market participants that the market might have bottomed out. However, the Fed's tougher-than-expected hawkish monetary stance in the Jackson Hole Symposium last month and its September FOMC meeting destroyed all hopes.Threats of a RecessionAs the interest rate is surging in the United States, global investors are trying to hold U.S.-dollar denominated assets to get higher returns. Consequently, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of six major currencies, has skyrocketed to a 20-year high in 2022.With respect to the U.S. dollar, – the British pound plunged to an all-time low, the Japanese yen is at a 20-year low, the euro is at a 20-year low and the Chinese yuan has fallen to its 14-year low. Currencies of several major emerging economies have fallen to their historic-low levels against the U.S. dollar.Economists and financial researchers are concerned that a rising dollar will hurt the sales of U.S. multinational companies as their products will be more expensive in the international markets. Further, the volume of international trade is likely to be impacted as most of these trades are settled in U.S. dollar terms.The yields of U.S. government bonds have soared. On Sep 27, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note touched 4%, its highest since 2010. The yield on the short-term 2-year U.S. Treasury Note climbed 4.3%, its highest since 2007. The yield on the long-term 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note closed at 3.88%.Story continuesThe yields of 2-year and 10-Year Notes have inverted for the last two months. After the last round of rate hike in September, the yields on 10-Year and 30-Year Notes have also inverted. Economists generally consider this situation as a sign of an imminent recession.Stocks in FocusAt this juncture, dividend-paying stocks will be in huge demand to safeguard one's portfolio. We believe one should consider stocks that have recently raised their dividend payments:Accenture has been steadily gaining traction in its outsourcing and consulting businesses backed by high demand for services that can improve operating efficiencies and save costs. ACN has been strategically enhancing its cloud and digital marketing suite through buyouts and partnerships.Accenture's strong operating cash flow has helped it reward shareholders in the form of dividend payments and share repurchases, and pursue opportunities in areas that show true potential.

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 2.11%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.54%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.3%.Heading into today, shares of the independent oil and gas company had lost 24.41% over the past month, lagging the Oils-Energy sector's loss of 11.61% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 8.19% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Range Resources as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Range Resources is projected to report earnings of $1.36 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 161.54%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $1.05 billion, up 247.3% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $5.49 per share and revenue of $4.06 billion. These totals would mark changes of +171.78% and +38.72%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Range Resources should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.93% higher. Range Resources is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).Story continuesValuation is also important, so investors should note that Range Resources has a Forward P/E ratio of 4.52 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 4.5, which means Range Resources is trading at a premium to the group.Meanwhile, RRC's PEG ratio is currently 0.16. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States was holding an average PEG ratio of 0.21 at yesterday's closing price.The Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector.

Don't Ignore These 2 Oils-Energy Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-130001249.html,1664456401,STORY,"['RRC', 'LNG']","[Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Range Resources (RRC) earns a Zacks Rank #1 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.45 a share, just 26 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 25, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.45 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.36 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Range Resources has an Earnings ESP of 6.18%.RRC is one of just a large database of Oils-Energy stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Cheniere Energy (LNG).Cheniere Energy, which is readying to report earnings on November 3, 2022, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $5.21 a share, and LNG is 35 days out from its next earnings report.For Cheniere Energy, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.78 is 9.06%.Story continuesRRC and LNG's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

This is because stocks near that level are perceived to be winners. However, stocks touching a new 52-week high are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals.Moreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced. While the speculations are not baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, investors might lose out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices. Stocks such as PBF Energy Inc. PBF, Unum Group UNM, HF Sinclair DINO and TravelCenters of America TA are expected to maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs.  More information on a stock is necessary to understand whether or not there is scope for further upside.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks. The strategy borrows from the basics of momentum investing. This technique bets on “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.In fact, overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay a premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Story continuesSetting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring the continuation of their rally for some time.Current Price/52 Week High &gt;= .08This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.08 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks &gt; 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks &gt; 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales &lt;= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate &lt;= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) &gt;= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank =1No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since its inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price &gt;= 5This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) &gt;= 100000The inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are our four picks of the 11 stocks that made it through the screen:PBF Energy is a leading refiner of crude.

The call came after reports surfaced earlier in the week that the tech giant would slow iPhone production amid softer-than-expected demand.""We expect material negative estimate revisions driven by weaker consumer demand (Services already in slowdown and we expect products to follow),"" Mohan warned.That downgrade prompted Mohan's colleague at BofA Vivek Arya to highlight the potential risk to shares of Apple's suppliers.Customers shop at an Apple Store on the first day of sale for the Apple iPhone 14 in Beijing, China, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)""We assess the potential impact of Apple unit cuts on semis vendors by analyzing historical Apple exposure to determine average selling prices per iPhone,"" Arya wrote. ""We then reduce consensus iPhone unit estimates by a similar magnitude applied by our BofA IT Hardware team. Our analysis assumes cuts are incremental, though it is possible consensus already includes some weakness in outlook (and note potential for incremental upside from second half content opportunities).""According to Arya, here are the top names in the Apple supplier ecosystem and their exposures to any Apple demand slowdown:High risk (3% to 5% sales downside): Cirrus Logic (CRUS), with an 80% Apple exposure, Skyworks (SWKS), with a 55%-60% exposure, and Qorvo (QRVO), with a 30%-35% exposure.Moderate risk (1% to 2% sales downside): large-cap vendors Qualcomm (QCOM) and Broadcom (AVGO), each with about 20%-25% Apple sales exposure, and iPhone sensor suppliers Coherent (COHR) and Lumentum (LITE), with 5% and 15% sales exposure, respectively.Low risk (less than 1% sales downside): Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI), and NXP Semiconductors (NXP), each with less than 10% Apple exposure.Apple stock is off by more than 7% so far this week, worse than the 2% drop for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Year to date, Apple's stock is down by 20%.Story continuesFurthermore, the impact of a smartphone slowdown may not just be limited to Apple's products, Arya contended. That, in turn, could lead to a broader pullback for producers.""Despite modest Apple cuts, China/Android handset weakness is having a more pronounced impact on the overall smartphone market,"" Arya explained. ""In July, China mobile phone sell-in declined roughly 30% on a MoM/YoY basis, catalyzing BofA Global Tech team to lower CY22/23 smartphone unit declines to -12%/-3% YoY (vs. -10%/+1% prior). ... While Android impacts are broadly known (we highlight QRVO SepQ/DecQ guide on its FQ1 call, representing near $350 million miss), visibility remains limited, and length of corrections remains questionable, creating sustained downside risk.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

12,c53a7768-c5e7-3b0a-86d2-5487bef111fc,PVH,2022-09-30,Why Is PVH (PVH) Down 14.3% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-pvh-pvh-down-14-153003949.html,1664465403,STORY,['PVH'],"[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for PVH (PVH). Shares have lost about 14.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PVH due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.PVH Corp Q2 Earnings Top Estimates, Dip Y/Y on InflationPVH Corp posted second-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while sales missed the same. Both metrics declined year over year.Despite the ongoing macroeconomic challenges, continued momentum in its core brands — Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger — remained upsides. However, the North America unit was drab due to supply-chain issues.That said, management remains on track with its PVH+ Plan, which aims at product strength and consumer engagement, direct-to-consumer, digital enhancement and improving its supply-chain capabilities, which are likely to result in substantial cost efficiencies and better productivity.In sync with its plans, PVH intends to reduce 10% of its workforce in its global offices by the end of 2023. The move will generate savings of more than $100 million, which will then be reinvested in digital, supply chain and consumer engagement related to the PVH+ Plan.In a recent development, the company announced the departure of its existing chief executive officer, Trish Donnelly. For the time being, Stefan Larsson will act as its interim CEO.Q2 HighlightsPVH Corp reported adjusted earnings of $2.08 per share, down 23.5% from the year-ago quarter's $2.72. However, the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01. On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of $1.72 per share, reflecting a decline of 31.5% from $2.51 in the prior-year quarter.In the fiscal second quarter, revenues fell 8% year over year to $2,132 million. The top line also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,226 million. This can be attributable to strength in international businesses, particularly in Europe and Asia.On the flip side, the exit from the Heritage Brands Retail business and the impacts of the Ukraine war, including the shutdown of stores in Russia, the cessation of wholesale shipments to Russia and Belarus, and reduced wholesale shipments to Ukraine, remained concerns. Supply-chain headwinds in North America acted as another deterrent.Direct-to-consumer revenues fell 5% year over year in the quarter, while Wholesale revenues plunged 11%. Revenues in the digital channel declined roughly 7% in the quarter under review.The company's gross profit amounted to $1,118.6 million, down 10% year over year. The gross margin contracted 50 bps to 57.2%, including unfavorable currency impacts of 40 bps.Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2.6% year over year to $1,019.9 million. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes totaled $211.4 million compared with $293.9 million in the prior-year quarter. This mainly resulted from reduced expenses in the prior-year period due to store closures in certain regions. The metric also included $29 million of adverse foreign currency impacts.Story continuesSegmental AnalysisPVH Corp reports financial results under three segments — Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage Brands.Revenues from the Calvin Klein segment inched down 1% year over year. Sales from Calvin Klein North America fell 1% and Calvin Klein International decreased 2%.Revenues from the Tommy Hilfiger segment declined 5% year over year in the reported quarter. Revenues were up 6% at Tommy Hilfiger North America, while the metric declined 9% at Tommy Hilfiger International.The Heritage Brands segment's revenues plunged 44% year over year in the quarter under review.Financial DetailsPVH Corp ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $699.3 million, long-term debt of $2,155.5 million, and stockholders' equity of $5,206.4 million. The company also bought back $124 million of shares under its existing $3-billion share repurchase program in the quarter under review.OutlookManagement lowered its fiscal 2022 outlook and issued the fiscal third-quarter view. The updated guidance reflects impacts of lower demand due to inflation and reduced discretionary expenses, along with higher promotions due to higher inventory. Also, unfavorably currency impacts, along with an uncertain macroeconomic environment, including supply-chain and logistics disruptions, inflationary pressures, the Ukraine war, and the COVID-19 pandemic impacts, remain concerning.For fiscal 2022, revenues are anticipated to decrease 3-4% year over year (up 3-4% on a cc basis), down from the earlier mentioned 1-2% increase. This is inclusive of a 2% reduction each for the exit of the Heritage Brands Retail business and the war in Ukraine.The bottom line is expected to be $8.00 for the year, down from the $9.20 per share mentioned earlier. Notably, the company reported $10.15 on a non-GAAP basis in the prior year. The fiscal 2022 operating margin is likely to be 9%, down from the earlier mentioned 10%.For third-quarter fiscal 2022, management expects a 4-5% year-over-year revenue decline. This is inclusive of a 2% decline from the war in Ukraine. The bottom line is likely to be $2.10-$2.15. Notably, the company reported $3.89 and $2.67 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively, in the year-ago quarter. This includes unfavorable currency impacts of 35 cents, as well as 18 cents of adverse impacts of the Ukraine war.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted -27.02% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, PVH has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, PVH has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company’s exposure to catastrophe loss induces earnings volatility and also affects the property and casualty underwriting results of Berkshire. Huge capital expenditures remain a headwind for the company.However, Berkshire Hathaway is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies measured by premium volume. Berkshire's inorganic growth story remains impressive with strategic acquisitions. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and indicates the company's financial flexibility.Continued insurance business growth fuels increase in float, drive earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses are delivering improved results with increased revenues over the past few years. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.(You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Exxon Mobil shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated – International industry over the past year (+51.1% vs. +27.2%). The company’s bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. The company made three oil discoveries in the Stabroek Block, which will increase its recoverable resources estimates to 11 billion oil-equivalent barrels.ExxonMobil also has a strong presence in the prolific Permian Basin, where it expects to boost production volumes by 25% in 2022. The company reported strong second-quarter earnings, owing to higher realized commodity prices and solid refinery utilization.ExxonMobil generated cash flow of $20.9 billion from operations and asset divestments in the second quarter. Also, it has significantly lower debt exposure than other integrated majors. Hence, ExxonMobil is considered a preferred energy firm to own now.(You can read the full research report on Exxom Mobil here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Walmart shares have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry over the past year (-4.5% vs. -3.0%). The company’s consolidated operating income and earnings per share view suggest a decline from the year-ago period figures. The company is encountering cost pressure associated with fuel prices, supply chain and excess inventory. Cost inflation and markdowns hurt its gross margin in the second quarter.However, Walmart has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance both store and online experience. Walmart has been particularly gaining from its efforts to boost delivery services through acquisitions and partnerships.The company’s U.S. comp sales continued to benefit from an increased market share in grocery in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein the top line grew year over year.

Further, expanding cloud business is contributing well to its top line.Accenture (ACN) Gains on Service Demand Despite Talent CostPer the Zacks analyst, Accenture is steadily gaining traction in its outsourcing and consulting businesses, backed by high demand for services. A competitive talent market remains a concern.Solid Investments Aid Duke Energy (DUK), Weak Solvency WoesPer the Zacks analyst, Duke Energy's investment in infrastructure and expansion projects tend to boost its long-term growth prospects. However, its weak solvency position remains a bottleneck.Market Share Gains Aid Keurig Dr Pepper's (KDP) Top LinePer the Zacks analyst, Keurig witnesses market share gains from higher household penetration in hot and cold beverages, which is likely to continue. This is supported by marketing and innovation plansSurging Orders to Drive Fortive (FTV) Amid High LeveragePer the Zacks analyst,, Fortive's performance is gaining from increased orders for both software and hardware offerings.

The company will also offer additional hours to its existing workers. Walmart is making solid price investments across key categories to offer great value to its customers. It is also offering more rollbacks to boost savings on gifts like toys, electronics, beauty and home, to name a few.The omnichannel retailer has enriched its holiday gift assortment with increased options this season and has included new brands and additional Walmart exclusives.

17,feb40da0-578e-3369-a6fd-fd5d23686daa,RJF,2022-09-30,3 Investment Banks to Watch Amid Industry-Wide Headwinds,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-investment-banks-watch-amid-130601806.html,1664456761,STORY,"['MS', 'RJF', '^GSPC', 'RJF-PB']","[The Zacks Investment Bank industry, which had been having a dream run since mid-2020, is now facing a challenging operating backdrop due to serious macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. This, along with costs related to technological upgrades and business diversification efforts, will hurt the industry players’ financials.Yet, the trading business, which had been normalizing after a robust performance during the pandemic era, is again witnessing improved performance on heightened market volatility and client activity. Hence, industry players like Morgan Stanley MS, Raymond James Financial, Inc. RJF and Evercore Inc. EVR are worth a look despite near-term headwinds.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Investment Bank industry consists of firms that provide financial products and services that include advisory-based financial transactions to corporations, governments and financial institutions across the globe. These started as partnership firms focused on initial public offerings (IPOs), secondary market offerings, brokerage and mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As). Gradually the companies have evolved into providers of various other services, including securities research, proprietary trading and investment management. Therefore, the industry players work mainly through three product segments — investment banking (comprising M&amp;As, advisory services and securities underwriting), asset management and trading and principal investments (consisting of proprietary and brokerage trading).3 Major Trends Shaping the Future of Investment Bank IndustrySlowdown in Underwriting and M&amp;As: After a blockbuster performance in 2021, IPO, underwriting (mainly equity) and deal-making activities have almost come to a grinding halt since the beginning of this year. The primary reasons for the shrinking investment banking (IB) activities are the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict and significant monetary tightening across the globe to control raging inflation. These challenging market conditions are leading to a plunge in stock prices and slowing global economic growth, thereby hurting debt and equity issuances. While the deal pipeline looks healthy, there has been a substantial decline in M&amp;A activity and volumes. Thus, subdued underwriting and advisory businesses are expected to hurt industry players’ revenue growth.Technological Upgrades Lead to Higher Costs: Innovative trading platforms and investments in technology and advertising are likely to support the overall operations of investment banks. The industry players are emphasizing attracting and retaining the best talent for building a leadership team and spending on technology to support clients with infrastructure development and new platforms. Given these efforts, investment banks are likely to face increasing technology-related costs, thereby hurting the bottom-line growth.Trading Business to Offer Support: Client activity in the trading business largely depends on the prevalent macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. From the beginning of second-quarter 2021, markets began to normalize and equity markets were less volatile following the extreme volatility recorded in 2020 and the first couple of months of 2021 due to the coronavirus outbreak-induced uncertainty. Then again, since the beginning of this year, market volatility has significantly increased on several geopolitical and macroeconomic concerns. This has helped trading volumes, which along with substantial cash in the hands of investors, might boost trading income.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates a Grim PictureThe Zacks Investment Bank industry is a 17-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #166, which places it in the bottom 34% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a disappointing earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Over the past year, the industry’s earnings estimates for the current year have moved 5.9% lower.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider despite industry-wide challenges, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Underperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Investment Bank industry has underperformed its sector and the S&amp;P 500 over the past year. While the stocks in the industry have collectively lost 17.6%, the S&amp;P 500 composite has declined 16.4% and the Zacks Finance sector fell 17.3%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry ValuationOne might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TBV), which is commonly used for valuing investment banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TBV of 3.12X, above the median level of 2.62X, over the past five years. This compares with the highest level of 3.85X and the lowest level of 1.35X over this period. However, the industry is trading at a huge discount when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is 9.36X and the median level is 9.79X.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, comparing investment banks with the S&amp;P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group’s P/TBV ratio with that of the broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio of 4.06X and the median level of 3.85X for the same period are above the Zacks Investment Bank industry’s respective ratios.Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)3 Investment Banks to Keep an Eye OnMorgan Stanley: This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is one of the leading global players in the IB business. The company has offices across 41 countries through which it offers services to corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Morgan Stanley’s initiatives to restructure operations and more focus on Wealth Management and Investment Management segments (as these are less dependent on the capital markets) are bearing fruits. The company’s strategic expansion efforts, including the buyouts of Eaton Vance, E*Trade Financial and Shareworks, are steps in this direction. Thus, both segments’ aggregate contribution to net revenues jumped from 26% in 2010 to 50% in 2021.While near-term concerns will likely hamper financials in the next few quarters, Morgan Stanley’s solid balance sheet, manageable debt level and investment-grade long-term credit ratings are major tailwinds.MS has a market cap of $136.5 billion. Over the past 12 months, shares of the company have declined 16.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has remained unchanged at $6.69 over the past 30 days.Price and Consensus: MSRaymond James: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is a diversified company based in St. Petersburg, FL. The company, along with its subsidiaries, provides financial services mainly in the United States, Canada and the U.K.RJF has accomplished several strategic deals over the past years, which has also helped its expansion into Europe and Canada. In July 2022, it acquired SumRidge Partners, which will boost its fixed income capabilities. In June, it concluded the acquisition of TriState, while in January, it closed the acquisition of U.K.-based Charles Stanley Group PLC. These deals, along with several past ones, poise Raymond James well for growth.Though steadily rising expenses and current geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties make us apprehensive, a strong balance sheet and investment-grade long-term credit ratings from leading credit rating agencies are likely to continue supporting growth. Also, Raymond James’ robust capital deployments reflect a solid liquidity position and will keep enhancing shareholder value.With a market cap of $21.6 billion, Raymond James is expected to continue benefiting from its scale and business expansion efforts. Its shares have rallied 9.4% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 earnings has remained unchanged at $9.61 over the past 30 days.Price and Consensus: RJF Evercore: This Zacks Rank #3 company is a premier global independent IB advisory firm. It also offers wealth management services. It operates from its offices and affiliates in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.EVR generates the majority of revenues from the IB business. Efforts to boost its client base in advisory solutions and geographical expansion initiatives continue to support revenue growth. Though total adjusted net revenues declined in 2019 due to lower advisory fees, the same witnessed a CAGR of 16.8% over the last four years (ended 2021). Despite several near-term headwinds, the company’s strong backlog and business investments will drive IB business in the upcoming quarters.Though steadily rising operating expenses and negligible revenue generation from the wealth management business are concerns, Evercore maintains a solid balance sheet and liquidity position. Also, the company consistently enhances shareholders’ value with steady capital deployment activities.EVR has a market cap of $3.1 billion. Over the past 12 months, shares of the company have declined 38.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ongoing-year earnings has remained unchanged at $9.66 over the past month.Price and Consensus: EVRWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The rising interest rates have been a thorn for equity investors. However, there are hidden bull markets all the time, and perhaps the best financial stocks are what investors should have a close eye on.Financial stocks have performed impressively regardless of economic cycles. For banks, particularly, the rising rates are a bullish indicator, but it’s perhaps the opposite for asset management companies. Hence, investors must do their due diligence before placing their bets on financial businesses.It’s important to have robust investment criteria based on profitability, top-line expansion, valuation and income. Moreover, it would also be the right move if investors could potentially find strong finance stocks that help make the best out of every adverse situation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmidst a myriad of choices at this time, I have curated seven of the best financial stocks you should add to your portfolios. These investments tick all the right boxes and offer a unique blend of the investment criteria mentioned above.OFSOFS Capital Corporation$7.69MSBIMidland States Bancorp$225.81 TRINTrinity Capital$13.38CINFCincinnati Financial$90.26ITUBItaú Unibanco$5.14SBNYSignature Bank$151.00RJFRaymond James$100.74OFS Capital Corporation (OFS)A laptop, pencil, pair of eyeglasses, and many coins rest on a wooden table.Source: ShutterstockOFS Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:OFS) is a small-cap financial services firm boasting a track record of incredible financial performance with robust profitability. It has had a penchant for rewarding its shareholders and currently offers a mind-boggling dividend yield of 13.50%.The company focuses on debt and equity financing for middle-market enterprises. The bulk of its portfolio is debt instruments that carry a floating rate, though, effectively protecting it from asset decline in a high-interest rate environment.Its portfolio covers multiple segments of a company’s capital structure, protecting it from major credit risks. Consequently, its recent results are in line with its historical averages, despite the troubling economic conditions while it trades at just 2.4 time’s forward sales estimates. This small-cap gem cannot be ignored at this time.Story continuesMidland States Bancorp (MSBI)Source: ShutterstockMidland States Bancorp (NASDAQ:MSBI) operates as a financial services holding company for the Midland States Bank. It offers an array of financial services, including mortgages, retail banking, commercial services and treasury management.Midland has operated a stable business that has grown its top line by roughly 10% over the past five years. Also, it comes with an attractive 4.7% dividend yield.Recent results have been relatively solid and in line with its historical performance. Its loan portfolio grew remarkably by 11% in its first half. However, it’s likely to slow down given the heightened interest rates.Nevertheless, its acquisition plans should keep loan growth stable. It boasts a large balance of variable-rate loans, which points to single-digit earnings growth for the remainder of the year.Trinity Capital (TRIN)An image of a businessman standing facing the camera with his hands in his pockets, his shadow projected behind him with his arms up and flexingSource: lassedesignen / ShutterstockTrinity Capital (NASDAQ:TRIN) is one of the more reputable names in the business development world, providing venture debt and equity financing to high-growth startups.Its business has demonstrated a strong ability to thrive in challenging market conditions and has continued to pay hefty dividends.Business development companies have done significantly better than other financial businesses during a heightened inflation environment. Venture capital funding typically slows down in such an environment, which increases venture debt demand.Therefore, startups have had to turn to venture debt from companies such as TRIN. Reports have shown that venture debt volumes in the U.S. have risen by an impressive 7.5% in the year’s first half. Additionally, TRIN’s investment commitments reached a record $608 million in the first half of this year.Cincinnati Financial (CINF)The logo for Cincinnati Financial is shown on a cellphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comCincinnati Financial (NADSAQ:CINF) is one of the leading property and casual insurers in the U.S. It accounts for roughly 1% of the total market, which is a tremendous feat given how fragmented the market is. With over $6 billion in annual premiums, it is among the top 25 insurers in its niche.CINF has had it rough over the past few quarters amidst a tough operating environment. Consequently, its share price has dipped by over 30% in the past six months. Its lackluster performance of late has done little to slow down the pace of shareholder rewards.CINF is one of the most appealing insurance companies and one of the market leaders in its niche in the U.S. It has one of the most attractive portfolios and has grown its payouts by over 60 years. Hence, with its stock trading at multi-year lows, it’s best to load up on it now.Itaú Unibanco (ITUB)The logo for Itaú Unibanco is seen on a sign.Source: SERGIO V S RANGEL / Shutterstock.comItaú Unibanco (NYSE:ITUB) operates as a full-service bank and has been around for almost a century.It’s the leading Brazilian bank in terms of sales and has more than 4,000 physical branches and a presence in 18 different countries, primarily in the Latin American region.Its business lines are highly diversified, including insurance, trading, credit, and other related services. The diversity allows it to effectively limit its risk exposure and grow its asset base over time.Recently, it’s been going all-in to expand its digital footprint. Its digital bank, called iti Itáu, targets a younger demographic that doesn’t have bank accounts.So far, iti Itáu has been an incredible inclusion to its portfolio, adding 16.7 million customers in the first quarter of this year. Considering how 70% of the Latin American population is unbanked or underbanked, Itaú’s digital arm has an amazing growth runway ahead.Signature Bank (SBNY)The logo for Signature Bank is displayed over the entrance to a building.Source: PL Gould / Shutterstock.comSignature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY) is a New York-based full-service commercial bank with a client-focused approach.It operates a balanced loan portfolio that has helped mitigate risks to an acceptably low level. Hence, it’s one of the few financial institutions that continue to perform well during these testing times.Its second-quarter results were a blow-out, beating earnings per share estimates by 4%. Loan growth was perhaps the best it’s been in several quarters, with the firm maintaining credit quality at the same time. Net interest income came in at $649.1 million for the quarter, a 42% improvement from the prior-year quarter.The improvement was driven by the expansion in interest-earning assets. Also, non-interest income was up by an amazing 61% to $37.7 million due to a bump in service charges. SBNY also declared a generous dividend of 56 cents per share, yielding a strong 1.43%.Raymond James (RJF)The logo for Raymond James (RJF) is seen on the side of a building.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comRaymond James (NYSE:RJF) is one of the most successful U.S.-based investment management firms.Its banking division has been a consistent performer, and its superior execution has led to it operating a robust margin profile. In the past five years, its gross and net income margins have averaged 94% and 15%, respectively.As expected, its banking division, offering mortgages and commercial loans, has benefitted immensely from high rates. RJF offers its lender greater flexibility in what they can charge clients. Hence, its results have been superb of late, posting yet another earnings beat in its third quarter.It’s the eighth straight quarter where the firm has beat analyst estimates on earnings which is an amazing achievement. Therefore, RJF is one of the soundest investment management firms out there that continues to perform regardless of the market conditions.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing GuidelinesMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

The company's ticker page was the most active on the Yahoo Finance platform.While the company reaffirmed its full fiscal sales outlook (excluding the impact of the strong dollar), Nike's quarter and outlook was littered with red flags. The company's earnings call also isn't winning fans on Wall Street for its more downbeat than expected tone.Here's a rundown of what you need to know on Nike's quarter.Nike earnings overview:Net Sales: $12.69 billion vs. $12.31 billion estimateGross Profit Margin: 44.3% vs. 45.4% estimateEarnings: $0.93 vs. $0.92 estimateInventory: +44% to $9.66 billion vs. $6.91 billion estimateWhy Nike stock is falling, according to Yahoo Finance:Gross profit margins dropped significantly and missed analyst estimates as markdowns piled up.Inventory ballooned 44% year over year as the economy continues to slow.China sales missed analyst estimates.Nike cut its full fiscal year gross profit margin guidance.Strong dollar is taking a big bite out of overall sales.Real Madrid's Fernando Gago (L) is tackled by Atletico Madrid's John Heitinga during their Spanish first division soccer match at Vicente Calderon stadium in Madrid October 18, 2008.

N.A. sales beat, but on heavily-compressed margins, with ongoing declines ahead; which begs the question, Why force revenues if they drive earnings before interest, taxes [EBIT] declines? Sell less, Charge more, Make more. And importantly, although direct-to-consumer [DTC] grew, both gross margin and EBIT rates (and dollars) declined (again), furthering our fears of misplaced DTC expectations.

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Equity Residential's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Equity Residential How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Equity Residential is:11% = US$1.3b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.11.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Equity Residential's Earnings Growth And 11% ROETo start with, Equity Residential's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 6.6% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for Equity Residential's moderate 13% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesWe then compared Equity Residential's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 11% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is EQR worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether EQR is currently mispriced by the market.Is Equity Residential Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Equity Residential seems to be paying out most of its income as dividends judging by its three-year median payout ratio of 72%, meaning the company retains only 28% of its income. However, this is typical for REITs as they are often required by law to distribute most of their earnings. Despite this, the company's earnings grew moderately as we saw above.Moreover, Equity Residential is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 67%. Regardless, Equity Residential's ROE is speculated to decline to 6.2% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Equity Residential's performance. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

However, it remained under pressure from recessionary fears.On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures settled at $81.23 a barrel yesterday. Investors should know that oil slipped to a nine-month low of around $77 earlier in the week — the lowest since January.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Sep 23.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 215,000 barrels compared to expectations of a 300,000-barrel decrease per the analysts. The combination of a surge in exports, lower imports and a dip in domestic production accounted for the stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer even as refinery demand contracted.Total domestic stocks now stand at 430.6 million barrels — 2.9% more than the year-ago figure but 2% lower than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) rose 692,000 barrels to 25.7 million barrels.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover increased from 26.7 days in the previous week to 26.9 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 28.2 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies decreased for the second time in three weeks. The 2.4 million-barrel fall was primarily attributable to a surge in demand. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would rise 900,000 barrels. At 212.2 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 4.3% less than the year-earlier level and 6% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) dropped after rising for four weeks in a row. The 2.9 million-barrel fall reflected an uptick in demand and lower production. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply draw of some 100,000 barrels. Despite the recent decreases, current inventories — at 114.4 million barrels — are 11.8% below the year-ago level and 20% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at 90.6%, fell 3% from the prior week.Story continuesFinal WordWTI prices recently posted its longest run of weekly losses in 2022 following the Federal Reserve's decision to hike interest rates further in line with many other central banks across the world to step up the fight against soaring inflation. The tightening monetary policies have sparked concerns about a possible recession and, consequently, slowing crude demand. A stronger greenback, which can weaken dollar-denominated commodities like crude, also contributed to the downside.What stands out is that rates may not have peaked yet, and more toughness could be in store for the remainder of this year and 2023. This is because attempts are being made to cool the 40-year high inflation and prevent it from becoming entrenched.However, the U.S. benchmark has regained some ground in the wake of EIA’s bullish inventory report. Prices also drew support from the greenback’s climbdown from a 20-year high, which can strengthen dollar-denominated commodities like crude.As it is, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group (OPEC+) agreeing on a production curtailment, the Oil/Energy market has enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.As a matter of fact, the Energy Select Sector SPDR — an assortment of the largest U.S. companies thronging the space — has risen nearly 31% year to date against a 24% loss for the broader S&amp;P 500 benchmark.Consequently, three of the top five gainers of the S&amp;P 500 this year are all energy-related names: Occidental Petroleum OXY, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Hess Corporation HES.Occidental Petroleum: OXY is the top-performing S&amp;P 500 stock in 2022, with a gain of 114%. Occidental Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 21.6%, on average.OXY has a projected earnings growth rate of 331.8% for this year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Occidental Petroleum’s 2022 earnings has been revised 5.5% upward over the past 60 days.Marathon Petroleum: This stock is among the best performers on the S&amp;P 500 Index, with shares having appreciated 54% in 2022. MPC, carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy),  has a projected earnings growth rate of 788.6% for this year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Marathon Petroleum’s 2022 earnings has been revised 14.6% upward over the past 60 days. MPC’s expected EPS growth rate for three to five years is currently 23%, which compares favorably with the industry's growth rate of 10.5%.Hess Corporation: Hess shares have appreciated 47% so far in 2022. HES has a projected earnings growth rate of 309.1% for this year.Hess, with a market capitalization of $33.5 billion, has a VGM Score opf B.

The more active December contract was down $2.07 at $85.11.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell $1.74, or 2.1%, to $79.49.Both contracts rose by more than $1 during the session but dropped on news that OPEC's oil output rose in September to its highest since 2020, surpassing a pledged hike for the month, according to a Reuters survey on Friday.""There is definitely some profit taking from the gains we saw earlier in the week. $80 is sort of the pivot point these days,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.""Increased worries about financial stability in the UK ... are undermining the demand outlook once again,"" Kilduff added.Brent and WTI gained 2% and 1% on a weekly basis, marking the first weekly rise since August and following nine-month lows hit this week.Money managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to September 27, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said.While the dollar has dropped from 20-year highs earlier in the week, it gained through the day. A stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated oil more expensive for buyers holding other currencies, reducing demand for the commodity.""Price swings have become the norm as market players juggle worries over the global economy and the prospect of tightening oil supplies,"" said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM.The market has seen support from the prospect of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies considering cutting production quotas by between 500,000 and 1 million barrels per day (bpd) at their Oct. 5 meeting.Story continues""A deteriorating crude demand outlook won't allow oil to rally until energy traders are confident that OPEC+ will slash output,"" senior OANDA analyst Edward Moya said.Analysts expect a production cut because demand fears linked to a possible global economic slowdown and rising interest rates have weighed on crude prices.U.S. energy firms this week added two oil rigs for a third week in a row, but growth in the third quarter slowed due to recession fears and nagging supply shortages.Top White House officials are also set to meet with oil executives on Friday to discuss Hurricane Ian and low gasoline inventories as President Joe Biden warns the industry not to price-gouge consumers, according to two sources familiar with the matter.Brent and WTI prices finished the third quarter with chunky 23% and 25% declines respectively.(Reporting by Rowena Edwards; additional reporting by Sonali Paul in Melbourne and Emily Chow in Singapore; editing by Jason Neely, Elaine Hardcastle, Marguerita Choy and David Gregorio)]"

In June of that year, a financial adviser with Soderberg &amp; Partners said that Sinch’s “growth journey must continue, or there is a great risk that the stock will end up at the other end of the chart.”Softbank, which acquired a tenth of Sinch in November 2020, is selling its remaining stake of 5% to Sinch’s co-founder and interim Chief Executive Officer Johan Hedberg and Neqst D2 AB, a firm connected to the company’s Chairman Erik Froberg.Shares rose as much as 24% in Stockholm on Friday, the biggest gain since February last year.

(NYSE: FE), is using a helicopter equipped with an aerial saw to trim trees and maintain proper clearances along 17 difficult-to-access transmission line corridors in Maryland, West Virginia and Virginia. The work will help keep power flowing to customers by reducing the frequency and duration of tree-related power outages, especially those associated with severe weather.Potomac Edison Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)""Taking this step to safeguard our high-voltage power lines is one of the most effective ways to enhance service reliability for our customers,"" said Linda Moss, president of FirstEnergy's Maryland operations. ""Our work is paying off. In 2021, the amount of time Potomac Edison customers experienced service interruptions due to trees dropped by 20% compared to 2019.""Suspended on a boom beneath the helicopter and equipped with multiple 24-inch rotary blades, the aerial saw is typically deployed along transmission lines in areas that are environmentally sensitive or inaccessible to bucket trucks and other vehicles. This fast, safe and efficient method of trimming typically covers more area in a day than a ground crew might complete in a week. The saw also eliminates the risk of injury to workers using bucket trucks or climbing trees to cut limbs near high voltage equipment.The saw cleanly cuts tree limbs 8 to 10 inches in diameter, which fall straight to the ground propelled by air blasts from the helicopter rotors. Ground crews will move limbs that may fall onto roadways, yards, agricultural fields or in streams into adjacent wooded areas. The ground crew will also flag and stop motorists along roads if the helicopter saw is working nearby.The helicopter trimming trees is an MD 500 owned and operated by Aerial Solutions. The aerial saw will trim trees along 182 miles of transmission lines in Berkeley, Grant, Hampshire, Hardy, Jefferson and Morgan counties in West Virginia; Frederick, Garrett and Washington counties in Maryland; and Frederick and Page counties in Virginia. The work is expected to conclude in October.Story continuesThe helicopter flies above and alongside transmission lines and may circle around to perform additional trimming. The pilot communicates with local airport personnel whenever the helicopter is operating within their air space.On the ground, Potomac Edison will clear vegetation along approximately 3,100 miles of distribution power lines in its Maryland and West Virginia service area this year as part of its $33 million vegetation management program.Potomac Edison serves about 275,000 customers in all or parts of Allegany, Carroll, Frederick, Garrett, Howard, Montgomery and Washington counties in Maryland and about 151,000 customers in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia.

ALGN need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 30, 2022 $325.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Align Technology shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Align Technology is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Medical - Dental Supplies industry that ranks in the Bottom 8% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.28 per share to $2.23 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Align Technology right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

51,8e0553fe-51d9-3fad-9997-d0ee54e32993,MSFT,2022-09-30,Apple’s Tech Supply Chain Shows Difficulty of Dumping China,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-tech-supply-chain-shows-014350316.html,1664537296,STORY,"['AAPL', 'GS', 'QCOM', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'TSM', 'CSCO']","[(Bloomberg) —Most Read from BloombergMacKenzie Scott Files for Divorce From Science Teacher HusbandMeta to Cut Headcount for First Time, Slash Budgets Across TeamsTop Apple Executive Is Leaving After Making Crude Remarks in TikTok VideoStocks Plummet to 22-Month Low as Fed Hawks Circle: Markets WrapMarjorie Taylor Greene’s Husband Files for Divorce After 27 YearsAmerican companies have had a growing list of reasons to downgrade their ties with China in recent years. Former President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Beijing’s stringent Covid lockdowns. The US-Sino standoff over Taiwan. Political pressure to “friend-shore” supply chains toward nations aligned with Washington.But breaking up, as the adage goes, is hard to do.That conclusion is evident from a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis of Apple Inc., which is trying to reduce its dependence on China. The Cupertino, California-based company already started producing some iPhone 14 models in India, in an earlier than usual move for new models. And Apple’s largest supplier, Foxconn Technology Group, recently agreed to a $300 million expansion of its production facilities in Vietnam.Read BI’s Report: Untangling US-China Technology Supply Chain Hard, Not ImpossibleBut Bloomberg Intelligence estimates it would take about eight years to move just 10% of Apple’s production capacity out of China, where roughly 98% of the company’s iPhones have been made. Scores of local component suppliers — not to mention modern and efficient transport, communication and electricity supplies — make it particularly difficult to get out of the world’s second-largest economy.“With China accounting for 70% of global smartphone manufacturing and leading Chinese vendors accounting for nearly half of global shipments, the region has a well-developed supply chain, which will be tough to replicate — and one Apple could lose access to if it moves,” BI’s report from analysts Steven Tseng and Woo Jin Ho said.An Apple spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.Story continuesIt’s one thing to look outside China for other makers of toys and t-shirts. But US technology firms invested more than two decades, and tens of billions of dollars, setting up complex production chains to provide essential goods for the e-commerce boom. Unwinding those ties could end up taking just as long, and may result in lasting damage to an already battered global economy.Of course, unanticipated events — like Europe and America’s rupture with Russia — provide a potent reminder of both the systemic risks of deep economic integration and the speed at which decoupling can occur.Political headwinds in the US have been steadily leaning against US-Chinese integration. Under President Joe Biden, the $615 billion US-China trade relationship has simmered into a cold war following the commercial tensions under Trump that resulted in tariffs on a collective $360 billion worth of bilateral goods, along with US sanctions on key Chinese technology manufacturers like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.The pandemic then ushered in President Xi Jinping’s strict virus-containment policies, which essentially barred travel and has left major areas locked down for extended periods of time. Rising tensions over US ties with Taiwan and China’s unprecedented scale of military exercises in the Taiwan Strait have become the latest flashpoint offering a case for decoupling.“There was some momentum in this direction as a consequence of the trade war and the pandemic,” Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said about decoupling. “The Shanghai lockdown was really a monster accelerant. And the cross-strait crisis in early August added more fuel to the fire.”Yet the Biden administration’s reshoring strategy — or “friend-shoring” as termed by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen — remains a lofty but unfulfilled ambition, as far as the data go.US firms had $90 billion directly invested in China at the end of 2020, and despite all the talk of decoupling, added another $2.5 billion in 2021, according to data compiled by China’s commerce ministry. The actual total is likely even higher, because some businesses are thought by analysts to route some investments through Hong Kong, or via tax havens like the Cayman and Virgin Islands.US tech supply chains in China rely on firms from Taiwan and elsewhere as well as domestic Chinese firms, increasing the level of dependence further.Apple CEO Tim Cook stands outside of the Apple Fifth Avenue store for the release of the Apple iPhone 14, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)Friendshoring ReticenceFurthermore, America’s allies aren’t exactly swayed by Yellen’s “friend-shoring” concept. Key US partners like Singapore warned the Biden administration that isolating China could destabilize the global economy and potentially “sleepwalk” the world’s largest economies into a dangerous conflict.“Such actions shut off avenues for regional growth and cooperation, deepen divisions between countries and may precipitate the very conflicts that we all hope to avoid,” Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said following Biden’s visit to the region in May.That’s not to say untangling the tech supply chains that link the US with China isn’t already happening to some extent. A Sept. 23 report from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. found that the share of US tech imports coming directly from China has declined by 10 percentage points since 2017, “mainly on moderating China mobile phone exports.”Apple’s exposure to China is also notably bigger than many others. Amazon.com Inc., HP Inc., Microsoft Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc. also depend on China to produce hardware for servers, storage and networking products, but the extent of their dependence is far below that of Apple.Bloomberg Intelligence says that overall tech-industry dependence could be reduced by 20%-40% “in most cases” by 2030. For hardware and electronic manufacturers, they could reduce their reliance on the Chinese market to 20%-30% over the next decade, BI calculates.The Biden administration is taking a two-pronged approach to weakening economic ties with China that simultaneously incentivizes companies to shift their production via subsidies and penalizes investment in China via tariffs and export controls.This summer, Biden signed two pieces of legislation — the Chips and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act — that contain provisions to help bolster domestic manufacturing of certain strategic goods like semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries and pharmaceuticals.The legislation bars companies that access the program’s $52.7 billion in federal funding from materially expanding production of chips more advanced than 28-nanometers in China — or a country of concern like Russia — for 10 years.Also this year, the US administration expanded curbs on sending US semiconductors to China, with new license requirements to sell chip-making equipment to factories that produce 14-nanometer or more advanced chips.US industry officials are developing contingency plans in anticipation of more barriers to US-China trade and expect the Biden administration to trigger a slate of additional export restrictions sometime this fall.While there’s the potential for a political reset between Biden and Xi on the sidelines of the upcoming Group of 20 leaders summit in Bali, expectations for a grand détente remain low.“I don’t see any breakthroughs coming out of the Xi-Biden meeting,” said Wendy Cutler, a former US trade negotiator and vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute.Meanwhile, private-sector sentiment has also deteriorated.A recent survey from the US-China Business Council found that US firms’ optimism about China has already fallen to a record low and evolving challenges — like China’s Covid Zero policy, power cuts and geopolitical tensions — have caused more than half of surveyed companies to delay or cancel planned investments in China.Nearly a quarter of the survey respondents said they’ve moved segments of their supply chains out of China over the past year.US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said at an event Thursday that even some companies that have been manufacturing in China for decades — for which it would be “very disruptive” to depart the country — are putting plans in place, citing conversations she’s had with chief executives.But it’s not exactly an exodus from China. A common approach has become “China Plus One” — whereby China remains a core production base, and any additional capacity is added in South and Southeast Asian nations like India, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.Last year, US firms pledged to invest about $740 million in Vietnam, the most since 2017 and more than double the amount in 2020.Taiwan itself remains a vital but vulnerable component of US supply chains. Led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., the island currently manufactures more than 90% of the world’s most advanced chips used for military and corporate computing services. Apple, MediaTek and Qualcomm, which control more than 85% of the global handset chip market, all rely on TSMC’s supply.Taiwan is expected to remain the key manufacturing hub for cutting-edge chips over the next five years, according to the Bloomberg Intelligence report.China’s booming market also underscores the opportunity cost for US suppliers. Some 19 of the world’s 20 fastest-growing chip industry firms over the past four quarters, on average, are based in China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.(Updates with comment from US Commerce secretary in second paragraph after ‘China Headaches’ chart.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Unstoppable Dollar Is Wreaking Havoc Everywhere But AmericaJay Powell Needs Investors to Lose MoneyTwitter Is in This Mess Because Jack Dorsey Was Too Busy Being a Bitcoin InfluencerGoogle’s Low-Tech Plan to Solve the Opioid CrisisAs Home Prices Surge, Americans Are Moving to Cheaper Places©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Unlike traditional consoles, Stadia allowed users to play games on devices such as Android phones and Chromecast apps for TV, by funneling data directly from Google’s server clusters. Its subscription cost $10 a month.“While Stadia’s approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn’t gained the traction with users that we expected,” Phil Harrison, Stadia vice president and general manager, wrote in a blog post on Thursday. “So we’ve made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service.”Players will be able to access their games library and play through Jan. 18. Google will refund Stadia hardware purchases, games and add-on content made through the Google Store, Harrison said.Google’s Stadia Problem? A Video Game Unit That’s Not Googley EnoughGoogle invested generously in Stadia in an effort to reach well beyond the audience of traditional gamers or those who couldn’t afford a pricey Xbox or PlayStation console. It shelled out tens of millions of dollars to get games like Red Dead Redemption 2 on the platform, Bloomberg has reported.Stadia debuted in November 2019 with popular third-party franchises including Destiny 2 and Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. But Google’s ultimate goal was to pack Stadia with original content and the company hired hundreds of game developers from Montreal and Los Angeles. They didn’t have long to ramp up before Google shuttered its in-house game development in early 2021. People familiar with the studio said at the time that the rule-bound tech giant struggled to foster an environment nurturing to video game development, which is interdisciplinary and can be chaotic. The impact of Covid-19 spurred a hiring freeze at Google, which presented challenges for staffing up the division.Story continuesGamers also chafed at the idea that games they purchased for $60 a piece didn’t feel like they belonged to them, since they were stored in the cloud -- a concern validated by Thursday’s shutdown notice. Accustomed to owning their own hardware, some gamers felt like Stadia appeared too jarring of a shift. The service missed its sales targets on controllers and monthly active users by hundreds of thousands, Bloomberg has reported.With the exit of Stadia, that leaves Amazon.com Inc.’s Luna, Microsoft Corp.’s xCloud and Nvidia Corp.’s GeForce Now to chart the future of cloud gaming.(Updates with additional context from fourth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMillions in Cryptocurrency Vanished as Agents Watched HelplesslyPfizer Needs to Prove It’s Ready to Move On From Covid-19Maine Lobster Union Points the Way for Organizing Gig Economy WorkersThe Unstoppable Dollar Is Wreaking Havoc Everywhere But AmericaBig Pharma Is Chasing a $55 Billion Prize of Safer Blood Thinners©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The new service aids in the seamless collection and transfer of data from millions of vehicles to the cloud in real-time cost-efficiently.The service is equipped with intelligent data-collection capabilities, which enables developers to reduce the amount of data transferred to the cloud by selecting the exact data that is needed for their use cases.The service enables automotive companies to access, structure and standardize proprietary vehicle data seamlessly without developing custom data-collection systems.Customer Base to ExpandWe believe that the underlined service will help AWS gain strong momentum among automakers, suppliers, fleet operators and technology solution vendors in the automotive industry.Notably, customers like Bridgestone, Hyundai Motor Group, LG CNS and Renesas Electronics have already shown interest in AWS IoT FleetWise.We believe that the growing customer momentum will continue to drive AWS's top line. Strengthening clientele will continue to aid its dominance and competitive edge against its strong peers like Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet's GOOGL Google.Apart from customer interest in the new service, AWS was picked by Pick n Pay, the strategic cloud provider. Pick n Pay leverages AWS services to bring advancement in the supply-chain network of its stores, develop digital customer experiences in omni-channel grocery and streamline its operations.It was revealed that CEAT LTD is leveraging AWS cloud capabilities such as the Internet of Things, analytics, business intelligence and machine learning to invent intelligent tires and carry out its smart manufacturing process seamlessly.AWS was selected by Delta Air Lines as the preferred cloud provider. Additionally, AWS was chosen by Prasar Bharati News Services in India.We believe that the expanding customer base will continue to drive AWS’s top line. In second-quarter 2022, AWS generated revenues of $19.7 billion (16% of Amazon’s net sales), which rose 33% year over year.Story continuesAmazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM)Amazon.com, Inc. revenue-ttm | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteBottom LineWe believe that AWS’s strengthening clientele across the world will continue to aid Amazon in gaining a competitive edge against the above-mentioned peers.Microsoft Azure has become the key growth driver for Microsoft. The company is currently riding on the robust adoption of Azure cloud offerings. Azure's increasing number of availability zones and regions globally, along with strength in its consumption-based business, is likely to continue driving Microsoft's cloud momentum in the near term.Similarly, Google Cloud is contributing substantial growth to the total revenues of Alphabet. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting Alphabet's cloud position.Nevertheless, AWS’s growing efforts toward strengthening its portfolio offerings are likely to keep it ahead of the above-mentioned peers.Apart from AWS IoT FleetWise, the company made its managed wide area network (WAN) service, namely AWS Cloud WAN, generally available. The service aids in the seamless development, management, operation and monitoring of a global network with the help of a central dashboard.It also announced the general availability of three new serverless analytics options for Amazon EMR, Amazon MSK and Amazon Redshift.We believe that portfolio strength will continue to drive AWS’ customer momentum, which, in turn, will aid Amazon in sustaining its cloud dominance. This will instill investor optimism in the stock in the days ahead.Notably, Amazon has lost 29.2% on a year-to-date basis.According to the latest Canalys report, AWS accounted for 31% of the global cloud spending in second-quarter 2022, maintaining its leading position in the booming cloud market.Microsoft’s Azure, the second-largest cloud-service provider, accounted for 24% of worldwide cloud spending.

Friedman said the recent surge in orders is largely for indoor event venues such as theaters or charity organizations. Live Nation, for example, just ordered 100,000 tests. And the tests generally aren't the for the audience — they're for performers and crew.Negative Covid-19 antigen test kit, one step coronavirus antigen rapid test, saliva swab, 1 test box with imagine of lungs, close upFriedman said the top-sellers are Abbott's (ABT) BinaxNOW, FlowFlex and iHealth. Abbott is in a quiet period and declined to comment on if it is seeing a surge in sales.The surge in purchase comes as no surprise to Friedman, who has at least three to five workers out with COVID-19 every month — and some are getting it every few months.And with more mitigation measures being relaxed at the federal and state levels, it is up to independent businesses to take on the burden of keeping their employees safe, he said.Friedman anticipates bulk orders will continue to increase, and knows his company — which has purchased the tests at-risk to sell — is able to offer a better price than what is on the shelves in stores.""Based on what's happened in the past few years, and what we know about the variants, going forward, I to say this, but I think it's going to fly up aggressively,"" he said.He stores the tests in a climate-controlled warehouse, explaining that he's taking on a substantial risk for the number of tests he has in stock.""There was a point where we had a bunch of tests and they were expired and we had to throw them away. We wrote it off,"" Friedman explained.A minimum order is 25 tests, with the least expensive selling for around $5-$6, whereas the same test on retail shelves is $8 or above, Friedman said.Story continues""The ugly truth is, these tests cost 50 cents to $1 to manufacture — they cost nothing,"" he said.There could be a shortage of supply if the new variant causes a surge, but prices are unlikely to move, Friedman added.So does he have enough supply for a potential winter surge?""I want to say yes, but I thought last January as well, and I was super wrong,"" Friedman said.Individual purchases of tests are not following a similar surge, however.

After all, the companies listed in the Dow 30 didn’t get there as part of a fly-by-night operation. Though not commanding the most heart-pounding storylines, these blue chips have the potential to help keep your portfolio afloat in times of stress.Fundamentally, the Federal Reserve changed the broader monetary and economic paradigm. Rather than an accommodative framework which in many ways actively encouraged market speculation, the Fed now seeks to tighten monetary excesses. That’s deflationary, which incentives value over sheer growth.In this environment, here are seven of the best Dow sleeper stocks to buy that may outperform.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHDHome Depot$267.20WBAWalgreens Boots Alliance$32.76JPMJPMorgan Chase$107.21MRKMerck$86.40IBMInternational Business Machines$122.42PGProcter &amp; Gamble$135.74AXPAmerican Express$137.96Home Depot (HD)Home Depot aisleSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comTypically a steady hand among Dow sleeper stocks, home improvement retailer Home Depot (NYSE:HD) printed an uncharacteristic amount of red ink so far this year, down a staggering 34%. Fundamentally, the company likely suffered from rising interest rates. Yes, higher rates after a long period of dovish monetary policy will present a shock to any company. However, Home Depot was among the leading beneficiaries of the incredible housing boom last year.To quickly recap, a combination of fiscal stimulus and easy monetary policy allowed many folks to acquire real estate. Additionally, affluent members of society looked to combat the long-term erosion of purchasing power via pivoting to housing to protect their wealth.Today, this macro environment has been flipped on its head. Higher rates equate to higher borrowing costs. In turn, housing prices have dipped. Thus, expectations are that renovation budgets could take a hit, especially as many return to the office.Story continuesNow for the 5,000 IQ play: if interest rates revert lower in a recessionary environment, this may spark a second housing boom, as previously priced-out buyers can move in. It’s a risky narrative, but one that could make HD one of the Dow sleeper stocks to buy.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comOne of the hardest-hit Dow sleeper stocks, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) admittedly presents a scary profile, even for contrarians. On a year-to-date basis through the Sept. 23 session, WBA hemorrhaged more than 38% of market value. That’s significantly more than the benchmark equity indices.At the same time, if we’re being honest, Walgreens likely deserves at least some of the red ink. Initially this year, many bought into the idea that WBA was one of the Dow sleeper stocks. For instance, the company enjoyed tailwinds from its coronavirus vaccine and testing-related revenue channels. Later in the year, though, management delivered a less-than-stellar outlook, highlighting a number of challenges for the business.At the same time, an argument exists that Walgreens has fallen enough already. Fundamentally, the company still enjoys tailwinds because of greater awareness of infectious disease protocol and management. Should another breakout occur, WBA stock provides nice cyclical upside for those seeking beaten-down Dow sleeper stocks.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)A sign for JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM).Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.comAs strange as it might sound, the deflationary dynamic stemming from tighter monetary policy could benefit JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). In theory, banks benefit from a rising interest rate environment because their net interest margins increase. In other words, banks’ lending products become much more profitable. That said, higher interest rates also means slower business activity due to more onerous borrowing costs. And that’s a key reason why JPM stock has shed 32.5% year-to-date.Now, the reason why deflation could be positive for JPMorgan comes down to the company’s wealth management arm. To be blunt, a monkey throwing darts at a board can potentially be a solid financial advisor during an inflationary cycle. With inflation, the dollar loses purchasing power, incentivizing active investing.In a deflationary environment, the opposite is true. Investors have more options, with bonds and cash appearing much more attractive. Thus, JPMorgan’s vast army of educated and experienced financial advisors could induce more cash to enter the markets, spurring relative outperformance. This company’s wealth management division is the best of the best, making JPM one of the Dow sleeper stocks to consider.Merck (MRK)Merck (MRK) logo outside of corporate buildingSource: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.comLet’s be honest. In the shadow of meme stocks and cryptocurrencies, Merck (NYSE:MRK) comes off as incredibly boring. At the same time, the pharmaceutical giant presents an incredibly relevant business profile. That’s why MRK stock is up 13% year-to-date while the major equity indices plunged. Perhaps most importantly, with the fading of the Covid-19 pandemic, Merck enjoys a massive fundamental catalyst.Step back down on Memory Lane for a moment. During the initial onslaught of Covid-19, many feared the outbreak. I think we all remember the images of people dropping dead on the street, a scene out of a horror film. This dynamic caused many people to avoid hospital visits because of infection concerns.With the distribution of the Covid-19 vaccine along with general cabin fever, fear around the Covid-19 pandemic is abating. Accordingly, the company’s solutions for cancer or other long-term diseases such as Keytruda may finally see the kind of adoption many previously expected.International Business Machines (IBM)Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comArguably, it doesn’t get much sleepier among Dow sleeper stocks than International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). A boring legacy technology firm in the best of times, IBM mostly garners positive attention from investors for its dividend. With a forward yield of 5.38%, this company’s passive income profile remains a compelling selling point. After all, with inflation taking a bite out of everything, every bit of mitigation helps.However, what I appreciate about IBM is that it features an “old faithful” type of investment storyline. Unlike the flashy tech names, this clear example of a Dow sleeper stock doesn’t attract the limelight. Today, this factor is paying off dividends (literally and figuratively). While IBM stock is down 10% for the year so far, that’s a superior performance relative to the tech sector.Moreover, I appreciate that management is pivoting from hardware to the cloud. Honestly, the transition is taking longer than investors would like. However, over time, I think this transition could pay off for patient investors looking for a place to hide.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)A Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) distribution center in Vandalia.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comOne sleeper stock that features a higher-than-average probability of surviving and thriving is Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG). As a household goods giant, the company presents a painfully boring profile. I can’t imagine anybody waking up in the morning, logging onto the trading desk and bidding up PG stock on the basis of toiler paper fundamentals.Still, the lessons of Covid-19 brought a harsh awakening for consumers. During the initial onslaught of the pandemic, household goods such as toilet paper and hand sanitizer essentially represented gold bricks. Just when you thought that global supply chain disruptions couldn’t take a turn for the worst, they did with a more recent shortage of feminine hygiene products.It’s also possible that with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine – a conflict that shows no sign of slowing down – supply chain disruptions could worsen. After all, we’re dealing with countries that export plenty of commodities that we took for granted prior to the new normal. Accordingly, PG stock is one that’s on my watch list right now.American Express (AXP)the American Express logo etched into woodSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.comAs a financial services firm that specializes in issuing credit cards, American Express (NYSE:AXP) doesn’t shout “Dow sleeper stocks to buy” to many.Why?Well, This company’s business model may not benefit from this tighter monetary policy environment. As borrowing costs increase, consumers naturally seek to save money, not to spend it.That said, American Express caters to a more affluent user base. Notably, the company’s premium-level Platinum cardholders have an average net worth of $4.3 million. What’s more, this customer base produces an average income of $474,000. In other words, we’re talking about a user demographic that may not be as impacted by inflation, deflation or whatever-flation.American Express is a company that still provides risk, don’t get me wrong.

The report details the steps the company, a leading provider of integrated human capital management software solutions for human resources, payroll, benefits, and insurance services, is taking in pursuit of ""Working for a Better World.""""Working for a better world is something Paychex has been doing since we were founded in 1971,"" said Stephanie Schaeffer, chief legal and ethics officer at Paychex. ""As we've grown to the company we are today, with nearly 16,000 employees serving 730,000 clients, we've remained steadfast in holding ourselves to the highest standards of ethics, including an unwavering commitment to integrity. ESG is about applying that integrity across everything that touches our business - from how we use energy in our operations; to how we contribute to the quality of life in the communities we serve; to how we establish our governance framework; to how our workplace is a place of diversity, equity, and inclusion.""The 2022 ESG Report highlights the impact Paychex has made to-date and new initiatives related to the nine pillars of the company's ESG program:Ethics - Last fiscal year, Paychex celebrated its 14th appearance on the World's Most Ethical Companies list, which honors organizations that demonstrate exceptional leadership and a commitment to business integrity through best-in-class ethics, compliance, and governance practices.Governance - To address the company's ongoing dedication to advancing ESG priorities, the Paychex board of directors divided the responsibilities of the Governance and Compensation Committee into two separate board committees: the Compensation and Leadership Committee and the Nominating and ESG Committee.Privacy and Security - The privacy and security of confidential client information is a top priority of Paychex. The company's leadership can be demonstrated using independent security rating services such as Security Scorecard and Bitsight, providing external validation of the Paychex cybersecurity program.Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion - Paychex continues to prioritize and amplify diverse voices through recruitment, employee resource groups, mentorship programs, training, and pay equity. Last fiscal year, in (FY22): 62 percent of Paychex hires were female (+12 percent from FY21); 44.4 percent of Paychex hires were racially diverse (+14.5 percent from FY21); and Paychex was included on Forbes' Best Employers for Diversity and Best Employers for Women lists.Employees - Paychex is committed to supporting the well-being and professional growth of its nearly 16,000 employees. In FY22 more than 5,800 workforce training, skills, and leadership development programs were delivered to employees, and an average of 21.5% of Paychex employees utilized emotional and well-being support through the company's Employee Assistance Program, 17.6% of eligible household members used the program as well.Environment - To align with the shifting guidance on reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, Paychex has committed to updating its environmental policy at least once a year, performing enterprise-wide risk assessments, and achieving net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.Community - The spirit of giving is central to the corporate identity of Paychex. In 2014, the Paychex Charitable Foundation was founded to support community service organizations where Paychex employees and clients live and work. In FY22, the Paychex Charitable Foundation introduced a multi-million-dollar commitment and strategic giving framework focused on four critical areas of well-being: mental wellness, physical wellness, financial wellness, and professional skills development. The framework will direct a $1 million investment, over the course of four years, in support of each area of well-being, for a total investment of $4 million.Empowering Businesses - Paychex is committed to helping businesses succeed. As of May 31, 2022, we helped clients retroactively claim more than $8 billion in Employee Retention Tax Credits by providing a review, documentation, preparation and filing of the amended returns. This builds on the success of the $65 billion in Paycheck Protection Program loans we helped our clients secure (with a 96 percent forgiveness rate), providing them much-needed assistance at the height of the pandemic.Occupational Safety - With an ongoing focus on providing its employees with a safe and comfortable work environment, Paychex has experienced a 75 percent reduction in the number of reported new workers' compensation claims in the last five years.Story continuesVisit www.paychex.com/corporate/corporate-responsibility to download the Paychex 2022 ESG Report: Working for a Better World.About PaychexPaychex, Inc.

After all, paydays are always the best.Investors are familiar with Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have successfully increased their dividend payout for 25 consecutive years.However, there is an even more exclusive group of dividend payers known as Dividend Kings.To achieve the attractive title of a Dividend King, a company must increase its dividend payout for a mind-boggling 50 consecutive years.Clearly, Dividend Kings know how to establish highly-successful operations.And they carry a commendable commitment to shareholders.Several companies have recently broken into the elite Dividend King club, including PPG Industries PPG, Target TGT, and Sysco SYY.Target and PPG Industries are two of the newest rookies in the club, having just made the cut.On the other hand, Sysco joined the group a few years ago.Below is a chart illustrating the share performance of all three companies year-to-date, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a deeper dive into each one.SyscoSysco markets and distributes a range of food and related products primarily to the food service or food-away-from-home industry.SYY’s annual dividend yield sits nicely at 2.7%, just below its Zacks Consumer Staples Sector average of 2.9%.In addition, the company carries a sizable 8.7% five-year annualized dividend growth rate paired with a payout ratio sitting at 60% of earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the company carries a favorable growth profile; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $4.20 for FY23 reflects a staggering 30% Y/Y uptick in earnings. And in FY24, the bottom line is projected to expand by an additional 13%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company also carries solid valuation levels, further bolstered by its Style Score of a B for Value.SYY shares trade at a 17.6X forward earnings multiple, well beneath the 21.7X five-year median and representing a slight 7% discount relative to its Zacks Consumer Staples Sector.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTargetTarget is a titan in the retail realm, with stores in all 50 states and DC. As of late, the company has evolved from just a pure brick-and-mortar retailer to an omnichannel entity.TGT’s annual dividend yield sits at a rock-solid 2.8%, notably above its Zacks Retail &amp; Wholesale Sector, paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 41% of earnings.Further, the company’s five-year annualized dividend growth rate comes in at a stellar 7.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRising costs have eaten into margins, with the company’s bottom-line forecasted to take a sizable 40% hit in FY23. Still, the picture kicks back into green in FY24, with estimates calling for 50% earnings growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTGT shares trade at a forward P/E of 19.2X, above its five-year median of 16.8X. However, the value is still nowhere near highs of 30.4X in 2020 and represents an attractive 19% discount relative to its Zacks Sector.Further, Target sports a Style Score of a B for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPPG IndustriesPPG Industries is a global supplier of paints, coatings, chemicals, specialty materials, glass, and fiberglass. PPG has manufacturing facilities and equity affiliates in roughly 70 countries.PPG’s annual dividend yield comes in at a respectable 2.2%, notably lower than its Zacks Basic Materials Sector.However, the company’s 6.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate is undoubtedly strong, and its 38% payout ratio is very sustainable.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPPG Industries’ bottom-line is projected to decrease a slight 2% in FY22, but the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $7.82 for FY23 suggests Y/Y earnings growth of a double-digit 17.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPPG shares trade notably above their Zacks Basic Materials Sector average, representing a 143% premium.However, it’s worth noting that PPG shares have historically traded at relatively elevated levels, and its 16.8X forward earnings multiple is well beneath its 18.7X five-year median and high of 27.4X in 2020.PPG sports a Style Score of a C for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineTargeting income-generating assets is a widely-deployed strategy, and for a very understandable reason – we love to get paid.Of course, some dividend payers are better than others, with higher yields.However, high yields can become unsustainable over time.Instead, targeting companies that have consistently upped their dividend payouts over the years is a much better way to receive an income stream that you know is reliable.Dividend Aristocrats are highly-respectable in their own right, but Dividend Kings take the throne.All three companies above – PPG Industries PPG, Target TGT, and Sysco SYY – are newer members of the elite club, displaying a stellar commitment to their shareholders throughout the years.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Anheuser-Busch Inbev (BUD) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.83 a share 28 days away from its upcoming earnings release on October 27, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.83 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.82 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Anheuser-Busch Inbev has an Earnings ESP of 1.22%.BUD is just one of a large group of Consumer Staples stocks with a positive ESP figure. Sysco (SYY) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Sysco is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 8, 2022. SYY's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1 a share 40 days from its next earnings release.Sysco's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.36% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.99.Story continuesBUD and SYY's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

These are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on value, growth, and/or momentum characteristics.Why Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value StockDifferent than growth or momentum investors, value-focused investors are all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under what their true value is before the broader market catches on.

74,d610ff2f-7ff0-3ad1-a1fa-a1f8ba48ba40,ADM,2022-09-30,Is Trending Stock Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-archer-daniels-midland-130001386.html,1664456401,STORY,['ADM'],"[Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this agribusiness giant have returned -5.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -8.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry, which ADM falls in, has lost 7.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, ADM is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share, indicating a change of +41.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.8%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.97 indicates a change of -12.6% from what ADM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for ADM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ADM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For ADM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $23.03 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $98.51 billion and $96.12 billion estimates indicate +15.6% and -2.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryADM reported revenues of $27.28 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +19%. EPS of $2.15 for the same period compares with $1.33 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.27 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.98%. The EPS surprise was +22.86%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.ADM is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ADM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ADM, Corteva Inc. CTVA, Adecoagro S.A. AGRO and Limoneira Co LMNR.Industry: Agriculture - OperationsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1985935/4-agriculture-operations-stocks-to-watch-amid-mixed-industry-trendsThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry is poised to benefit from innovations and improved consumer demand for healthy products. Investments in acquisitions, joint ventures and expansions are likely to fortify the prospects of the industry players. Logistic and supply-chain issues, higher input costs, and elevated operational expenses have been affecting the industry. Supply-chain concerns and commodity cost pressures have been affecting the profitability of agricultural companies for a while.Nonetheless, continued investments in assets and technological capabilities to innovate and serve customers bode well for players like Archer Daniels Midland Co.,Corteva Inc., Adecoagro S.A. andLimoneira Co.About the IndustryThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry comprises companies that produce or procure, transport, store, process, and distribute agricultural commodities to consumers. It also distributes ingredients to other parts of the agriculture industry (including clothing, animal feed, energy and industrial products). Some industry players engage in dairy operations, land transformation activities and the development of food ingredients using gene-editing technology.The industry encompasses production activities related to traditional farming of crops (like corn, soybean, wheat and cotton), and livestock and poultry products (including meat, dairy and eggs). The products are mostly sold at grocery stores or exported overseas. These are also used as feedstock for other industries. For example, cotton is used in the clothing industry and corn is used in the ethanol industry.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the Future of Agriculture - Operations IndustryGrowing Organic Demand: The industry has been benefiting from an organic movement prompted by consumers' increasing demand for healthier food. Agriculturists are adopting organic production techniques, and curtailing the use of chemicals and pesticides. Innovations in food processing, improved grain-handling techniques, larger storage spaces and strong emerging market demand are conducive to the industry's growth.Healthy eating habits are likely to accelerate the purchase and consumption of alternative proteins. Focus on nourishment and wellness is pushing microbiome solutions to the forefront. The companies have been investing in acquisitions and joint ventures to build top-notch ingredients and solutions for meeting the demand for healthy products.Agricultural Export Projections: Per the U.S. Department of Agriculture, agricultural export projections for fiscal 2023 (ending Sep 30) of $193.5 billion suggest a decline of $2.5 billion from the fiscal 2022 forecast of a record $196 billion. Declines in cotton, beef and sorghum exports are the key factors resulting in lower export projections.Cotton exports are expected to decline due to drought-slashed exportable volumes. Beef exports are expected to be impacted by tight U.S. supplies. Sorghum exports are likely to decline on sharply lower exportable supplies. Wheat exports are expected to be affected by lower unit values.Meanwhile, higher exports of soybeans and horticultural products are likely to aid. Soybean exports are forecast to be up $2.2 billion to a record $35.2 billion on higher prices. Horticulture exports of $39.5 billion are expected to increase $400 million on higher exports of fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, offset by declines in tree nut exports.Elevated Costs: Industry participants have been witnessing higher costs due to rising raw material, freight and logistics costs, including constraints in labor and trucking resources, leading to higher lead times for deliveries. Supply-chain concerns and commodity cost pressures have been affecting the profitability of agricultural companies for a while. Also, the conflict in Ukraine has been creating headwinds.The companies have resorted to solid pricing strategies to counter the rising raw material costs. The participants are looking to counter the global supply-chain challenges by forming partnerships and distribution strategies. Despite the pricing strategies, supply-chain challenges and cost inflation are expected to continue hurting margins in the near term.Companies in the industry continue to face raised SG&amp;A expenses due to higher performance-related compensation, project-related costs, commissions and variable compensation. The companies are also witnessing elevated costs for investments in technology and innovation to stay ahead of the race. Continued deleverage in SG&amp;A expenses might continue to have a bearing on the profitability of companies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry is a 14-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #216, which places it at the bottom 14% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries resulted from a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group's earnings growth potential.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 and the Zacks Consumer Staples sector in a year.The stocks in the industry have collectively gained 19.2% in a year against declines of 17.2% for the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and 8.5% for the sector.Agriculture - Operations Industry's ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing Consumer Staples stocks, the industry is currently trading at 14.1X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 15.74X and the sector's 17.75X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 17.73X, as low as 10.24X and at the median of 14.32X.4 Agriculture Operations Stocks to Keep an Eye OnNone of the stocks in the Zacks Agriculture – Operations universe currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).

Whether the overall trend lower remains in place is a concern for investors.Here are four well-known REITs that rallied and rallied well:Farmland Partners Inc. (NYSE: FPI) gained 3.26%.After being down by more than 5% after trading opened the previous day, Farmland Partners came back strong. It climbs out of the oversold on the relative strength index (RSI) indicator below the price chart. The next bullish accomplishment would be to see a session close above the red 200-day moving average. Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. (NYSE: HST) had a gain of 5.01%, a hefty one-day increase for any security or sector.This gain is confirmed as real by the hefty increase in volume seen along the bottom of the price chart. Host is another REIT that is now out of the oversold RSI range, below the price chart. For bulls who own it, the next move upward needs to close above the two moving average lines.Independence Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE: IRT) gained 3.54%.This residential real estate investment trust, with the 3.42% dividend yield, is climbing out of the RSI oversold status. Despite this bullish action, Independence Realty Trust remains in a serious downtrend, well below both the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, both of which turned downward weeks ago.Park Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. (NYSE: PK) had a 4.89% gain.It’s the heavy buying volume (seen at the bottom of the price chart) that might confirm some type of low at this price. Buyers like this hotel and motel REIT. Note, however, that both significant moving averages continue to trend downward.The big macroeconomic factor affecting all of these charts is rising inflation and how much more seriously the Federal Reserve regards it as fall becomes winter. It may take a change in expectations that higher interest rates are inevitable before any REIT rallies can find real footing.Story continuesRead next: This Little Known REIT Has Produced Double-Digit Annual Returns For The Past Five YearsNot investment advice.

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 11.8% loss over the past four weeks.The increased optimism can be attributed to recovering industry fundamentals. Also, it stems from investors’ favorable view on the industry amid an anticipation that the Fed could adopt a reverse course of action with respect to interest rates, if economic trends tip into a deep-recession mode in the future.This lodging real estate investment trust is expected to post quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $0.40 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +100%. Revenues are expected to be $1.19 billion, up 40.9% from the year-ago quarter.FFO and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in FFO estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Host Hotels, the consensus FFO per share estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in FFO estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on HST going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV), since the last five years saw the share price fall 44%. And it's not just long term holders hurting, because the stock is down 38% in the last year. Unfortunately the share price momentum is still quite negative, with prices down 13% in thirty days. We do note, however, that the broader market is down 8.0% in that period, and this may have weighed on the share price.Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn. View our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Southwest Airlines moved from a loss to profitability. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.Arguably, the revenue drop of 10% a year for half a decade suggests that the company can't grow in the long term. This has probably encouraged some shareholders to sell down the stock.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on Southwest AirlinesStory continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Southwest Airlines shareholders are down 38% for the year. Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 19%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 7% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Southwest Airlines better, we need to consider many other factors.

After all, paydays are always the best.Investors are familiar with Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have successfully increased their dividend payout for 25 consecutive years.However, there is an even more exclusive group of dividend payers known as Dividend Kings.To achieve the attractive title of a Dividend King, a company must increase its dividend payout for a mind-boggling 50 consecutive years.Clearly, Dividend Kings know how to establish highly-successful operations.And they carry a commendable commitment to shareholders.Several companies have recently broken into the elite Dividend King club, including PPG Industries PPG, Target TGT, and Sysco SYY.Target and PPG Industries are two of the newest rookies in the club, having just made the cut.On the other hand, Sysco joined the group a few years ago.Below is a chart illustrating the share performance of all three companies year-to-date, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a deeper dive into each one.SyscoSysco markets and distributes a range of food and related products primarily to the food service or food-away-from-home industry.SYY’s annual dividend yield sits nicely at 2.7%, just below its Zacks Consumer Staples Sector average of 2.9%.In addition, the company carries a sizable 8.7% five-year annualized dividend growth rate paired with a payout ratio sitting at 60% of earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the company carries a favorable growth profile; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $4.20 for FY23 reflects a staggering 30% Y/Y uptick in earnings. And in FY24, the bottom line is projected to expand by an additional 13%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company also carries solid valuation levels, further bolstered by its Style Score of a B for Value.SYY shares trade at a 17.6X forward earnings multiple, well beneath the 21.7X five-year median and representing a slight 7% discount relative to its Zacks Consumer Staples Sector.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTargetTarget is a titan in the retail realm, with stores in all 50 states and DC. As of late, the company has evolved from just a pure brick-and-mortar retailer to an omnichannel entity.TGT’s annual dividend yield sits at a rock-solid 2.8%, notably above its Zacks Retail &amp; Wholesale Sector, paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 41% of earnings.Further, the company’s five-year annualized dividend growth rate comes in at a stellar 7.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRising costs have eaten into margins, with the company’s bottom-line forecasted to take a sizable 40% hit in FY23. Still, the picture kicks back into green in FY24, with estimates calling for 50% earnings growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTGT shares trade at a forward P/E of 19.2X, above its five-year median of 16.8X. However, the value is still nowhere near highs of 30.4X in 2020 and represents an attractive 19% discount relative to its Zacks Sector.Further, Target sports a Style Score of a B for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPPG IndustriesPPG Industries is a global supplier of paints, coatings, chemicals, specialty materials, glass, and fiberglass. PPG has manufacturing facilities and equity affiliates in roughly 70 countries.PPG’s annual dividend yield comes in at a respectable 2.2%, notably lower than its Zacks Basic Materials Sector.However, the company’s 6.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate is undoubtedly strong, and its 38% payout ratio is very sustainable.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPPG Industries’ bottom-line is projected to decrease a slight 2% in FY22, but the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $7.82 for FY23 suggests Y/Y earnings growth of a double-digit 17.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPPG shares trade notably above their Zacks Basic Materials Sector average, representing a 143% premium.However, it’s worth noting that PPG shares have historically traded at relatively elevated levels, and its 16.8X forward earnings multiple is well beneath its 18.7X five-year median and high of 27.4X in 2020.PPG sports a Style Score of a C for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineTargeting income-generating assets is a widely-deployed strategy, and for a very understandable reason – we love to get paid.Of course, some dividend payers are better than others, with higher yields.However, high yields can become unsustainable over time.Instead, targeting companies that have consistently upped their dividend payouts over the years is a much better way to receive an income stream that you know is reliable.Dividend Aristocrats are highly-respectable in their own right, but Dividend Kings take the throne.All three companies above – PPG Industries PPG, Target TGT, and Sysco SYY – are newer members of the elite club, displaying a stellar commitment to their shareholders throughout the years.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

By comparison, an individual stock is unlikely to match market returns - and could well fall short. That's what happened in the case of PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG): its share price dropped 22% while the market declined 19%. Longer term shareholders haven't suffered as badly, since the stock is down a comparatively less painful 1.0% in three years. Even worse, it's down 10% in about a month, which isn't fun at all. However, we note the price may have been impacted by the broader market, which is down 8.0% in the same time period.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for PPG Industries In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Unhappily, PPG Industries had to report a 30% decline in EPS over the last year. This fall in the EPS is significantly worse than the 22% the share price fall. So despite the weak per-share profits, some investors are probably relieved the situation wasn't more difficult.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on PPG Industries' earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectivePPG Industries shareholders are down 21% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the market return of -19%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 1.9%, each year, over five years. If the stock price has been impacted by changing sentiment, rather than deteriorating business conditions, it could spell opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand PPG Industries better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with PPG Industries (at least 1 which doesn't sit too well with us)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Former President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Beijing’s stringent Covid lockdowns. The US-Sino standoff over Taiwan. Political pressure to “friend-shore” supply chains toward nations aligned with Washington.But breaking up, as the adage goes, is hard to do.That conclusion is evident from a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis of Apple Inc., which is trying to reduce its dependence on China. The Cupertino, California-based company already started producing some iPhone 14 models in India, in an earlier than usual move for new models. And Apple’s largest supplier, Foxconn Technology Group, recently agreed to a $300 million expansion of its production facilities in Vietnam.Read BI’s Report: Untangling US-China Technology Supply Chain Hard, Not ImpossibleBut Bloomberg Intelligence estimates it would take about eight years to move just 10% of Apple’s production capacity out of China, where roughly 98% of the company’s iPhones have been made. Scores of local component suppliers — not to mention modern and efficient transport, communication and electricity supplies — make it particularly difficult to get out of the world’s second-largest economy.“With China accounting for 70% of global smartphone manufacturing and leading Chinese vendors accounting for nearly half of global shipments, the region has a well-developed supply chain, which will be tough to replicate — and one Apple could lose access to if it moves,” BI’s report from analysts Steven Tseng and Woo Jin Ho said.An Apple spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.Story continuesIt’s one thing to look outside China for other makers of toys and t-shirts. But US technology firms invested more than two decades, and tens of billions of dollars, setting up complex production chains to provide essential goods for the e-commerce boom. Unwinding those ties could end up taking just as long, and may result in lasting damage to an already battered global economy.Of course, unanticipated events — like Europe and America’s rupture with Russia — provide a potent reminder of both the systemic risks of deep economic integration and the speed at which decoupling can occur.Political headwinds in the US have been steadily leaning against US-Chinese integration. Under President Joe Biden, the $615 billion US-China trade relationship has simmered into a cold war following the commercial tensions under Trump that resulted in tariffs on a collective $360 billion worth of bilateral goods, along with US sanctions on key Chinese technology manufacturers like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.The pandemic then ushered in President Xi Jinping’s strict virus-containment policies, which essentially barred travel and has left major areas locked down for extended periods of time. Rising tensions over US ties with Taiwan and China’s unprecedented scale of military exercises in the Taiwan Strait have become the latest flashpoint offering a case for decoupling.“There was some momentum in this direction as a consequence of the trade war and the pandemic,” Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said about decoupling. “The Shanghai lockdown was really a monster accelerant. And the cross-strait crisis in early August added more fuel to the fire.”Yet the Biden administration’s reshoring strategy — or “friend-shoring” as termed by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen — remains a lofty but unfulfilled ambition, as far as the data go.US firms had $90 billion directly invested in China at the end of 2020, and despite all the talk of decoupling, added another $2.5 billion in 2021, according to data compiled by China’s commerce ministry. The actual total is likely even higher, because some businesses are thought by analysts to route some investments through Hong Kong, or via tax havens like the Cayman and Virgin Islands.US tech supply chains in China rely on firms from Taiwan and elsewhere as well as domestic Chinese firms, increasing the level of dependence further.Apple CEO Tim Cook stands outside of the Apple Fifth Avenue store for the release of the Apple iPhone 14, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)Friendshoring ReticenceFurthermore, America’s allies aren’t exactly swayed by Yellen’s “friend-shoring” concept. Key US partners like Singapore warned the Biden administration that isolating China could destabilize the global economy and potentially “sleepwalk” the world’s largest economies into a dangerous conflict.“Such actions shut off avenues for regional growth and cooperation, deepen divisions between countries and may precipitate the very conflicts that we all hope to avoid,” Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said following Biden’s visit to the region in May.That’s not to say untangling the tech supply chains that link the US with China isn’t already happening to some extent. A Sept. 23 report from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. found that the share of US tech imports coming directly from China has declined by 10 percentage points since 2017, “mainly on moderating China mobile phone exports.”Apple’s exposure to China is also notably bigger than many others. Amazon.com Inc., HP Inc., Microsoft Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc. also depend on China to produce hardware for servers, storage and networking products, but the extent of their dependence is far below that of Apple.Bloomberg Intelligence says that overall tech-industry dependence could be reduced by 20%-40% “in most cases” by 2030. For hardware and electronic manufacturers, they could reduce their reliance on the Chinese market to 20%-30% over the next decade, BI calculates.The Biden administration is taking a two-pronged approach to weakening economic ties with China that simultaneously incentivizes companies to shift their production via subsidies and penalizes investment in China via tariffs and export controls.This summer, Biden signed two pieces of legislation — the Chips and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act — that contain provisions to help bolster domestic manufacturing of certain strategic goods like semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries and pharmaceuticals.The legislation bars companies that access the program’s $52.7 billion in federal funding from materially expanding production of chips more advanced than 28-nanometers in China — or a country of concern like Russia — for 10 years.Also this year, the US administration expanded curbs on sending US semiconductors to China, with new license requirements to sell chip-making equipment to factories that produce 14-nanometer or more advanced chips.US industry officials are developing contingency plans in anticipation of more barriers to US-China trade and expect the Biden administration to trigger a slate of additional export restrictions sometime this fall.While there’s the potential for a political reset between Biden and Xi on the sidelines of the upcoming Group of 20 leaders summit in Bali, expectations for a grand détente remain low.“I don’t see any breakthroughs coming out of the Xi-Biden meeting,” said Wendy Cutler, a former US trade negotiator and vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute.Meanwhile, private-sector sentiment has also deteriorated.A recent survey from the US-China Business Council found that US firms’ optimism about China has already fallen to a record low and evolving challenges — like China’s Covid Zero policy, power cuts and geopolitical tensions — have caused more than half of surveyed companies to delay or cancel planned investments in China.Nearly a quarter of the survey respondents said they’ve moved segments of their supply chains out of China over the past year.US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said at an event Thursday that even some companies that have been manufacturing in China for decades — for which it would be “very disruptive” to depart the country — are putting plans in place, citing conversations she’s had with chief executives.But it’s not exactly an exodus from China. A common approach has become “China Plus One” — whereby China remains a core production base, and any additional capacity is added in South and Southeast Asian nations like India, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.Last year, US firms pledged to invest about $740 million in Vietnam, the most since 2017 and more than double the amount in 2020.Taiwan itself remains a vital but vulnerable component of US supply chains. Led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., the island currently manufactures more than 90% of the world’s most advanced chips used for military and corporate computing services. Apple, MediaTek and Qualcomm, which control more than 85% of the global handset chip market, all rely on TSMC’s supply.Taiwan is expected to remain the key manufacturing hub for cutting-edge chips over the next five years, according to the Bloomberg Intelligence report.China’s booming market also underscores the opportunity cost for US suppliers. Some 19 of the world’s 20 fastest-growing chip industry firms over the past four quarters, on average, are based in China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.(Updates with comment from US Commerce secretary in second paragraph after ‘China Headaches’ chart.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Unstoppable Dollar Is Wreaking Havoc Everywhere But AmericaJay Powell Needs Investors to Lose MoneyTwitter Is in This Mess Because Jack Dorsey Was Too Busy Being a Bitcoin InfluencerGoogle’s Low-Tech Plan to Solve the Opioid CrisisAs Home Prices Surge, Americans Are Moving to Cheaper Places©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Here's why that's a bad sign for the economyAs the economy hovers on the precipice of a recession, Goldman Sachs is targeting low performers in a new round of staffing cuts.The recent firings come after Goldman reported a 41% year-over-year decline in revenue over the summer.Deal-making in general has drastically plunged this year amidst elevated interest rates and inflation, and analysts foresee continued decreases in company earnings — signaling more troubled waters ahead for the U.S. economy.Don't missInvest your spare change and turn your pennies into a productive portfolioMitt Romney says a billionaire tax will trigger demand for these two physical assetsYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and KrogerGoldman is letting go of low performers after its low earnings reportThe investment giant reported second-quarter earnings of $2.93 billion in July this year — significantly lower than the $5.49 billion that was pulled in during the same time in 2021.“No question that the market has gotten more challenging,” David M. Solomon, Goldman’s chief executive, said on a call with analysts. “We have made the decision to slow hiring velocity and reduce certain professional fees going forward.”Goldman now seems to be reinstating its annual culling — the bank fired 1% to 5% of its underperforming staff each year prior to the pandemic. About a dozen members in the tech, media and telecommunications teams and some in the consumer retail, healthcare and industrials divisions received their pink slips last week, according to Insider.This isn’t just limited to the U.S. Bloomberg reports that at least 25 investment bankers were fired in Asia, while Financial News states another dozen were let go in London.It’s not just GoldmanGoldman isn’t the only Wall Street firm that’s floundering. JPMorgan’s investment banking revenue also plummeted by about 60% in its second quarter.About $1 trillion deals were struck in 2022 through late July, according to financial markets platform Dealogic. That’s almost 40% lower than the same time last year — and also marks the lowest number of deals in five years (aside from 2020).Story continuesStay on top of the markets: Don’t miss the latest news and a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms.

After a tumultuous first half of the year with interest rate hikes, supply chain issues, conflict in Ukraine and Russian gas cutoffs, companies are veering away from mergers and acquisitions.The national GDP fell by 0.6% for a second consecutive quarter, according to the latest estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.The National Bureau of Economic Research defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity” that persists for “more than a few months” — however it hasn’t made an official call yet, likely because the labor market and consumer confidence are still going strong.So far, most economists have been predicting a recession to arrive at some point in 2023.What to read nextBiggest crash in world history': Robert Kiyosaki issues another dire warning and now avoids ‘anything that can be printed’ — here are 3 hard assets he likes insteadIf you want to be rich, use these 3 Warren Buffett techniques no one ever talks aboutBillionaire Carl Icahn warns the 'worst is yet to come' — but when an audience member asked him for stock picks, he offered these 2 'cheap and viable' namesThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

(NYSE:GS) stock at an average sell price of US$380 over the last year, insiders seemed to have made the most of their holdings. After the stock price dropped 6.2% last week, the company's market value declined by US$6.5b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Goldman Sachs GroupOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Non-Executive Director, David Viniar, for US$7.0m worth of shares, at about US$411 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$301). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Insiders in Goldman Sachs Group didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Goldman Sachs Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Goldman Sachs Group. Specifically, Global Treasurer Philip Berlinski ditched US$2.8m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs GroupLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Goldman Sachs Group insiders own 0.5% of the company, worth about US$500m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Goldman Sachs Group Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought Goldman Sachs Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

We want to get to the pulse of Gen Z. A new survey out from Morning Consult giving us a look at the brands getting the most love from this coveted generation. Now it's all about big tech, at least at the top of the list. Leading the way, YouTube with 86% of Gen Zers liking the brand followed by Google, Netflix, and Amazon. Food is a common theme too with M&amp;Ms cracking the top five. Kit-Kat and Oreos landing in the top 10. Nike, we were just talking about that, coming in at number 12.Josh, I'm going to keep you on set here for this because you're our resident Gen Z-er. What do you think of those brands? Does it make sense to you? You're a little at the older end of Gen Z, for full disclosure. But--JOSH SCHAFER: Yes. I am at the top end of Gen Z. But I think it makes sense to me, right? I mean, Google, YouTube. I know we were talking about this a little bit off air, Dave. YouTube I think my generation definitely uses a lot more for general content. We go home at night and we watch YouTube and watch YouTube Shorts and videos on YouTube and kind of relate to YouTube in that way. And I don't think older generations are really using it that way. I think it's more of a little bit of a search. So I think that was one distinction that I found pretty interesting.I think everyone eats Oreos though. So that kind of made sense.SEANA SMITH: And Cheetos was also up there too.DAVE BRIGGS: Gen Z loves junk food. Yeah. Doritos, Kit-Kat, Oreo, and Cheetos, and even Sprite makes the list. But yes. Josh hits on it. And it's really YouTube that's a generational gap. And I think the old folks like myself and older just don't use YouTube the way Gen Z does who-- and that's where content is moving to. And that's where the news ought to move to, and sports will eventually move to. But the big surprise to me on this Gen Z brand list was that TikTok was not as part of the top 15. But it was the number one in terms of the brand G-- brand Gen Z favors compared with the general public.Story continuesAnd that's an interesting one because, again, you're talking about anyone above Gen Z doesn't use TikTok a lot. I thought that would be in the top three or four of Gen Z, which tells you skews a little bit younger, Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, it's one of those things. Because usually, if you're on TikTok, it's for the quick take. But then if you want to watch something longer form, then it makes sense that you would then sort of translate that over to YouTube. I mean, I find myself-- I do-- most of my streaming ends up being on YouTube just because of some of the companies that I follow, and a lot of them have their podcasts that they also then repurpose for some of these longer forms on YouTube.And some of these other brands though, when you look at the ones that were favored versus the general public, you have Discord, Snap, Instagram, and of course Cash App when you think digital payments. It makes sense that you're going to see people just sort of Cash Apping when you're out having a meal, and you don't have to worry about splitting the bill. It's ease and convenience. So yeah, snacks, and streaming, and clearly sharing your cash a little bit seem to be the trends of the day for Gen Z.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, I learned about Discord today too, which was a lesson. Good stuff.]"

It also booked a loss of $37 million in the quarter against the previous-year quarter’s profit of $88.2 million.The profitability has been hurt due to the rising cost of production, and increasing investments in content, marketing and partnerships.

107,d50ae05e-a99a-3c68-b769-638b75cf1a1c,NEM,2022-09-30,4 Deeply Undervalued Dividend Stocks With Yields Over 5%,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-deeply-undervalued-dividend-stocks-183306610.html,1664217186,STORY,"['NEM', 'BHP', 'MO', 'T-PC']","[The year 2022 has been challenging for many investors. Making money seems complicated when inflation is high, and returns in several asset classes remain negative. However, investing in undervalued dividend stocks with high yields is an effective way to combat the current bear market. As a result, many investors have shifted their focus towards blue-chip stocks.For now, the healthy dividend yield in these stocks ensure regular cash flow for investors. With a strong balance sheet and healthy operating cash flows, dividends are sustainable even if the industry faces near-term headwinds.Furthermore, as overall market conditions improve, these undervalued dividend stocks are poised for a meaningful rally. Investors are therefore positioned to benefit from dividend and capital gains in these fundamentally strong stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhile it’s an excellent time to accumulate undervalued growth stocks, I would remain overweight on blue-chip dividend stocks. It’s a bonus if these stocks are available at a valuation gap.Let’s talk about four undervalued dividend stocks with yields over 5%.TAT&amp;T$15.88NEMNewmont Corporation$40.97BHPBHP Group$47.94MPAltria Group$41.75AT&amp;T (T)Image of AT&amp;T (T stock) logo on a gray storefront.Source: Jonathan Weiss/ShutterstockAT&amp;T (NYSE:T) stock has underperformed after the spinoff of the media division. However, T stock still looks attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 6.3x and a dividend yield of 6.9%.Even as T stock trends lower, business developments have been positive. The company’s 5G network already reaches 281 million people nationwide. With a capital investment of $135 billion over the last five years, the company is well positioned for sustained subscriber growth.AT&amp;T has also improved its credit profile. With the media division spinoff, the company used $40 billion in proceeds for debt reduction. Moreover, in Q2 of the current year, AT&amp;T has guided for a free cash flow of $14 billion. This will support dividends and help in further deleveraging.Story continuesTherefore, the correction is a good opportunity to accumulate some AT&amp;T stock. I believe T stock could double in the next 24-36 months, and a healthy dividend payout adds to the positive.Newmont Corporation (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockWith aggressive rate hikes, gold has witnessed a meaningful correction. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) stock has declined by 45% in the last six months, and the correction seems overdone. NEM stock currently trades at a forward P/E of 16.3x, and its dividend yield of 5.4% looks very attractive.In my opinion, the correction in precious metals might be overdone. Due to geopolitical tensions, sustained inflation, and the possibility of a recession, gold will likely increase in value.Newmont has robust gold reserves of 96 million and 114 million ounces in gold resources. These reserves are likely to ensure stable production in the coming years.Moreover, Newmont reported a total liquidity buffer of $7.3 billion as of Q2 2022. With a net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 0.3x, the credit profile is vital. Even with lower gold prices, I expect the company to hold on to its investment grade rating.BHP Group (BHP)Smartphone with BHP Group logo in front of BHP website. BHP stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockBHP Group (NYSE:BHP) is another name among undervalued stocks with a yield of over 5%. BHP stock currently trades at a forward P/E of 8.4x and offers investors a dividend yield of 14.3%.BHP stock has declined sharply in the recent months with aggressive rate hikes and GDP growth concerns. However, the company delivered solid numbers for FY2022 with an underlying EBITDA of $40.6 billion. For the same period, the EBITDA margin was 65%.It is also worth noting that BHP expects to increase capital expenditure on commodities that include copper and nickel. These commodities are likely to remain in demand with a focus on clean energy.The company ended FY2022 with net debt of $300 million and gearing of 0.7%. With a robust financial profile, BHP’s dividends are sustainable. Moreover, significant capital investments will ensure steady EBITDA growth. For FY2023, the company expects to incur a capital expenditure of $7.6 billion. Thus, BHP is also well positioned to navigate any near-term downturn.Altria Group (MO)Altria office sign in Virginia capital city tobacco business closeup by road streetSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.comAltria Group (NYSE:MO) is another top pick among undervalued dividend stocks. The stock trades at a forward P/E of 8.4x and offers a dividend yield of 9.0%. Moreover, the company recently raised its quarterly dividend by 4.4% to 94 cents.Of course, there is no doubt that Altria’s valuation has been impacted by regulatory headwinds related to Juul. However, the stock seems to have discounted the worst.On the positive side, the company’s combustible segment continues to deliver robust cash flows. Even as Altria focuses on the non-combustible segment, cigarette sales will remain the cash flow driver.It’s also worth noting that the company’s oral tobacco brand has witnessed sustained market share growth in the U.S. Over the next five to ten years, the non-combustible segment will likely be the key growth driver.Altria also has exposure to the cannabis business through a 45% stake in Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON). The latter has been delivering improved growth numbers. Therefore, once cannabis is legalized at the Federal level in the United States, the segment can create more value.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

110,062e399c-b5fc-383a-84be-ed853c26428a,GD,2022-09-30,5 Dividend Growth Stocks to Beat Market Volatility,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-dividend-growth-stocks-beat-105010657.html,1664535010,STORY,"['BCC', 'NSP', 'KO', 'AZN', 'GD']","[The year 2022 has been roiled by huge volatility and uncertainty, which have raised the appeal of dividend investing. Dividend stocks are major sources of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk even though these do not offer dramatic price appreciation.In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — The Coca-Cola Company KO, General Dynamics Corporation GD, AstraZeneca plc AZN, Boise Cascade BCC, and Insperity Inc. NSP — that could be compelling picks amid market volatility.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation than simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&amp;P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environments.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 17.Here are the five of the 17 stocks that fit the bill:Georgia-based Coca-Cola, a beverage company, manufactures, markets, and sells various nonalcoholic beverages worldwide. The company provides sparkling soft drinks; flavored and enhanced water, and sports drinks; juice, dairy, and plant–based beverages; tea and coffee; and energy drinks. Coca-Cola has an expected earnings growth rate of 6.03% for this year and delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 9.85%.Coca-Cola has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.

The work will be carried out at multiple locations, with the majority of it to be accomplished in Baltimore, MD.Importance of SEWIP Block 3The rising threat of missile attacks has been fueling the demand for an effective electronic attack system that excels in defeating inbound threats.In this context, Northrop Grumman’s SEWIP enjoys significant demand as it boasts features that protect surface ships from anti-ship missiles, providing early detection, signal analysis and threat warning. NOC’s SEWIP is an upgrade to the legacy AN/SLQ-32 system, and provides game-changing capability for non-kinetic electronic attack options to the U.S. fleet.Such advantages of the electronic warfare system make it attractive for military, thus resulting in NOC winning orders for the same, like the latest one. This, in turn, is likely to boost the revenue-generation prospects of the company from the SEWIP electronic warfare system.Growth ProspectsCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats. To this end, an effective electronic warfare system that ensures anti-missile solution features is likely to witness a pent-up demand.Per a report from the GlobalNewsWire firm, the global electronic warfare system market is projected to witness a CAGR of 6.2% through 2028. Such growth prospects may benefit Northrop Grumman as its SEWIP Block 3 product already has an established position in the electronic warfare system market.Story continuesThe abounding growth prospects should also benefit defense majors who have forayed into the laser-based countermeasure system like Lockheed Martin LMT, L3Harris Technologies LHX and General Dynamcis GD.Lockheed Martin’s Advanced Off-Board Electronic Warfare (“AOEW”) program delivers persistent electronic surveillance and attack capability against naval threats like anti-ship missile (ASM). Its AOEW Active Mission Payload AN/ALQ-248 system is a self-contained electronic warfare pod hosted by the MH-60R or MH-60S Seahawk helicopter, which provides the Navy with advanced ASM detection and response capabilities.Lockheed Martin’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 5.5%. Shares of LMT have returned 15.9% value to investors in the past year.L3Harris’ Viper Shield all-digital electronic warfare suite is custom designed to be a baseline on advanced F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft and maximize their survivability and mission success. Some of its other product range include AN/ALQ-161A, AN / ALQ-211 CV-22, NH 90, AND F-16 self-protection system, AN / ALQ-214 (IDECM) F/A-18 countermeasure system, etc.The long-term growth rate of L3Harris is pegged at 3.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LHX 2022 earnings suggests growth of 3.9% from the prior-year reported figure.Since many years, General Dynamics has been performing as the Lead Systems Integrator for SEWIP Block 1. Its SEWIP, a spiral-block development program, provides an immediate improvement for the legacy surface ship electronic warfare detection and countermeasure system, the AN/SLQ-32.General Dynamics boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.2%. GD stock has appreciated 12.5% in the past year.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Northrop Grumman have rallied 34.3% against the industry’s decline of 19.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankNorthrop Grumman currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

We have the resources,"" Azeri President Ilham Aliev told reporters, pointing that his country has long been a reliable partner and supplier.The Trans-Adriatic pipeline, the final leg of the Southern Gas Corridor pipeline network, last year brought more than 8 bcm of Azeri gas into European countries such as Italy. Azerbaijan plans to raise the imports by 40% to 11.2 bcm this year.Bulgarian President Radev said another route could be faster and cheaper to take on some of the extra volumes.""What is being offered will allow ... transport immediately of Azeri supplies through the integrated gas networks of these countries,"" Radev said.Radev will discuss the idea with other Balkan leaders and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who arrives in Sofia on Saturday for the official launch of a gas link between Bulgaria and Greece that will initially transport 1 billion cubic metres of Azeri gas per year to Bulgaria.""I am certain that it would allow not only Azeri gas to come to Bulgaria but also to Europe in bigger volumes and will support the energy security of the European continent as a whole,"" Aliev said.

However, it remained under pressure from recessionary fears.On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures settled at $81.23 a barrel yesterday. Investors should know that oil slipped to a nine-month low of around $77 earlier in the week — the lowest since January.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Sep 23.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 215,000 barrels compared to expectations of a 300,000-barrel decrease per the analysts. The combination of a surge in exports, lower imports and a dip in domestic production accounted for the stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer even as refinery demand contracted.Total domestic stocks now stand at 430.6 million barrels — 2.9% more than the year-ago figure but 2% lower than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) rose 692,000 barrels to 25.7 million barrels.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover increased from 26.7 days in the previous week to 26.9 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 28.2 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies decreased for the second time in three weeks. The 2.4 million-barrel fall was primarily attributable to a surge in demand. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would rise 900,000 barrels. At 212.2 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 4.3% less than the year-earlier level and 6% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) dropped after rising for four weeks in a row. The 2.9 million-barrel fall reflected an uptick in demand and lower production. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply draw of some 100,000 barrels. Despite the recent decreases, current inventories — at 114.4 million barrels — are 11.8% below the year-ago level and 20% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at 90.6%, fell 3% from the prior week.Story continuesFinal WordWTI prices recently posted its longest run of weekly losses in 2022 following the Federal Reserve's decision to hike interest rates further in line with many other central banks across the world to step up the fight against soaring inflation. The tightening monetary policies have sparked concerns about a possible recession and, consequently, slowing crude demand. A stronger greenback, which can weaken dollar-denominated commodities like crude, also contributed to the downside.What stands out is that rates may not have peaked yet, and more toughness could be in store for the remainder of this year and 2023. This is because attempts are being made to cool the 40-year high inflation and prevent it from becoming entrenched.However, the U.S. benchmark has regained some ground in the wake of EIA’s bullish inventory report. Prices also drew support from the greenback’s climbdown from a 20-year high, which can strengthen dollar-denominated commodities like crude.As it is, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group (OPEC+) agreeing on a production curtailment, the Oil/Energy market has enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.As a matter of fact, the Energy Select Sector SPDR — an assortment of the largest U.S. companies thronging the space — has risen nearly 31% year to date against a 24% loss for the broader S&amp;P 500 benchmark.Consequently, three of the top five gainers of the S&amp;P 500 this year are all energy-related names: Occidental Petroleum OXY, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Hess Corporation HES.Occidental Petroleum: OXY is the top-performing S&amp;P 500 stock in 2022, with a gain of 114%. Occidental Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters.

""The sanctions were not enough for the Anglo-Saxons: they moved onto sabotage,"" he said.In previous comments, the White House has dismissed the accusation that it was responsible. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday damage to Nord Stream was a deliberate act of sabotage.WHY SABOTAGE A PIPELINE?German Navy Chief Jan Christian Kaack told German daily Die Welt in its Sept. 26 edition, the day leaks were first reported although he was apparently speaking before that: ""Russia has also built up considerable capacity underwater. At the bottom of the Baltic Sea, but also in the Atlantic, there is quite a bit of critical infrastructure like pipelines or submarine cables for IT.""Story continuesAlongside Nord Stream, a new pipeline has been built between gas producing Norway and Poland, which has been seeking to end its reliance on Russian energy, making the region highly sensitive for Europe's energy security.""(Russia) can intimidate Europeans through an act of sabotage. Because if they're able to blow up these pipelines in the Baltic seabed, they could do that as well to the new pipeline,"" said Kristine Berzina, senior fellow for security and defence at the German Marshall Fund.However, if it was an act of sabotage, it has damaged pipelines that were built by Kremlin-controlled Gazprom and its European partners at a cost that ran into billions of dollars.The damage also means Russia loses an element of leverage it still had over Europe, which has been racing to find other gas supplies for winter, even if the Nord Stream pipelines where not pumping gas when the leaks were discovered, analysts say.Whoever or whatever is to blame, Ukraine may also be a beneficiary. Kyiv has long called for Europe to halt all purchases of Russian fuel - even though some gas still runs to Europe across its territory. Disrupting Nord Stream brings Kyiv's call for a full Russian fuel embargo closer to reality.HOW COULD NORD STREAM HAVE BEEN DAMAGED?Experts say the scale of the damage and the fact that the leaks are far from each other on two different pipelines indicate that the act was intentional and well-orchestrated.Seismologists in Denmark and Sweden said they had registered two powerful blasts on Monday, Sept. 26 in the vicinity of the leaks and the explosions were in the water, not under the seabed.Swedish prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist, who is in charge of the preliminary investigation, confirmed in a statement on Thursday that there were detonations at Nord Stream 1 and 2 in the Swedish economic zone which caused extensive damage to the gas pipelines.He added that evidence had been seized at the scene but details were confidential as the case was sensitive.A British defence source told Sky News the attack was probably premeditated and detonated from afar using underwater mines or other explosives.""Something big caused those explosions which means ... Russia could do it. In theory, the United States could also do it but I don't really see the motivation there,"" Oliver Alexander, an open source intelligence analyst, told Reuters.The United States had long called for Europe to end its reliance on Russian gas, he said, but Washington had little obvious motivation to act now because Nord Stream was no longer pumping gas to Europe at the time the leaks were found, although the pipelines had gas under pressure inside them.""They already succeeded in stopping Nord Stream 2. It was already dead in the water, it wasn't going anywhere,"" he said.Analysts say it is possible the damage was inflicted by devices that are available on the commercial market but that given the scale and precision, it was more likely carried out by an actor with access to more sophisticated technology.The U.S. news channel CNN, citing three sources, reported that European security officials had observed Russian navy support ships and submarines not far from the sites of the Nord Stream leaks. Asked about the report, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there had been a much larger NATO presence in the area.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?The Europeans, including the Danes, are pressing on with their investigations with further results expected soon.For now, however, more direct fingerpointing between Russia and the West could worsen tensions that have already spiralled over the war in Ukraine, said Marek Swierczynski, a defence analyst for Polish think tank Polityka Insight.(Reporting by Reuters bureaus, with additional reporting by Sabine Seibold; Editing by Alexander Smith, Edmund Blair and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)]"

Inflation remains high, with the year-over-year CPI registering 8.3% in August. The Fed responded as expected, raising interest rates by 0.75 percentage points, or 75 basis points, on Sept. 21. That rate increase, the central bank’s third straight 75 basis-point hike, has resulted in the market taking yet another downturn. The S&amp;P 500 dipped to 3,670 on Sept. 22. That is less than 100 points off its 2022 low of 3,667 which was set on June 16. In short, there are many valid reasons to be wary of stocks. However, forward-looking investors would be wise to recognize the opportunities that exist. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOne such opportunity is the projected growth of green energy and renewable energy. Polaris Market Research estimated earlier this year that the revenue of the global renewable energy market would reach $1.68 trillion by 2029.

But its recent downturn was more of a reflection of Fed interest rate decisions and overall fear than an indictment of Albemarle. Story continuesALB raised its revenue guidance in early August to a range between $7.1 billion and $7.5 billion. Previously, the firm had provided guidance for full-year sales of between $5.8 billion and $6.2 billion. Its EBITDA increased 214% year-over-year in Q2, and Albemarle is opening operations in Australia and the U.S. All of these developments indicate that the company will have greater opportunities moving forward, and they make ALB stock a good investment as its prices dip. NextEra Energy (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) stock represents a Florida firm that creates electricity from renewable energy and owns utilities. A recent Morgan Stanley upgrade, along with those diverse operations, make NEE an equity worth buying in October. Let’s begin with Morgan Stanley’s upgrade. Earlier in September, Morgan Stanley analyst David Arcaro increased his price target on NEE stock from $94 to $99. He took that action because he thinks that the Democrats’ health-and-climate bill, also known as the Inflation Reduction Act, should make renewable energy systems more profitable. Such a development would clearly benefit NextEra Energy due to the large amount of wind energy and solar energy systems that it owns. Arcaro’s $99 price target looks particularly attractive as NEE currently trade around $80. NextEra Energy is also interesting because of the largest utility that it owns, Florida Power &amp; Light or FPL. FPL accounted for $4.425 billion of the firm’s $5.183 billion of revenue in Q2. Those $5.183 billion of revenue were far higher than the $3.927 billion of sales that NextEra reported during the same period a year earlier.And its utilities should become more attractive to investors seeking traditional value  names as recession fears mount. Ormat Technologies (ORA)A geothermal power plant operates with a forest and a clear, bright sky visible behind it.Source: N.Minton / Shutterstock.comOrmat Technologies (NYSE:ORA) is arguably not as well-known as ALB or NEE. I certainly hadn’t heard of Ormat until recently. That said, Ormat Technologies, which specializes in geothermal energy, is interesting. The Reno-based firm designs, builds, and supplies power-generating equipment that has been installed in energy plants in over 30 countries. The firm derives 94% of its sales from geothermal-energy recovery. Geothermal is a reliable source of energy that is relatively stable compared to other renewables. After all, solar and wind create little or no energy a great deal of the time. The stability and reliability of geothermal is reflected in the firm’s top line which has steadily increased from $436 million in 2016 to $586 million in 2021. Ormat Technologies’ gross margin has been in the low-40% range during the entire period. Ormat Technologies accounts for 29% of U.S. geothermal generation, making it the nation’s second-largest producer of geothermal energy. The U.S. is the world’s largest geothermal-energy producer, with Ormat deriving 72% of its revenues from the U.S. market. Ameresco (AMRC)An image of an internal engine of an EV surrounded by renewable arrows icon; recycling imagerySource: petovarga/shutterstockAmeresco (NYSE:AMRC), which seeks to reduce other firms’ costs by raising their energy efficiency and providing them with renewables, is worth investing in. The truth of that assertion is demonstrated by the company’s tremendous Q2 earnings report.  Ameresco ‘s revenues soared 111% YOY to $481.9 million. The massive spike of its sales caused its EPS to spike 135% YOY, while its EBITDA, excluding some items, jumped 75% to $60.3 million. Fundamentally speaking, AMRC is performing very strongly.However, Ameresco’s shares fell immediately following the Fed’s latest 0.75 percentage point rate hike. That has brought its share prices down to a better entry point near $68. The shares had been fully priced prior to the news, indicating that investors were bullish on Ameresco despite the prevailing economic conditions. The shares’ resiliency suggests that AMRC stock has the potential to perform well moving forward. Clearway Energy (CWEN)A wind turbine appears in silhouette against a bright orange and blue sky.Source: Khanthachai C / Shutterstock.comThe sale of Clearway Energy’s (NYSE:CWEN) thermal business on May 1 produced a big return for the company, as it yielded a gain of $1.29 billion. The deal also enabled Clearway Energy’s Q2 EPS to reach $5.49, versus Wall Street analysts’ average estimate of 49 cents. Clearway Energy owns 7,710 megawatts of energy production capacity. Of that total, 5,238 MW are renewables. The company owns 3,285 MW of wind energy capacity. There are indications that Clearway Energy will invest a large portion of the proceeds from the sale of its thermal business in wind energy. Last year, 32% of U.S. energy capacity growth was attributable to wind energy. That metric suggests that America’s utilization of wind energy should rise rapidly going forward, boosting CWEN stock. Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP)solar and wind power in coastal saline and alkaline land, develop shoals background representing solar stocks.Source: chuyuss / Shutterstock.comBrookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) stock has fared quite well in 2022. From the beginning of the year through Sept. 22, it was essentially flat. In other words, it has suffered no losses while broad indexes like the S&amp;P 500, down 21.5% during the same period, continue to falter. Brookfield Renewable Partners owns and operates a portfolio of hydroelectric, wind, solar, and storage facilities in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. So it’s a good buy for investors seeking a strong play on renewables. In Q2, Brookfield invested $3 billion in projects while commissioning 1,000 megawatts of new power.  Its net income turned positive in Q2, coming in at $1 million, up from a $63 million loss during the same period a year. In the first half of the year, its net loss narrowed to $77 million, down from $196 million in the first six months of  ‘21. ON Semiconductor (ON)a machine manufactures semiconductor chips in a factory setting. Semiconductor stocks to buySource: ShutterstockON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) stock took it on the chin as the Fed raised rates another 75 basis points on Sept. 21. Its shares dropped from above $71 to below $64 in less than 24 hours following the news. The company provides “intelligent power technologies enable the electrification of the automotive industry.”The decline of ON stock isn’t too surprising since tech has accounted for an outsized portion of the stock market’s losses this year. Investors should ignore the short-term, negative catalysts, though, when it comes to ON stock because ON Semiconductor is a strong firm that operates in attractive sectors. Its quarterly revenue recently crossed the $2 billion mark for the first time, creating a particularly strong signal, given the macro challenges.On is well-positioned to grow rapidly along with the EV, automation, and renewable energy sectors. The company’s forward-looking approach has served it well and resulted in record revenues in Q2. It’s worth buying on the dip. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Despite the ongoing worries on Wall Street, seasoned investors realize that there may be a bull market in some segments of the market even during these gloomy weeks.Fears of sticky inflation and recession led to many investors reevaluating their investments or pulling their money out of the stock markets altogether. As a result, the S&amp;P 500 index has dropped 23% year to date, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 has lost close to a third of its value.However, for investors who research further, there is always a chance to find the best stocks to buy in a hidden bull market. Including several of those shares could help boost the performance of investment portfolios despite the overall market chaos.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEven in 2022, with interest rates hitting a 14-year high in the U.S. and stocks getting hammered, we are experiencing localized bull markets in the energy and utility sectors. For instance, the energy sector, overall, has returned around 18% since January.That said, here are seven of the best stocks to buy. These hidden gems could well be poised for a rally in the coming months and offer great upside potential to tap into a hidden bull market.MOAltria $41.47ASRTAssertio$2.15IBBiShares Biotechnology ETF$113.42MMPMagellan Midstream Partners $45.69RIORio Tinto $51.22TSNTyson Foods $68.95VTVVanguard Value ETF$124.96Altria (MO)an array of various styles of vaping devices, KAVL brands makes vapesSource: Shutterstock52-week range: $40.84 – $57.05Altria (NYSE:MO) is the leading producer of combustible and smoke-free products. Its portfolio includes Philip Morris USA, John Middleton, U.S. Smokeless Tobacco, Helix Innovations, and the e-cigarette maker JUUL Labs.In the U.S., its retail market share of cigarette sales is close to 50%. Meanwhile, Altria also holds equity investments in Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) and the cannabinoid company Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON), making one of the best stocks to buy for the long haul.Story continuesThe tobacco play released Q2 financials on July 28. Although net revenue dropped 5.7% year-over-year (YOY), adjusted earnings increased to $1.26 per diluted share. Altria also reaffirmed its full-year 2022 guidance.Meanwhile, investors have welcomed the Juul Labs settlement with 34 U.S. states and territories regarding its marketing practices for vaping products. As question marks around the operations of Juul Labs decline, Altria shares could see a new upside momentum.So far this year, Altria stock has dropped 13% to hit a 52-week low in recent dates. Yet it generates a very lucrative dividend yield of 9%. In late August, management raised Altria’s quarterly dividend by 4.4%.The company’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios are 8.33x and 3.66x, respectively. Analysts’ 12-month median price forecast for MO stock stands at $46.50. Potential investors could consider buying in at the current levels, especially below $40.Assertio (ASRT)rows of pills on a table representing pharmaceutical stocks. EVAX stockSource: Iryna Imago / Shutterstock.com52-week range: $0.85 – $4.44Specialty pharmaceutical company Assertio (NYSE:ASRT) offers therapies mainly in the areas of neurology, pain, and diseases of the central nervous system.The company has seven FDA-approved medications for various conditions. With a market capitalization of just over $100 million, it can be regarded as a high-risk high-return stock.On Aug. 8, ASRT released better-than-expected Q2 results. Net product sales increased 40% compared to the prior-year quarter. Its gout treatments, which do not face generic competition, provide the bulk of its revenues.Driven by sales growth and increased profitability, the company raised its full-year revenue guidance for 2022. The drug maker is also evaluating multiple asset acquisitions to grow and diversify its current pipeline.Recently, management issued $70 million of convertible senior notes due 2027. As a result, Assertio is redeeming earlier higher-interest notes. As the conversion is leading to stock dilution, ASRT shares have sold off, providing a better entry point for long-term investors.ASRT stock has lost about 20% since the beginning of the year. Shares are trading at 5.61 times forward earnings and 0.75 times sales. Meanwhile, Wall Street’s 12-month median price forecast for the stock is $6.Given increasing revenues and expanding margins, Assertio could also become a takeover target in the months ahead.   iShares Biotechnology ETF (IBB)Modern Medical Research Laboratory: Two Scientists Wearing Face Masks use Microscope, Analyse Sample in Petri Dish, Talk.

Trailing P/E and P/B ratios stand at 12.93x and 4.16x, respectively.After hitting a multi-year low in June, the biotech sector has later had a strong rally driven by new drug approvals and M&amp;A news. Thus, IBB is well poised for a rally driven by the ongoing momentum for the remainder of the year. Potential investors could regard a decline toward $110 as a better entry point.Magellan Midstream Partners (MMP)Magellan Midstream Partners (MMP) logo on the website homepage.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $43.58 – $53.75Master limited partnership Magellan Midstream Partners (NYSE:MMP) transports, stores, and distributes refined petroleum products and crude oil in central and eastern U.S.According to Q2 metrics reported in late July, diluted net income per common unit was $1.94, up 40.5% from the year-ago period.

It is also among the leading diamond producers worldwide making it one of the best stocks to buy in the commodities sector.Rio Tinto’s HY1 earnings fell short of analyst expectations. Consolidated sales revenue declined 10% YOY due to softer iron ore prices, which recently saw a multi-month low.Meanwhile, the miner highlighted its focus on the long-term global strategy. These operations include Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia and the Gudai-Darri iron ore mine in Australia as well as the early works funding at the Rincon lithium project.Rio Tinto is also building a new aluminum recycling facility at its Arvida Plant in Quebec to expand its supply of low-carbon aluminum solutions for the automotive, construction, and packaging markets. Thus, RIO shareholders will be paying attention to how diversifying its operations could contribute to the top line.Shares of the mining giant have lost 23% YTD and hit a 52-week low in recent days. RIO stock generates a dividend yield of 13.2% at current prices.Forward P/E and P/S ratios stand at 6.42x and 1.41x. Finally, Wall Street’s 12-month median price forecast for Rio Tinto is $74.31. RIO stock can provide a good bet for value investors looking for potential upside along with passive income.Tyson Foods (TSN)Tyson (TSN Stock) chicken in a package.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com52-week range: $68.99 – $100.72Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) is of the world’s largest protein-focused food companies. Its segments include beef, pork, chicken, and prepared foods. Tyson’s global sales are well over $47 billion, making it one of the best stocks to buy right now.The food giant posted mixed Q3 results on Aug. 8 due to inflationary headwinds. Despite double-digit sales and earnings growth in the first six months, operating income narrowed 27% YOY in Q3. Adjusted EPS of $1.94 also missed analysts’ expectations.Management aims for over $1 billion in savings by fiscal 2024. Steps in its its productivity program include capacity expansion, supply-chain digitalization, and increased automation. Furthermore, two new plants are expected to begin operation in 2022 and six more in the fiscal year 2023. Therefore, Wall Street expects to see both revenue and margin expansion from Tyson Foods in the quarters ahead.So far in 2022, TSN stock has dropped 20% and hit a 52-week low on Sept. 23. It yields a dividend of 2.63%. Shares are trading at 9.13 times forward earnings and 0.49 times sales.Analysts’ 12-month median price forecast stands at $90.

Large-cap stocks.Source: iQoncept / Shutterstock52-week range: $125.19 – $151.89Dividend yield: 3.31%Expense ratio: 0.04% per yearOur final discussion focuses on the Vanguard Value ETF (NYSEARCA:VTV). It provides exposure to large-cap U.S. companies that exhibit value characteristics. It is one of the largest value-focused ETFs with net assets of $143.4 billion.This passively-managed fund started trading in January 2004. It tracks the returns of the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index and has 344 holdings.With regards to sub-sectors, we see health care (20.1%), financials (19%), industrials (13.4%), consumer staples (11.5%), and energy (8.2%), among others. The leading 10 holdings account for around 20% of the fund’s portfolio.UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) are among the most prominent names on the roster.VTV has lost 14% YTD and just hit a 52-week low. The fund is trading at 15.3 times trailing earnings and 2.5 times book values.Many value names in a fund like VTV will likely be among the first to bounce back when the market recovers. Potential investors could regard the current dip in the Vanguard Value ETF as a good entry point. Current investors would also get a yield of about 2.7%.On the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil, Ph.D., did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

A record 5.4 million applications for new businesses were filed with the IRS in 2021, exceeding the 4.4 million applications filed in 2020, which was also a record.Even with this spike in entrepreneurship, many American small businesses are still wrestling with the effects of a global pandemic, supply chain disruptions, staffing strains, economic volatility, sustained inflation, and more.To show up for America's small businesses like they've been showing up for communities across the country, Mastercard is expanding one of its signature small business initiatives into new territory, setting up shop with Strive USA, a new effort under the Strive banner of global programs led by the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth.""Because small businesses are so essential to the U.S. economy, the barriers that stand in the way of their success also stand in the way of shared prosperity and inclusive growth,"" said Shamina Singh, founder and president of the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth. ""The American spirit of entrepreneurship has endured through every challenge of the last few years. Now, we have an opportunity and a responsibility as a community of small business enablers to match their drive to survive and thrive, meeting them at this turning point with support tailored to what they need most. As we see it, empowering small businesses in these targeted ways at this moment in time can create a ripple effect that carries forward the work of building an economy that promises opportunity for everyone, everywhere.""Meeting the momentStrive USA will join together and strengthen an ecosystem of organizations primed to address three common challenges small businesses are confronting:Getting capital: To enable small businesses to access capital more efficiently - particularly those that have been underserved - Strive USA will help Community Financial Institutions (CFIs) expand their impact. According to a 2022 Federal Reserve survey, small businesses owned by people of color were half as likely as white-owned small businesses to report receiving all the traditional financing for which they applied in the previous 12 months.Story continuesGoing digital: To make it easier to do business in the modern marketplace, Strive USA will work with tech-oriented partners to offer tools and resources that help small businesses digitalize their operations and transition to tech-forward ways of working. A recent OECD report outlined several reasons why it's critical for small enterprises to go digital, including that gaps in digital adoption can ultimately ""contribute to increasing inequalities among individuals, firms, communities and places.""Growing networks and know-how: To help small businesses withstand current and future pressures, Strive USA will create opportunities for owners to tap into training, education, and mentorship through connections with expert organizations, primarily at a local level. According to a report by McKinsey, Black entrepreneurs are less likely to know and hear about relevant networks that can help support and promote their businesses - a phenomenon Strive USA will seek to remedy.""Small businesses continue to feel the effects of the pandemic and its aftermath, and through the last two years, it's become glaringly obvious that two things they need to survive are access to capital and a digital operation,"" said Ginger Siegel, North America Small Business Lead at Mastercard. ""We want small businesses to do more than survive - we want them to thrive, and together with our digital tools and resources, cyber solutions, and expansive network of partners, we're able to make a real impact on the individuals and communities they support.""Strengthening an ecosystem of enablersOver the next five years, Strive USA aims to provide support to five million small businesses in the U.S., with a focus on underserved business owners. By forging partnerships and providing grants to organizations working directly with small businesses, Strive USA is envisioned to be a comprehensive resource and rallying force for Main Street.Initial grantees include:CNote: A women-led impact platform that uses technology to unlock diversified community investments to increase economic mobility and financial inclusion.Community Reinvestment Fund, USA (CRF): Supports mission-driven organizations through the development of products and services aimed at increasing the flow of capital to historically underinvested communities across the country.Momentus Capital: Rooted in social mission, Momentus Capital provides a continuum of financial, social, and knowledge capital for small businesses and community development organizations at every growth stage to support economic mobility and wealth creation in underestimated communities.To ensure Strive USA small businesses have wrap-around assistance, the initiative will also work with a diverse set of public, private and social sector partners. Current supporters include Capital One, which continues to offer and build a diverse suite of financial products, tools and services designed specifically for business owners with varying financial needs to help them move their business forward and keep their communities thriving. The company offers support for small businesses by accelerating investments with Black and Hispanic partners and suppliers, expanding mentoring, training and advisory programs for Black and Hispanic businesses and nonprofits, and producing custom research aimed at closing information gaps to advance greater equity and opportunity in the small business ecosystem through the Capital One Insights Center. Capital One will continue to expand access to these tools and solutions through Mastercard's Strive USA initiative.In cooperation with additional partners at the local level, targeted programming will begin in Atlanta, Birmingham, New Orleans, New York City and St. Louis.Supporting small business to build inclusive economiesLaunched in 2021 and led by Mastercard's Center for Inclusive Growth, Strive is an innovative set of global programs tailor-made to support pandemic recovery, growth, and resilience among small businesses. Ongoing Strive initiatives include Strive UK and Strive Community.Strive USA will be carried out in tandem with Mastercard's In Solidarity initiative, which aims to combat racism and bridge the racial wealth and opportunity gap through commitments across three pillars: People, Market and Society. These efforts also complement the Strivers Initiative, which supports Black women-owned businesses across the U.S.What they're sayingCatherine Berman, CEO of CNote: ""There is a tremendous opportunity in the United States today to harness the power of technology to provide transformative financial services to under-resourced communities. Mastercard's leadership in this field has been a game-changer for CNote, and we couldn't be more excited for the launch of Strive USA, which will empower millions of businesses to thrive in the digital economy.""Frank Altman, co-founder and CEO of CRF: ""All of us at CRF are thrilled to expand our partnership with Mastercard. Mastercard understands the important role CDFIs like CRF play in helping small business owners overcome systemic barriers to growth. Together, we can harness innovation and build the digital capacity of small businesses and the organizations that support them.""Ellis Carr, president and CEO of Momentus Capital: ""From lending and technical assistance to impact investments and access to technology, it is important that entrepreneurs of color have access to a continuum of financial, knowledge, and social capital that break down systemic barriers to success. We are excited to have the support of the Mastercard Strive program, which will allow us to provide innovative solutions so that all people and communities have access to the capital and opportunities they deserve.""Media ContactsStacy Day, Mastercard+1 (914) 249-2094 | stacy.day@mastercard.comAbout the Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthThe Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth advances equitable and sustainable economic growth and financial inclusion around the world.

Former President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Beijing’s stringent Covid lockdowns. The US-Sino standoff over Taiwan. Political pressure to “friend-shore” supply chains toward nations aligned with Washington.But breaking up, as the adage goes, is hard to do.That conclusion is evident from a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis of Apple Inc., which is trying to reduce its dependence on China. The Cupertino, California-based company already started producing some iPhone 14 models in India, in an earlier than usual move for new models. And Apple’s largest supplier, Foxconn Technology Group, recently agreed to a $300 million expansion of its production facilities in Vietnam.Read BI’s Report: Untangling US-China Technology Supply Chain Hard, Not ImpossibleBut Bloomberg Intelligence estimates it would take about eight years to move just 10% of Apple’s production capacity out of China, where roughly 98% of the company’s iPhones have been made. Scores of local component suppliers — not to mention modern and efficient transport, communication and electricity supplies — make it particularly difficult to get out of the world’s second-largest economy.“With China accounting for 70% of global smartphone manufacturing and leading Chinese vendors accounting for nearly half of global shipments, the region has a well-developed supply chain, which will be tough to replicate — and one Apple could lose access to if it moves,” BI’s report from analysts Steven Tseng and Woo Jin Ho said.An Apple spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.Story continuesIt’s one thing to look outside China for other makers of toys and t-shirts. But US technology firms invested more than two decades, and tens of billions of dollars, setting up complex production chains to provide essential goods for the e-commerce boom. Unwinding those ties could end up taking just as long, and may result in lasting damage to an already battered global economy.Of course, unanticipated events — like Europe and America’s rupture with Russia — provide a potent reminder of both the systemic risks of deep economic integration and the speed at which decoupling can occur.Political headwinds in the US have been steadily leaning against US-Chinese integration. Under President Joe Biden, the $615 billion US-China trade relationship has simmered into a cold war following the commercial tensions under Trump that resulted in tariffs on a collective $360 billion worth of bilateral goods, along with US sanctions on key Chinese technology manufacturers like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.The pandemic then ushered in President Xi Jinping’s strict virus-containment policies, which essentially barred travel and has left major areas locked down for extended periods of time. Rising tensions over US ties with Taiwan and China’s unprecedented scale of military exercises in the Taiwan Strait have become the latest flashpoint offering a case for decoupling.“There was some momentum in this direction as a consequence of the trade war and the pandemic,” Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said about decoupling. “The Shanghai lockdown was really a monster accelerant. And the cross-strait crisis in early August added more fuel to the fire.”Yet the Biden administration’s reshoring strategy — or “friend-shoring” as termed by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen — remains a lofty but unfulfilled ambition, as far as the data go.US firms had $90 billion directly invested in China at the end of 2020, and despite all the talk of decoupling, added another $2.5 billion in 2021, according to data compiled by China’s commerce ministry. The actual total is likely even higher, because some businesses are thought by analysts to route some investments through Hong Kong, or via tax havens like the Cayman and Virgin Islands.US tech supply chains in China rely on firms from Taiwan and elsewhere as well as domestic Chinese firms, increasing the level of dependence further.Apple CEO Tim Cook stands outside of the Apple Fifth Avenue store for the release of the Apple iPhone 14, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)Friendshoring ReticenceFurthermore, America’s allies aren’t exactly swayed by Yellen’s “friend-shoring” concept. Key US partners like Singapore warned the Biden administration that isolating China could destabilize the global economy and potentially “sleepwalk” the world’s largest economies into a dangerous conflict.“Such actions shut off avenues for regional growth and cooperation, deepen divisions between countries and may precipitate the very conflicts that we all hope to avoid,” Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said following Biden’s visit to the region in May.That’s not to say untangling the tech supply chains that link the US with China isn’t already happening to some extent. A Sept. 23 report from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. found that the share of US tech imports coming directly from China has declined by 10 percentage points since 2017, “mainly on moderating China mobile phone exports.”Apple’s exposure to China is also notably bigger than many others. Amazon.com Inc., HP Inc., Microsoft Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc. also depend on China to produce hardware for servers, storage and networking products, but the extent of their dependence is far below that of Apple.Bloomberg Intelligence says that overall tech-industry dependence could be reduced by 20%-40% “in most cases” by 2030. For hardware and electronic manufacturers, they could reduce their reliance on the Chinese market to 20%-30% over the next decade, BI calculates.The Biden administration is taking a two-pronged approach to weakening economic ties with China that simultaneously incentivizes companies to shift their production via subsidies and penalizes investment in China via tariffs and export controls.This summer, Biden signed two pieces of legislation — the Chips and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act — that contain provisions to help bolster domestic manufacturing of certain strategic goods like semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries and pharmaceuticals.The legislation bars companies that access the program’s $52.7 billion in federal funding from materially expanding production of chips more advanced than 28-nanometers in China — or a country of concern like Russia — for 10 years.Also this year, the US administration expanded curbs on sending US semiconductors to China, with new license requirements to sell chip-making equipment to factories that produce 14-nanometer or more advanced chips.US industry officials are developing contingency plans in anticipation of more barriers to US-China trade and expect the Biden administration to trigger a slate of additional export restrictions sometime this fall.While there’s the potential for a political reset between Biden and Xi on the sidelines of the upcoming Group of 20 leaders summit in Bali, expectations for a grand détente remain low.“I don’t see any breakthroughs coming out of the Xi-Biden meeting,” said Wendy Cutler, a former US trade negotiator and vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute.Meanwhile, private-sector sentiment has also deteriorated.A recent survey from the US-China Business Council found that US firms’ optimism about China has already fallen to a record low and evolving challenges — like China’s Covid Zero policy, power cuts and geopolitical tensions — have caused more than half of surveyed companies to delay or cancel planned investments in China.Nearly a quarter of the survey respondents said they’ve moved segments of their supply chains out of China over the past year.US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said at an event Thursday that even some companies that have been manufacturing in China for decades — for which it would be “very disruptive” to depart the country — are putting plans in place, citing conversations she’s had with chief executives.But it’s not exactly an exodus from China. A common approach has become “China Plus One” — whereby China remains a core production base, and any additional capacity is added in South and Southeast Asian nations like India, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.Last year, US firms pledged to invest about $740 million in Vietnam, the most since 2017 and more than double the amount in 2020.Taiwan itself remains a vital but vulnerable component of US supply chains. Led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., the island currently manufactures more than 90% of the world’s most advanced chips used for military and corporate computing services. Apple, MediaTek and Qualcomm, which control more than 85% of the global handset chip market, all rely on TSMC’s supply.Taiwan is expected to remain the key manufacturing hub for cutting-edge chips over the next five years, according to the Bloomberg Intelligence report.China’s booming market also underscores the opportunity cost for US suppliers. Some 19 of the world’s 20 fastest-growing chip industry firms over the past four quarters, on average, are based in China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.(Updates with comment from US Commerce secretary in second paragraph after ‘China Headaches’ chart.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Unstoppable Dollar Is Wreaking Havoc Everywhere But AmericaJay Powell Needs Investors to Lose MoneyTwitter Is in This Mess Because Jack Dorsey Was Too Busy Being a Bitcoin InfluencerGoogle’s Low-Tech Plan to Solve the Opioid CrisisAs Home Prices Surge, Americans Are Moving to Cheaper Places©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The executive was stopped by Mac while parking a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren, an out-of-production sports car that fetches hundreds of thousands of dollars.When asked what he does for a living, Blevins said, “I have rich cars, play golf and fondle big-breasted women, but I take weekends and major holidays off,” according to the video’s captions. He also touted that he has a “hell of a dental plan.”In reality, Blevins is Apple’s vice president of procurement and is in charge of striking deals with suppliers and partners. He recently worked on the company’s satellite agreement with Globalstar Inc., led negotiations over cellular modems with Qualcomm Inc. and Intel Corp., and has been in charge of driving down the costs of many critical parts that go into Apple’s mobile devices.After an internal investigation into the matter, Blevins’s team -- which included about half a dozen direct reports and several hundred employees -- was removed from his command, according to people familiar with the situation.Blevins, a 22-year veteran of Apple, confirmed the incident to Bloomberg, saying the encounter took place on Aug. 18. “I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize to anyone who was offended by my mistaken attempt at humor,” he said.Story continuesAn Apple spokesman said Thursday that Blevins is departing the Cupertino, California-based company.Blevins has been part of a roughly 100-person group of vice presidents at Apple and one of only about 30 executives that report to either Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook or Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams. Williams has been Blevins’s boss for much of his career, though he briefly reported to Sabih Khan, Apple’s senior vice president of operations, according to the people.It was Williams’s decision for the company and Blevins to part ways, one of the people said. The operating chief will oversee Blevins’s old team, at least for now, according to the person.The TikTok video was taken at a car show that Blevins attended last month in Pebble Beach, California. His remarks in the 25-second clip reference a line from the 1981 movie Arthur, where main character Arthur Bach describes his own career: “I race cars, play tennis and fondle women, but I have weekends off and I am my own boss.”The video garnered more than 40,000 likes on Instagram and 1.3 million views on TikTok. After the clip was published, some members of Apple’s operations and procurement teams reported it to the human resources department, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the situation is private. The company then launched the investigation, they said.The video became a topic of discussion among Apple employees in recent weeks, with some expressing anger about his comments -- especially given that other executives, including Cook and Williams, have publicly championed workforce diversity and the empowerment of women -- according to the people. The video has also begun to spread among employees at some of the company’s key suppliers.Blevins’s departure opens up a void at Apple. He’s been integral to the company’s success over the past two decades, according to employees with knowledge of his work, helping Apple fatten its profit margins and get access to core technologies before rivals. He may be difficult to replace, given his understanding of Apple’s supply chain and his negotiating skills, they said.The Wall Street Journal described him as Apple’s chief cost cutter in a 2020 feature story, saying he goes by “the Blevinator.”(Adds detail on video captions in third paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMillions in Cryptocurrency Vanished as Agents Watched HelplesslyPfizer Needs to Prove It’s Ready to Move On From Covid-19Maine Lobster Union Points the Way for Organizing Gig Economy WorkersThe Unstoppable Dollar Is Wreaking Havoc Everywhere But AmericaBig Pharma Is Chasing a $55 Billion Prize of Safer Blood Thinners©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The call came after reports surfaced earlier in the week that the tech giant would slow iPhone production amid softer-than-expected demand.""We expect material negative estimate revisions driven by weaker consumer demand (Services already in slowdown and we expect products to follow),"" Mohan warned.That downgrade prompted Mohan's colleague at BofA Vivek Arya to highlight the potential risk to shares of Apple's suppliers.Customers shop at an Apple Store on the first day of sale for the Apple iPhone 14 in Beijing, China, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)""We assess the potential impact of Apple unit cuts on semis vendors by analyzing historical Apple exposure to determine average selling prices per iPhone,"" Arya wrote. ""We then reduce consensus iPhone unit estimates by a similar magnitude applied by our BofA IT Hardware team. Our analysis assumes cuts are incremental, though it is possible consensus already includes some weakness in outlook (and note potential for incremental upside from second half content opportunities).""According to Arya, here are the top names in the Apple supplier ecosystem and their exposures to any Apple demand slowdown:High risk (3% to 5% sales downside): Cirrus Logic (CRUS), with an 80% Apple exposure, Skyworks (SWKS), with a 55%-60% exposure, and Qorvo (QRVO), with a 30%-35% exposure.Moderate risk (1% to 2% sales downside): large-cap vendors Qualcomm (QCOM) and Broadcom (AVGO), each with about 20%-25% Apple sales exposure, and iPhone sensor suppliers Coherent (COHR) and Lumentum (LITE), with 5% and 15% sales exposure, respectively.Low risk (less than 1% sales downside): Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI), and NXP Semiconductors (NXP), each with less than 10% Apple exposure.Apple stock is off by more than 7% so far this week, worse than the 2% drop for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Year to date, Apple's stock is down by 20%.Story continuesFurthermore, the impact of a smartphone slowdown may not just be limited to Apple's products, Arya contended. That, in turn, could lead to a broader pullback for producers.""Despite modest Apple cuts, China/Android handset weakness is having a more pronounced impact on the overall smartphone market,"" Arya explained. ""In July, China mobile phone sell-in declined roughly 30% on a MoM/YoY basis, catalyzing BofA Global Tech team to lower CY22/23 smartphone unit declines to -12%/-3% YoY (vs. -10%/+1% prior). ... While Android impacts are broadly known (we highlight QRVO SepQ/DecQ guide on its FQ1 call, representing near $350 million miss), visibility remains limited, and length of corrections remains questionable, creating sustained downside risk.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

We're 10 minutes into today's trading session on this Friday's eve of this Thursday. We're seeing major averages lower across the board for the Dow, the S&amp;P 500, and the NASDAQ.We've got some fresh commentary out from St. Louis, the Fed president, James Bullard, speaking during a virtual forum, saying that markets understood the message from the Fed's latest dot plot, and that shows the Fed expects more tightening this year. For more, let's get to Jared Blikre, who is in studio with us. Jared, what are we seeing so far--JARED BLIKRE: Well--BRAD SMITH: --in today's data?JARED BLIKRE: --the Fed really means it, right, as we've been talking about here. All right, so another down day. And this precedes-- or this follows an up day in the markets that we saw Monday. Turned around Tuesday, turning around to the downside. Here is a two-day action in the NASDAQ. You can see we have now given it all back, plus a little bit. We are in the negative by about just a little bit, 12 basis points for the week.As we were looking at the price action yesterday, a lot of it was facilitated by that big move by the Bank of England, kind of reversing policy. Going to buy bonds for a few weeks to support their markets and potentially their pension systems there. This is the S&amp;P 500 over the last three months. Here's that big August rally that we have. It gave that back and more as well.So could we be due for a bounce here? Very-- a lot of signs, a lot of signs that we could be. But I don't think this is the low just yet. I think Wall Street is kind of in agreement on that. So we'll have to see how all of this evolves. And everybody here knows I'm a big fan of the ICE B of A MOVE Index. This tracks the volatility of the bond market. We've been seeing a lot of bond market volatility recently. And this is a new postpandemic high.Story continuesAnd in fact, if we put five-year chart, actually, so this is almost tying the levels that we saw in the very depths at the very beginning of that pandemic selloff in 2020. Want to get a quick check of the US dollar because the weakness that we were seeing yesterday facilitated that big risk rally. And so that was a consequence of what was happening over there in the Bank of England.You can see we are still within the range yesterday-- not a big movement, so hard to say. If we temporarily have a top in the dollar, which it's very overbought right now, we could have a reversal, which means to the upside, in risk markets. But we'll have to see if anything comes of that.Here's the NASDAQ 100 today. Apple down 3%, Tesla down 3%. Some weakness in the chip stocks. I'm going to go to that board right now, where we can see Nvidia and ASML, Taiwan Semi, AMD, all down more than 3%. So just kind of adding to those substantial losses that we've seen for the month of September and closing the quarter as well, guys.BRIAN SOZZI: Jared Blikre, thanks so much.]"

The storm is one of the costliest and most powerful in US history, with estimates of possible damage in the tens of billions of dollars.Florida, with its theme parks and hundreds miles of pristine beaches on Atlantic and Gulf coasts, is one of the most-visited states by foreign and domestic tourists. That makes the Sunshine State a popular destination for Airbnb guests too, with six cities among the top 10 trending summer domestic destinations this year, including Fort Myers and Cape Coral, both of which were in the eye of the storm.The state is also all too familiar with hurricanes, and gets hit almost twice as much as the next most hurricane-prone state of Texas, according to Universal Property, a casualty insurance company. That’s why Airbnb’s extenuating circumstances policies for cancellations and refunds covers some natural disasters, but not “weather or natural conditions that are common enough to be foreseeable in that location,” and specifically cites Florida’s hurricane season among the exceptions. Expedia Group Inc.’s platform Vrbo also won’t cover natural disasters or events beyond a home owner’s control.Read more about Hurricane Ian’s resumed strength as its storm path heads out over the oceanStory continuesThe Fort Myers area on the Gulf Coast, which took a direct hit from Ian, has roughly 2,800 active short-term rentals across Airbnb and Vrbo, according to industry data tracker AirDNA. Given its waterfront real estate, 97% of all listings are full-home vacation rentals.Bret Tracy, a 48-year-old sales director from South Carolina, has a town home in Tampa, about a two-hours drive north of Fort Myers, which he rents on Airbnb when he’s not staying there. Tracy was set to have a guest stay in his home during a local convention, which was subsequently canceled and Tampa was put under an evacuation order. Under Tracy’s normal refund policy, the guest would have only been eligible for a half-refund, but he granted a full one.“In this situation, understanding the magnitude of it, we just said if you initiate it on your side we’ll grant you a full refund,” he said. “I don’t want to put anyone in harm’s way.”The arrival of Hurricane Ian is another example of the delicate balance that home-sharing companies try to strike between hosts, about half of whom make a living by renting out their properties, and guests, who often must pay upfront. During the early days of the pandemic, Airbnb came under fire from guests who were refused refunds as the onus was put on hosts to be accommodating. Airbnb then rolled back that policy, allowing guests full refunds, sparking the ire of hosts who were facing empty calendars and looming mortgage payments. Over the past few years, Airbnb has tried to appease both sides, by adding AirCover, which regulates cancellation policies, listing inaccuracies and other troubles, for both parties.While the extenuating circumstances policy excludes the hurricanes, Airbnb says guests can filter their searches for homes with flexible cancellation policies that offer full refunds as well as purchase travel insurance. The company is also allowing hosts to cancel reservations without penalty.For many hosts in an Airbnb Facebook group, the question of whether to refund a guest during a hurricane was a no-brainer. A post asking about whether other hosts gave refunds drew more than 240 comments from sympathetic home-owners. “We fully refunded our guest,” Mary Singleton commented on the site. “We had to ask them to leave because the area was under mandatory evacuation, so we could prepare the house for the storm. This is a major hurricane and we didn’t think twice about refunding.”Another host named Brian Wilson said he tends to be “a fairly cutthroat business person. But the day I sacrifice my morals for money is the day I’m walking away. It’s an emergency.”Other hosts recalled issuing refunds during past natural disasters, including Hurricane Agatha in Mexico in May, or during wildfires in other states.Some guests, however, haven’t been as lucky to have such accommodating hosts. Rebecca Lopez, a 38-year-old administrative assistant from Tannersville, Pennsylvania, was supposed to travel from Philadelphia to Orlando on Thursday for a family event, but her flight was canceled. Lopez had rented an Airbnb for $600 for the trip, but the property manager and owner refused to refund her money, telling her to contact Airbnb instead.“They’re each pointing the finger at one another and each refusing to help me,” Lopez said. “I have not had an issue before. I’m so shocked this is happening considering the extenuating circumstances of it.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMillions in Cryptocurrency Vanished as Agents Watched HelplesslyPfizer Needs to Prove It’s Ready to Move On From Covid-19Maine Lobster Union Points the Way for Organizing Gig Economy WorkersThe Unstoppable Dollar Is Wreaking Havoc Everywhere But AmericaBig Pharma Is Chasing a $55 Billion Prize of Safer Blood Thinners©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support, Philadelphia, PA provided the award.Valued at $168.8 million, the contract is scheduled to be completed by September 2024. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will repair two flight control surfaces used on the F/A-18E/F and E/A-18G aircraft.The majority of the work in relation to this contract will be carried out in Jacksonville, FL.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during the 2021-2026 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 1.9% over 2021’s reported figure.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.4%. The company has a solid four-quarter earnings surprise of 64.46%, on average.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Textron Aviation’s military trainer and defense aircraft include the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXT’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 6% from the 2021 reported figure.Price MovementShares of Boeing have lost 39.3% in the past 12 months compared with the industry’s decline of 21.1%Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankBoeing currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Valued at $31.8 million, the contract is projected to be completed by September 2025.Details of the DealThe modification contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. The deal involves the delivery of spare parts to support SEWIP Program Block 3 full-rate production. The work will be carried out at multiple locations, with the majority of it to be accomplished in Baltimore, MD.Importance of SEWIP Block 3The rising threat of missile attacks has been fueling the demand for an effective electronic attack system that excels in defeating inbound threats.In this context, Northrop Grumman’s SEWIP enjoys significant demand as it boasts features that protect surface ships from anti-ship missiles, providing early detection, signal analysis and threat warning. NOC’s SEWIP is an upgrade to the legacy AN/SLQ-32 system, and provides game-changing capability for non-kinetic electronic attack options to the U.S. fleet.Such advantages of the electronic warfare system make it attractive for military, thus resulting in NOC winning orders for the same, like the latest one. This, in turn, is likely to boost the revenue-generation prospects of the company from the SEWIP electronic warfare system.Growth ProspectsCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats. To this end, an effective electronic warfare system that ensures anti-missile solution features is likely to witness a pent-up demand.Per a report from the GlobalNewsWire firm, the global electronic warfare system market is projected to witness a CAGR of 6.2% through 2028. Such growth prospects may benefit Northrop Grumman as its SEWIP Block 3 product already has an established position in the electronic warfare system market.Story continuesThe abounding growth prospects should also benefit defense majors who have forayed into the laser-based countermeasure system like Lockheed Martin LMT, L3Harris Technologies LHX and General Dynamcis GD.Lockheed Martin’s Advanced Off-Board Electronic Warfare (“AOEW”) program delivers persistent electronic surveillance and attack capability against naval threats like anti-ship missile (ASM). Its AOEW Active Mission Payload AN/ALQ-248 system is a self-contained electronic warfare pod hosted by the MH-60R or MH-60S Seahawk helicopter, which provides the Navy with advanced ASM detection and response capabilities.Lockheed Martin’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 5.5%. Shares of LMT have returned 15.9% value to investors in the past year.L3Harris’ Viper Shield all-digital electronic warfare suite is custom designed to be a baseline on advanced F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft and maximize their survivability and mission success. Some of its other product range include AN/ALQ-161A, AN / ALQ-211 CV-22, NH 90, AND F-16 self-protection system, AN / ALQ-214 (IDECM) F/A-18 countermeasure system, etc.The long-term growth rate of L3Harris is pegged at 3.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LHX 2022 earnings suggests growth of 3.9% from the prior-year reported figure.Since many years, General Dynamics has been performing as the Lead Systems Integrator for SEWIP Block 1. Its SEWIP, a spiral-block development program, provides an immediate improvement for the legacy surface ship electronic warfare detection and countermeasure system, the AN/SLQ-32.General Dynamics boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.2%.

143,096f2fea-8164-3f96-8e0a-1c910953b1b7,PHM,2022-09-30,Is PulteGroup (PHM) a Suitable Stock for Value Investors?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-phm-suitable-stock-value-133501261.html,1664458501,STORY,"['PHM', '^GSPC']","[Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put PulteGroup, Inc. PHM stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, PulteGroup has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 4.44, as you can see in the chart below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&amp;P 500 stands at about 16.82. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, PulteGroup’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint (which is 9.30) over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands well below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it can be a solid entry point.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Construction sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 9.64. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe should also point out that PulteGroup has a forward PE  ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 3.37, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for PulteGroup stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, PulteGroup has a P/S ratio of about 0.63. This is a bit lower than the S&amp;P 500 average, which comes in at 3.36x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, PulteGroup currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20%  of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes PulteGroup a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.What About the Stock Overall?Though PulteGroup might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of C. This gives PHM a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here &gt;&gt;)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been dismal at best. The current quarter has seen no estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower, while the full year estimate has seen none up and two down in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 0.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action  for the stock in the chart below:PulteGroup, Inc. Price and ConsensusPulteGroup, Inc. Price and ConsensusPulteGroup, Inc. price-consensus-chart | PulteGroup, Inc. QuoteThis negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LinePulteGroup is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 3% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.RWE AG has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while WEC Energy Group has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This means that RWEOY's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.RWEOY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.03, while WEC has a forward P/E of 21.77. We also note that RWEOY has a PEG ratio of 2.47. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. WEC currently has a PEG ratio of 3.58.Another notable valuation metric for RWEOY is its P/B ratio of 2.55. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, WEC has a P/B of 2.63.These metrics, and several others, help RWEOY earn a Value grade of A, while WEC has been given a Value grade of C.RWEOY sticks out from WEC in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that RWEOY is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 2.11%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.54%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.3%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the medical device company had lost 6.06% over the past month. This has lagged the Medical sector's loss of 4.04% and was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's loss of 8.19% in that time.Medtronic will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Medtronic to post earnings of $1.28 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 3.03%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $7.72 billion, down 1.58% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $5.53 per share and revenue of $31.56 billion, which would represent changes of -0.36% and -0.38%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Medtronic. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell).

Merck said in a statement that it was pleased with the decision.Sales of Januvia and Janumet topped $5.2 billion last year. A Merck annual report said its patents on the drugs will expire in January, but the patent at issue, on a salt form of the drugs' active ingredient, would keep generics in that form off the market until at least 2027.Merck's February report said it had already settled disputes over the diabetes drugs with 21 other companies, allowing them to make generics starting in 2026.Merck sued for patent infringement in West Virginia in 2019 after Mylan applied for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to make generic Januvia and Janumet. Mylan challenged the validity of parts of the patent at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.The PTO's Patent Trial and Appeal Board was unconvinced by Mylan's argument that Merck's patent was invalid based on an earlier patent and other publications that supposedly disclosed the same form of the drugs.A federal judge in West Virginia found last week that Mylan infringed the patent.The Federal Circuit agreed with the board that the patent was valid on Thursday. It rejected Mylan's arguments that Merck's patent would have been obvious based on the earlier publications Mylan cited.The case is Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc v.

A sign in one of the photos said ""C919 aircraft type certificate issuance ceremony"" in Chinese.COMAC did not respond immediately to a request for comment.The C919, launched 14 years ago and designed to carry up to 168 passengers, will compete against the popular Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX families in the world's second-biggest aviation market as China looks to boost its technological self-reliance amid trade tensions.Although the plane is assembled in China, it relies heavily on Western components, including engines and avionics, from companies including GE, Safran and Honeywell International.Tough U.S. export licensing rules have led to delays in sourcing parts and remain a key risk to ramped up production until China replaces foreign engines and components with homegrown technology.Richard Aboulafia, U.S.-based managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, said the plane seems like a relic of a bygone era of increasing integration between China and the West.""Thus, we have an aircraft that is only superficially Chinese but is actually powered by Western technologies and systems,"" he said. ""Turning it into a genuine Chinese aircraft would take well over a decade and many billions of dollars.""The type of certificate granted on Thursday means it can be delivered to the first customer, China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd , though local media have reported the plane is unlikely to enter commercial service with passengers until next year.Story continuesThe C919 has never made an appearance at the country's premier aviation event, Airshow China and it is unclear whether it will be on display or flown at the show in November.COMAC will also need a separate production certificate before it can ramp up mass production of the plane, meaning its impact on the global aircraft market could remain limited given Airbus and Boeing produce dozens of narrowbodies a month.""The C919 will gradually begin to replace single-aisle aircraft made by Boeing and Airbus,"" in China, a research note by Huaxi Securities said this month. ""In the next 20 years, China's demand for narrowbody passenger aircraft like the C919 will be on average 300 per year.""The C919's regional jet predecessor, the ARJ21, faced a 2.5-year gap between obtaining the type certificate and the production certificate, slowing production. That contrasts with the West, where both certificates are typically granted around the same time.FOREIGN CERTIFICATIONLike the ARJ21, the C919 lacks certification validation by U.S. and European regulators, limiting flights to the domestic market and possibly countries with close ties to China.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has been working for years on a certification validation process on the C919 with COMAC in parallel to CAAC's work, an EASA spokesperson said.""We cannot comment on the date when this validation would be completed,"" the spokesperson said.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration did not respond to a request for comment on a potential C919 certification validation.There have been 815 orders for the C919 from 28 customers, according to COMAC's website. But China Eastern is the only customer that has announced a firm delivery schedule and it expects to receive only four next year.In the meantime, the Boeing 737 MAX has yet to return to commercial service in China, having been grounded since March 2019 after two fatal crashes.However, three months ago major Chinese airlines placed an order for nearly 300 Airbus A320neo family planes, showing the country plans to continue imports for some time.Aboulafia said if China did decide to halt Western aircraft imports, the United States and allied countries could kill the C919 for years by prohibiting component exports.""Try building an aircraft without an engine, or avionics,"" he said. ""It would just be a metal shell.""(Reporting by Sophie Yu in Beijing and Stella Qiu and Jamie Freed in Sydney Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington Editing by David Goodman, Gerry Doyle and Frances Kerry)]"

(NASDAQ: ILMN), a global leader in DNA sequencing and array-based technologies, today announced multiple breakthrough sequencing innovations at its inaugural Illumina Genomics Forum:Today, Illumina CEO Francis deSouza made several exciting product announcements, including the groundbreaking NovaSeq X Series sequencing platforms. The announcements were made live from the Illumina Genomics Forum in San Diego, Calif.The launch of NovaSeq™ 6000 Dx as the first FDA-registered and CE-marked in vitro diagnostic (IVD) high-throughput sequencer, delivering the highest standards of compliance and driving actionable insights for patient care. This technology expands the breadth of applications and clinical testing in countries that require IVD products, increasing access to clinical genomics with scalable throughput, while also achieving significant reductions in cost/Gb and total cost of ownership. NovaSeq 6000 Dx is an open platform, with RUO and IVD modes and a dedicated DRAGEN™ server, resulting in flexible, high-quality, automated data processing that will minimize the time and labor required to complete projects.Illumina® Complete Long-Reads, formerly known as Infinity, will accelerate access to the remaining 5% of genic regions with a scalable, high-throughput, low DNA-input long read technology. Further, the technology provides a complete and accurate representation of the genome at the single molecule level without needing a new platform. In addition, it offers contiguous long reads to close key gaps. Two products will be launched with full end-to-end workflows in 2023. The first product, currently in early access, is a whole-genome assay that uses long contiguous reads to further extend the coverage and completeness of our existing 30x genome. The second is an enrichment panel targeting only the difficult to map regions of the genome. When combined with the 30x genome on NovaSeq 6000 and NovaSeq X Series, the panel delivers a significant improvement in throughput and cost versus on-market long read technology for human whole-genome sequencing.Story continuesThe creation of XLEAP-SBS™ Chemistry, formerly referred to as Chemistry X, delivers fundamentally new sequencing by synthesis (SBS) chemistry engineered for increased speed, greater fidelity, and more robustness. With up to 2x faster incorporation speed up to 3x greater accuracy, and engineered for longer reads, XLEAP-SBS Chemistry opens incredible possibilities for the future Illumina roadmap and enables new thermostable reagents to support ambient-temperature shipping.With a current install base of more than 1,250 units, the NextSeq™ 1000/2000 Roadmap will deliver a new, higher output P4 flow cell and XLEAP-SBS Chemistry in early 2024. The addition of XLEAP-SBS chemistry and P4 flow cells, anticipated to generate 500Gb of output, will enhance sequencing capabilities, expanding application breadth of the platforms while lowering sequencing costs and improving performance. These kits will follow the forthcoming release of 2x300bp kits, which are currently in early access and scheduled to ship broadly later this year.NovaSeq X Series (NovaSeq X and NovaSeq X Plus), unveiled earlier today, ushers in the era of the genome with revolutionary new production-scale sequencers that will push the limits of what is possible with genomic medicine, enabling faster, more powerful, and more sustainable sequencing. Using revolutionary new technology, NovaSeq X Plus can generate more than 20,000 whole genomes per year – 2.5 times the throughput of prior sequencers – greatly accelerating genomic discovery and clinical insights, to understand disease and ultimately transform patient lives. NovaSeq X also utilizes groundbreaking innovations that significantly reduce waste and environmental impact, reflecting Illumina's commitment to using its technology to support the health of people and the planet. NovaSeq X features a 90% reduction in packaging waste and weight and a 50% reduction in plastic usage compared to NovaSeq 6000.

173,f2aa3a3d-8bbc-3a6f-ad33-0a661b630984,MAA,2022-09-30,Improve Your Retirement Income with These 3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/improve-retirement-income-3-top-131001790.html,1664457001,STORY,"['INGR', 'MAA-PI']","[Here's a revealing data point: older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself.Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.In today's economic environment, traditional income investments are not working.For example, 10-year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6.50%, which translated to an income source you could count on. However, today's yield is much lower and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements.The effect of this drop in rates is substantial: over 20 years, the change in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is over $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.Unfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?Invest in Dividend StocksAs we see it, dividend-paying stocks from generally low-risk, top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant low risk, low yielding Treasury and fixed-income alternatives.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.A rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Ingredion (INGR) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.71 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.14%. This compares to the Food - Miscellaneous industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.81%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 1.56%. Check Ingredion (INGR) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Kilroy Realty (KRC) is paying out a dividend of $0.54 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 4.79% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.48% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 4% over the past year. Check Kilroy Realty (KRC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $1.25 per share, Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) has a dividend yield of 3.21%. This is compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield of 3.3% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 6.1%. Check Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Overall, that is true. But stocks are a broad class, and you can reduce the risks significantly by selecting high-quality dividend stocks that can generate regular, predictable income and can also decrease the volatility of your portfolio compared to the overall stock market.Combating the impact of inflation is one advantage of owning these dividend-paying stocks. Here's why: many of these stable, high-quality companies increase their dividends over time, which translates to rising dividend income that offsets the effects of inflation.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're thinking, ""I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,"" make sure to do your homework. It's important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges.Bottom LineRegardless of whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, looking for a steady stream of income from dividend-paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The call came after reports surfaced earlier in the week that the tech giant would slow iPhone production amid softer-than-expected demand.""We expect material negative estimate revisions driven by weaker consumer demand (Services already in slowdown and we expect products to follow),"" Mohan warned.That downgrade prompted Mohan's colleague at BofA Vivek Arya to highlight the potential risk to shares of Apple's suppliers.Customers shop at an Apple Store on the first day of sale for the Apple iPhone 14 in Beijing, China, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)""We assess the potential impact of Apple unit cuts on semis vendors by analyzing historical Apple exposure to determine average selling prices per iPhone,"" Arya wrote. ""We then reduce consensus iPhone unit estimates by a similar magnitude applied by our BofA IT Hardware team. Our analysis assumes cuts are incremental, though it is possible consensus already includes some weakness in outlook (and note potential for incremental upside from second half content opportunities).""According to Arya, here are the top names in the Apple supplier ecosystem and their exposures to any Apple demand slowdown:High risk (3% to 5% sales downside): Cirrus Logic (CRUS), with an 80% Apple exposure, Skyworks (SWKS), with a 55%-60% exposure, and Qorvo (QRVO), with a 30%-35% exposure.Moderate risk (1% to 2% sales downside): large-cap vendors Qualcomm (QCOM) and Broadcom (AVGO), each with about 20%-25% Apple sales exposure, and iPhone sensor suppliers Coherent (COHR) and Lumentum (LITE), with 5% and 15% sales exposure, respectively.Low risk (less than 1% sales downside): Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI), and NXP Semiconductors (NXP), each with less than 10% Apple exposure.Apple stock is off by more than 7% so far this week, worse than the 2% drop for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Year to date, Apple's stock is down by 20%.Story continuesFurthermore, the impact of a smartphone slowdown may not just be limited to Apple's products, Arya contended. That, in turn, could lead to a broader pullback for producers.""Despite modest Apple cuts, China/Android handset weakness is having a more pronounced impact on the overall smartphone market,"" Arya explained. ""In July, China mobile phone sell-in declined roughly 30% on a MoM/YoY basis, catalyzing BofA Global Tech team to lower CY22/23 smartphone unit declines to -12%/-3% YoY (vs. -10%/+1% prior). ... While Android impacts are broadly known (we highlight QRVO SepQ/DecQ guide on its FQ1 call, representing near $350 million miss), visibility remains limited, and length of corrections remains questionable, creating sustained downside risk.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

177,316a1f32-9936-37ab-9d1c-bdbfd0c6a464,NOC,2022-09-30,Boeing (BA) Wins $169M Deal to Assist F/A-18E/F & E/A-18G Jets,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-ba-wins-169m-deal-162204437.html,1664468524,STORY,"['BA', 'TXT', 'LMT', 'NOC']","[The Boeing Company BA recently secured a contract involving the F/A-18E/F and E/A-18G combat jets. The Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support, Philadelphia, PA provided the award.Valued at $168.8 million, the contract is scheduled to be completed by September 2024. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will repair two flight control surfaces used on the F/A-18E/F and E/A-18G aircraft.The majority of the work in relation to this contract will be carried out in Jacksonville, FL.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during the 2021-2026 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 1.9% over 2021’s reported figure.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.4%. The company has a solid four-quarter earnings surprise of 64.46%, on average.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Textron Aviation’s military trainer and defense aircraft include the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.5%.

Valued at $31.8 million, the contract is projected to be completed by September 2025.Details of the DealThe modification contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. The deal involves the delivery of spare parts to support SEWIP Program Block 3 full-rate production. The work will be carried out at multiple locations, with the majority of it to be accomplished in Baltimore, MD.Importance of SEWIP Block 3The rising threat of missile attacks has been fueling the demand for an effective electronic attack system that excels in defeating inbound threats.In this context, Northrop Grumman’s SEWIP enjoys significant demand as it boasts features that protect surface ships from anti-ship missiles, providing early detection, signal analysis and threat warning. NOC’s SEWIP is an upgrade to the legacy AN/SLQ-32 system, and provides game-changing capability for non-kinetic electronic attack options to the U.S. fleet.Such advantages of the electronic warfare system make it attractive for military, thus resulting in NOC winning orders for the same, like the latest one. This, in turn, is likely to boost the revenue-generation prospects of the company from the SEWIP electronic warfare system.Growth ProspectsCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats. To this end, an effective electronic warfare system that ensures anti-missile solution features is likely to witness a pent-up demand.Per a report from the GlobalNewsWire firm, the global electronic warfare system market is projected to witness a CAGR of 6.2% through 2028. Such growth prospects may benefit Northrop Grumman as its SEWIP Block 3 product already has an established position in the electronic warfare system market.Story continuesThe abounding growth prospects should also benefit defense majors who have forayed into the laser-based countermeasure system like Lockheed Martin LMT, L3Harris Technologies LHX and General Dynamcis GD.Lockheed Martin’s Advanced Off-Board Electronic Warfare (“AOEW”) program delivers persistent electronic surveillance and attack capability against naval threats like anti-ship missile (ASM). Its AOEW Active Mission Payload AN/ALQ-248 system is a self-contained electronic warfare pod hosted by the MH-60R or MH-60S Seahawk helicopter, which provides the Navy with advanced ASM detection and response capabilities.Lockheed Martin’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 5.5%. Shares of LMT have returned 15.9% value to investors in the past year.L3Harris’ Viper Shield all-digital electronic warfare suite is custom designed to be a baseline on advanced F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft and maximize their survivability and mission success. Some of its other product range include AN/ALQ-161A, AN / ALQ-211 CV-22, NH 90, AND F-16 self-protection system, AN / ALQ-214 (IDECM) F/A-18 countermeasure system, etc.The long-term growth rate of L3Harris is pegged at 3.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LHX 2022 earnings suggests growth of 3.9% from the prior-year reported figure.Since many years, General Dynamics has been performing as the Lead Systems Integrator for SEWIP Block 1. Its SEWIP, a spiral-block development program, provides an immediate improvement for the legacy surface ship electronic warfare detection and countermeasure system, the AN/SLQ-32.General Dynamics boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.2%. GD stock has appreciated 12.5% in the past year.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Northrop Grumman have rallied 34.3% against the industry’s decline of 19.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankNorthrop Grumman currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Nike executives believe inventory issues will be normalized by the end of its current fiscal quarter, but investors appear wary amid a sector-wide inventory pile up and increased discounting.“We plan to compete… in a more promotional environment,” Nike CFO Matt Friend said on Thursday’s earnings call. “And given the macro uncertainty that's out there for the consumer, we're taking a more measured approach and we're tightening our inventory buys around the world based on some of the risks that could materialize in the second half.”Nike stock (NKE) fell more than 12% as of the market close on Friday and was down more than 50% so far in 2022 entering the last trading day of the third quarter.Nike reported revenue of $12.69 billion for the first quarter, up 4% from last year and beating analyst estimates. The company's $0.93 adjusted earnings per share came in slightly higher than analyst expectations — but fell 22% compared to the same quarter last year.Growing strength in the U.S. dollar also proved to be a laggard for Nike in the first quarter and could be moving forward as well. Currency changes drove down reported revenue by 16% in Europe and 12% in Asia Pacific and Latin America. After exchanges, the company reported just 1% growth in Europe while Asia Pacific and Latin America remained flat.“Headwinds from foreign exchange have also shifted significantly in the last 90 days as the trend of U.S. dollar strengthening has accelerated,” Friend said on the earnings call.Story continuesOn the bright side, Nike showed signs of growth in its direct-to-consumer business with sales up 8%.“Nike has a very strong brand that’s why we rate it as a wide moat company,” Swartz said. “We say it has a competitive advantage because people do love Nike products and they do sell a lot of them at very good prices. Nike has to do discounting and it will continue the next couple quarters. But generally, I don’t see them having to do a huge amount of discounting.”Santa Claus shows off the Nike Air Kringle shoes in a 2015 ad. (screenshot/ESPN via SneakerFiles)And despite acknowledging how the gloomy macroeconomic could impact consumer demand, the retailer didn’t waiver on its forward revenue guidance — something that analysts had feared prior to the report. Friend noted that Nike met its internal guidance for double-digit revenue growth in the first quarter and now has its sights set on “low double digit” growth in the coming quarter.“We're coming off a strong quarter and we feel very good about our competitive position, and we have not yet seen any signs of slowdown,” Nike President and CEO John Donahoe said on the earnings call. “That said, we don't have any crystal ball around the external factors, whether it's FX, whether it's inflation, whether it's the impact of energy prices on consumer spending.”Josh is a reporter and producer for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest trending stock tickers of the Yahoo Finance platformClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

REUTERS/Sergio Perez (SPAIN)What Wall Street is saying:BMO Capital Markets Managing Director Simeon SiegelRating: Outperform (reiterated)Price Target: $110 (down from $128)""In what's becoming a painful cycle, Nike again beat revenue/EPS, but missed margins and guided down. N.A. sales beat, but on heavily-compressed margins, with ongoing declines ahead; which begs the question, Why force revenues if they drive earnings before interest, taxes [EBIT] declines? Sell less, Charge more, Make more. And importantly, although direct-to-consumer [DTC] grew, both gross margin and EBIT rates (and dollars) declined (again), furthering our fears of misplaced DTC expectations. Although we still see its scale as long-term competitive advantage, for today, Nike looks increasingly like other over-inventoried promo-chasing retailers.""Jefferies Managing Director Randal KonikRating: Buy (reiterated)Price Target: $115 (down from $130)Story continues""While some near-term pain ahead, long-term remains attractive. Nike is one of the best-known brands out there, and its distribution model is moving swiftly towards DTC. Despite inflationary pressures impacting all companies, we believe Nike remains well-positioned. Therefore, we believe shares are attractive as the stock currently trades at ~22x FY'2 P/E, below the company's 5-year average of ~29x.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

As organizations face skills gaps, security challenges, and compliance obstacles, less than one-quarter of respondents across the globe manage their hybrid cloud environments holistically – which can create blind spots and put data at risk.Hybrid Cloud imageThe IBM Transformation Index: State of Cloud commissioned by IBM and conducted by independent research firm, The Harris Poll, was created to help organizations map their cloud transformation and empower them to self-classify their progress. Built on a foundation that leverages insights from experienced cloud professionals, enterprises can use the Index to gain measurable metrics that can help quantify their progress and uncover areas of opportunity and growth. The Index consisted of more than 3,000 business and technology decision-makers from 12 countries and across 15 industries including financial services, manufacturing, government, telecommunications and healthcare, to understand where organizations are advancing, or merely emerging, on their transformation journeys.The Index points to a strong correlation between hybrid cloud adoption and progress in digital transformation. In fact, 71% of those surveyed think it's difficult to realize the full potential of a digital transformation without having a solid hybrid cloud strategy in place. At the same time, only 27% of those surveyed possess the necessary characteristics to be considered as ""advanced"" in their transformation. So, why the disconnect? A sampling of findings include:Story continuesCompliance: Businesses believe ensuring compliance in the cloud is currently too difficult – especially as we see enforcement of regulatory and compliance requirements heat up across the globe.Security: While businesses have embraced a variety of security techniques to secure workloads in the cloud, concerns about security still remain.Skills: As organizations face the realities of a talent shortage, they are failing to implement a holistic hybrid cloud strategy – which can create gaps in security and compliance and cause risk across cloud environments.""As we see regulatory requirements grow across the globe, compliance is top of mind for business leaders. This concern is even greater for those in highly regulated industries. Yet at the same time, they are facing a growing threat landscape – one that demands holistic management of their multicloud environments to avoid the risks of a Frankencloud – an environment that's so disconnected, it's difficult to navigate and can be nearly impossible to secure, particularly against third and fourth party risks,"" said Howard Boville, Head of IBM Cloud Platform. ""An integration strategy to bring together these different piece parts is what we believe separates the leaders from the rest of the pack – the alternative is to pay the price of the Frankencloud.""""The key value of cloud for businesses is rapid access to innovative technologies, data sources, and applications required to navigate current disruptions and transform businesses. No individual cloud can address all of an enterprise's requirements, so they must be able to use and effectively control hybrid cloud assets across many locations. IBM with its focus on providing a holistic hybrid cloud strategy is well positioned to help organizations address the security, data management and compliance complexities that can prevent them from taking full advantage of cloud innovation,"" says Rick Villars, Group Vice President of Worldwide Research at IDC.The 2022 IBM Transformation Index: State of Cloud revealed:Lack of the right skills is inhibiting progress  When it comes to managing their cloud applications, 69% of respondents say their team lacks the skills needed to be proficient. This is a major roadblock to innovation, with more than a quarter of respondents saying skills and talent shortages are impeding their business's cloud objectives. The effects don't stop here – these limitations are also preventing organizations from leveraging the power of partnerships. More than one-third of respondents say a lack of technical skills is holding them back from integrating ecosystem partners into cloud environments. This challenge is even greater in the US, where nearly 40% admit to this lack of skills – pointing to the need for talent.Exposure to cyberthreats continues to lurk despite embracing security techniques While more than 90% of responding financial services, telecommunications and government organizations have adopted security tools such as confidential computing capabilities, multifactor authentication and more, gaps remain that are preventing organizations from driving innovation. In fact, 32% of overall respondents cite security as the top barrier for integrated workloads across environments and more than one quarter of respondents agree security concerns present a roadblock to achieving their cloud business goals.Security concerns can even hold organizations back from unlocking the full potential of partnerships. As potential security gaps can cause third and fourth party risks to loom, respondents say data governance (49%) and cybersecurity (47%) are the top challenges to fully integrating their business ecosystem into the cloud. In Brazil, cyberthreats are an even greater concern to ecosystem innovation -- 51% say cybersecurity risks pose a major challenge for businesses that want to integrate business ecosystem partners into cloud environments.Regulatory and compliance requirements remain center stage causing businesses to pause With regulations on the rise, so too are compliance challenges. 53% of respondents believe that ensuring compliance in the cloud is currently too difficult and nearly one-third cite regulatory compliance issues as a key barrier for integrating workloads across private and public IT environments. In financial services, for example, more than a quarter of respondents agree that meeting industry requirements is holding them back from fully achieving their cloud objectives. These challenges span the globe and are especially prevalent in countries such as Singapore, China, India and Japan.Based on the Index, IBM will launch an interactive tool to serve as a continual source of feedback for organizations to measure their transformation progress. With the ability to help companies assess how they fare against others; the tool will allow them to identify areas where transformation is stalled and where it may be excelling – unlocking the ability to diagnose and act with efficiency even against the real-world of complexity of cloud transformation.IBM will make the IBM Transformation Index: State of Cloud tool publicly available in the coming months, aiming to provide business leaders with valuable benchmarking insights that can inform their hybrid cloud strategies. The IBM Institute for Business Value also published a new report, ""A Comparative Look at Enterprise Cloud Strategy"" with an action guide for how leaders can use the Index to help advance their organizations' digital transformation.Singapore Fact SheetThe IBM Transformation Index: State of Cloud points to a strong correlation between hybrid cloud adoption and progress in digital transformation - 77% of those surveyed in Singapore think it's difficult to realize the full potential of a digital transformation without having a solid hybrid cloud strategy in place. (Global is 71%)Hybrid cloud offers the power of choice – enabling enterprises to host workloads wherever they need to be. Industry clouds such as IBM Cloud for Financial Services are key to a successful hybrid cloud strategy for enterprises in highly regulated industries to reduce risk while driving innovation.Enterprises aren't holistically managing their hybrid cloud infrastructures for a number of reasons - concerns over security, skills, and compliance. These concerns are getting in the way of reaching the full potential of the hybrid cloud – creating blind spots that can put data at risk. The conversation has shifted – it's no longer hybrid, it's how to do it better to derive business value.In Singapore, hybrid cloud is the dominant architecture, but enterprises aren't holistically managing their infrastructures for several reasons - concerns over security, skills, and more. More than three-quarters (77%) of those surveyed in Singapore agree that without a hybrid cloud strategy, it's difficult to realize the full potential of a digital transformation.Hybrid cloud has become the dominant architecture (78% use one in Singapore), yet less than a quarter (25%) of respondents in Singapore manage their cloud environments holistically.In Singapore, difficulty managing complex environments (44%), regulatory compliance (38%), and security are the top barrier to integrating workloads across cloud environments.Regulatory and compliance roadblocks stand in the way of cloud goals in SingaporeRegulatory and compliance limitations are holding organizations in Singapore back from fully achieving their cloud goals.Over a quarter of respondents in Singapore cited regulatory compliance issues as a key barrier to integrating workloads across private and public IT environments (38%).Businesses in Singapore have the tools to secure their workloads in the cloud, but roadblocks indicate there remains a gap of some sort -- either in understanding, skills, trust, or technologyMore than half (57%) of respondents in Singapore agree/strongly agree that ""The Public Cloud is not secure enough for much of our data.""Security &amp; compliance is cited in Singapore as one of the top reasons (32%) for moving work off the cloud; Security concerns also present a roadblock (22%) in Singapore to achieving cloud business goals.High rates of adoption for all security tools in Singapore - Confidential computing, multifactor authentication, single sign-on, VPN, Virtual Desktop Interface, DevSecOps, Zero trust.Lack of skills and talent in Singapore is holding back cloud initiativesBusinesses in Singapore struggle to have the right talent to help them manage their cloud applications 77% of respondents in Singapore said their teams lack skills to be proficient.Lack of technical skills is among the top 3 challenges (34%) for businesses that want to integrate business partners into their cloud environments.Lack of talent or skills remains a roadblock for companies in Singapore - with more than a quarter (34%) of respondents saying it impedes them from their cloud objectives.Data privacy concerns are holding back enterprises in Singapore from unlocking the full potential of partnerships in the cloudData governance (55%) and cybersecurity (49%) are the top 2 challenges in Singapore to fully integrate their business ecosystem into the cloud.34% of respondents in Singapore cite a lack of technical skills as a hindrance to integrating ecosystem partners into the cloud.Methodology: This survey was conducted online in 12 countries (US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, India, Japan, China, Brazil, Spain, Singapore, Australia) by The Harris Poll on behalf of IBM from June 8th, 2022 to July 17th, 2022.

This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the NYSE Technology Index before fees and expenses.The NYSE Technology Index is composed of 35 leading U.S.-listed technology-related companies.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.35%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 0.77%.Story continuesSector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector - about 67.60% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Telecom round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) accounts for about 4.65% of the fund's total assets, followed by Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG).The top 10 holdings account for about 37.1% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has lost about -40.89% so far this year and is down about -37.03% in the last one year (as of 09/29/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $96.15 and $175.28.XNTK has a beta of 1.19 and standard deviation of 33.26% for the trailing three-year period. With about 36 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.AlternativesSPDR NYSE Technology ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Technology ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) tracks Technology Select Sector Index and the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) tracks MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index.

However, it remained under pressure from recessionary fears.On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures settled at $81.23 a barrel yesterday. Investors should know that oil slipped to a nine-month low of around $77 earlier in the week — the lowest since January.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Sep 23.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 215,000 barrels compared to expectations of a 300,000-barrel decrease per the analysts. The combination of a surge in exports, lower imports and a dip in domestic production accounted for the stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer even as refinery demand contracted.Total domestic stocks now stand at 430.6 million barrels — 2.9% more than the year-ago figure but 2% lower than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) rose 692,000 barrels to 25.7 million barrels.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover increased from 26.7 days in the previous week to 26.9 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 28.2 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies decreased for the second time in three weeks. The 2.4 million-barrel fall was primarily attributable to a surge in demand. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would rise 900,000 barrels. At 212.2 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 4.3% less than the year-earlier level and 6% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) dropped after rising for four weeks in a row. The 2.9 million-barrel fall reflected an uptick in demand and lower production. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply draw of some 100,000 barrels. Despite the recent decreases, current inventories — at 114.4 million barrels — are 11.8% below the year-ago level and 20% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at 90.6%, fell 3% from the prior week.Final WordWTI prices recently posted its longest run of weekly losses in 2022 following the Federal Reserve's decision to hike interest rates further in line with many other central banks across the world to step up the fight against soaring inflation. The tightening monetary policies have sparked concerns about a possible recession and, consequently, slowing crude demand. A stronger greenback, which can weaken dollar-denominated commodities like crude, also contributed to the downside.What stands out is that rates may not have peaked yet, and more toughness could be in store for the remainder of this year and 2023. This is because attempts are being made to cool the 40-year high inflation and prevent it from becoming entrenched.However, the U.S. benchmark has regained some ground in the wake of EIA’s bullish inventory report. Prices also drew support from the greenback’s climbdown from a 20-year high, which can strengthen dollar-denominated commodities like crude.As it is, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group (OPEC+) agreeing on a production curtailment, the Oil/Energy market has enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.As a matter of fact, the Energy Select Sector SPDR — an assortment of the largest U.S. companies thronging the space — has risen nearly 31% year to date against a 24% loss for the broader S&amp;P 500 benchmark.Consequently, three of the top five gainers of the S&amp;P 500 this year are all energy-related names: Occidental Petroleum OXY, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Hess Corporation HES.Occidental Petroleum: OXY is the top-performing S&amp;P 500 stock in 2022, with a gain of 114%.

COP is expected to see earnings growth of 142% in 2022. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s delve into the factors behind the stock’s price appreciation.What’s Favoring the Stock?The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price, currently trading higher than the $80-per-barrel mark, improved significantly in the past year. Strong oil prices are boons for ConocoPhillips’ operations as it holds a bulk of acres in the three big oil-rich unconventional plays — Eagle Ford shale, Delaware basin and Bakken shale.In the Eagle Ford shale, ConocoPhillips drilled more than 1,600 wells, which could provide access to huge oil-equivalent potential reserves. Moreover, in the Bakken shale, COP continues to develop and implement innovative methods and technologies to gain further improvements in developing 750 identified undrilled locations. The company’s production outlook seems bright as it has decades of low-cost premium drilling sites in those resources.For 2022, ConocoPhillips projects its production at 1.74 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBoe/d), suggesting an improvement from 1.6 MMBoe/d reported last year. For the third quarter, ConocoPhillips expects production of 1.70-1.76 MMBoe/d. Higher production will aid the company’s bottom line.ConocoPhillips has a sound balance sheet, with significantly lower debt exposure than the composite stocks belonging to the industry. Its debt-to-capitalization ratio of 0.25 is lower than the industry average of 0.33. Notably, the company generated cash from operating activities of $13 billion in the first half of 2022, which reflects strong operations.ConocoPhillips’ focus on returning capital to shareholders is commendable. COP revised higher its expected 2022 return of capital to shareholders. The new guidance is at $15 billion, reflecting an increase from the previously mentioned $10 billion. The incremental returns to stockholders will get distributed through share repurchases and VROC tiers. Notably, COP paid out $1.9 billion in ordinary dividends and VROC, and repurchased $3.7 billion of shares in the first half of this year.Story continuesRisksAlthough the long-term view seems lucrative, ConocoPhillips is exposed to oil price volatility that makes things challenging for the company. Also, increasing expenses are hurting the upstream energy player’s bottom line.Key PicksInvestors interested in the energy sector might look at the following companies that presently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

212,68853e60-0a03-3c46-a4d2-3497ad38c9be,AES,2022-09-30,5 Stocks With High ROE to Buy as Markets Regain Momentum,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-high-roe-buy-105610536.html,1664448970,STORY,"['AES', 'PEP', 'ACGLP', 'AESC', 'SUZ', 'DDS']","[The U.S. equity markets witnessed a sharp uptrend yesterday that partially reversed the decline of the past few trading sessions and five consecutive days of losses. The decline was triggered by the Fed’s third successive 75 basis point rate hike as it vowed to continue its aggressive stance to curb inflation. The Fed even indicated that it expects to bring the so-called terminal rate to 4.6% from the current range of 3-3.25%. The downslide was further compounded by the British pound hitting a three-decade low against the U.S. dollar as a slew of tax cuts per a new U.K. economic plan rattled the European markets.With the Bank of England indicating that it would temporarily purchase long-term U.K. government pounds to arrest the dwindling currency, the pound has stabilized. The U.S. Treasury yields also retreated from their peak to script a mini turnaround for the domestic stock market. However, investors would await further clarity regarding the future interest rate path and its likely impact on the economy as concerns about recession refuse to abate.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. The AES Corporation AES, PepsiCo, Inc. PEP, Dillard's, Inc. DDS, Suzano S.A. SUZ and Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Story continuesScreening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screen:AES Corporation: Arlington, VA-based AES Corporation, incorporated in 1981, is a global power company.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul said on Thursday the state plans to adopt the California requirements.In August, Toyota said it would boost its planned investment in a new U.S. battery plant from $1.29 billion to $3.8 billion, partly in response to rising consumer demand for electric vehicles. Toyota, the best selling auto brand in California, last month recognized the state's authority to set vehicle emissions standards under the U.S. Clean Air Act.Toyoda, the grandson of the company's founder, said in Wednesday's video that ""playing to win means playing with all the cards in the deck - not just a select few. So that’s our strategy and we’re sticking to it."" The previous day's video was played at Thursday's event.Toyoda compared the automaker to a ""department store"" selling a variety of vehicles to customers with different needs.Story continuesToyoda outlined challenges to EV adoption including impacts on the electrical grid and lack of easy access to electricity by about 1 billion people around the world.Toyota dealer Steve Gates, who has operations in Kentucky and Indiana, said the automaker's approach of selling a variety of vehicles makes sense. ""You can't make a living just selling EVs,"" Gates said.Toyota's corporate vision ""is to provide freedom of mobility for all ... and we don't want to leave anyone behind,"" Toyoda added.Last year, the Japanese automaker committed about $30 billion to develop battery electric vehicles. It expects the company's annual sales of such cars to reach only 3.5 million vehicles by the end of the decade, about one-third of current annual sales of its gasoline-powered cars.Toyota has won praise from the Biden administration for its EV investment plans after it clashed with the White House over a scrapped administration EV tax credit proposal that would have benefited unionized automakers.Earlier this month, President Joe Biden on a trip to Detroit briefly met with Tetsuo Ogawa, Toyota's top North America executive, officials told Reuters.Biden wants 50% of new vehicles by 2030 to be EVs or PHEVs, but he has not endorsed a firm date for ending gasoline-vehicle sales.Toyoda showed off his dance moves on Wednesday, telling dealers he celebrated after Toyota dethroned General Motors Co in 2021 as the best selling automaker in the United States, the first time GM did not hold the top spot since 1931.""I actually did a little 'happy dance' in my office,"" Toyoda said. ""Thankfully nobody saw it!"" (Reporting by David Shepardson in Las Vegas Editing by Leslie Adler and Matthew Lewis)]"

221,0fc2eb0c-e12a-3b8d-8343-527e2746831f,MKC,2022-09-30,Analysts Estimate McCormick (MKC) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-mccormick-mkc-report-140002386.html,1664460002,STORY,['MKC-V'],"[The market expects McCormick (MKC) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended August 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 6, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis spices and seasonings company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.65 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -18.8%.Revenues are expected to be $1.59 billion, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 13.08% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McCormick?For McCormick, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that McCormick will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that McCormick would post earnings of $0.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.48, delivering a surprise of -26.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.McCormick doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

After all, paydays are always the best.Investors are familiar with Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have successfully increased their dividend payout for 25 consecutive years.However, there is an even more exclusive group of dividend payers known as Dividend Kings.To achieve the attractive title of a Dividend King, a company must increase its dividend payout for a mind-boggling 50 consecutive years.Clearly, Dividend Kings know how to establish highly-successful operations.And they carry a commendable commitment to shareholders.Several companies have recently broken into the elite Dividend King club, including PPG Industries PPG, Target TGT, and Sysco SYY.Target and PPG Industries are two of the newest rookies in the club, having just made the cut.On the other hand, Sysco joined the group a few years ago.Below is a chart illustrating the share performance of all three companies year-to-date, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a deeper dive into each one.SyscoSysco markets and distributes a range of food and related products primarily to the food service or food-away-from-home industry.SYY’s annual dividend yield sits nicely at 2.7%, just below its Zacks Consumer Staples Sector average of 2.9%.In addition, the company carries a sizable 8.7% five-year annualized dividend growth rate paired with a payout ratio sitting at 60% of earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the company carries a favorable growth profile; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $4.20 for FY23 reflects a staggering 30% Y/Y uptick in earnings. And in FY24, the bottom line is projected to expand by an additional 13%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company also carries solid valuation levels, further bolstered by its Style Score of a B for Value.SYY shares trade at a 17.6X forward earnings multiple, well beneath the 21.7X five-year median and representing a slight 7% discount relative to its Zacks Consumer Staples Sector.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTargetTarget is a titan in the retail realm, with stores in all 50 states and DC. As of late, the company has evolved from just a pure brick-and-mortar retailer to an omnichannel entity.TGT’s annual dividend yield sits at a rock-solid 2.8%, notably above its Zacks Retail &amp; Wholesale Sector, paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 41% of earnings.Further, the company’s five-year annualized dividend growth rate comes in at a stellar 7.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRising costs have eaten into margins, with the company’s bottom-line forecasted to take a sizable 40% hit in FY23. Still, the picture kicks back into green in FY24, with estimates calling for 50% earnings growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTGT shares trade at a forward P/E of 19.2X, above its five-year median of 16.8X. However, the value is still nowhere near highs of 30.4X in 2020 and represents an attractive 19% discount relative to its Zacks Sector.Further, Target sports a Style Score of a B for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPPG IndustriesPPG Industries is a global supplier of paints, coatings, chemicals, specialty materials, glass, and fiberglass. PPG has manufacturing facilities and equity affiliates in roughly 70 countries.PPG’s annual dividend yield comes in at a respectable 2.2%, notably lower than its Zacks Basic Materials Sector.However, the company’s 6.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate is undoubtedly strong, and its 38% payout ratio is very sustainable.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPPG Industries’ bottom-line is projected to decrease a slight 2% in FY22, but the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $7.82 for FY23 suggests Y/Y earnings growth of a double-digit 17.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPPG shares trade notably above their Zacks Basic Materials Sector average, representing a 143% premium.However, it’s worth noting that PPG shares have historically traded at relatively elevated levels, and its 16.8X forward earnings multiple is well beneath its 18.7X five-year median and high of 27.4X in 2020.PPG sports a Style Score of a C for Value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineTargeting income-generating assets is a widely-deployed strategy, and for a very understandable reason – we love to get paid.Of course, some dividend payers are better than others, with higher yields.However, high yields can become unsustainable over time.Instead, targeting companies that have consistently upped their dividend payouts over the years is a much better way to receive an income stream that you know is reliable.Dividend Aristocrats are highly-respectable in their own right, but Dividend Kings take the throne.All three companies above – PPG Industries PPG, Target TGT, and Sysco SYY – are newer members of the elite club, displaying a stellar commitment to their shareholders throughout the years.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

229,6ae37859-df5b-3e1d-929f-ca2b2d302995,ISRG,2022-09-30,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 85% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuitive-surgical-inc-nasdaq-isrg-110016712.html,1664535616.0,STORY,"['ISRG', 'TROW']","[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 85% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Intuitive Surgical. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuitive Surgical?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Intuitive Surgical. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Intuitive Surgical's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Intuitive Surgical. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.1% of shares outstanding. With 7.4% and 7.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Intuitive SurgicalThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Intuitive Surgical, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$301m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 15% stake in Intuitive Surgical. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

The key is getting in line for that aid as soon as possible, some of which can be first-come, first served or from limited funds. Three-quarters (75%) of families, however, are unaware they can complete the FAFSA® beginning in October and only a little over half (54%) were aware all families can file a FAFSA®, potentially missing out on opportunities to make college more affordable.Sallie Mae© offers the following FAFSA® tips and also offers a free step-by-step guide through Nitro College to help families complete the all-important form with confidence:Complete the FAFSA® on October 1 (or soon after) —The FAFSA® is the gateway to more than $112 billion in scholarships, grants, state-aid, and federal financial aid and schools use the information provided to create financial aid packages. The sooner families complete the FAFSA®, the better the chance to receive aid that may be first-come, first-serve or from programs with limited funds.Never paying to fill out the FAFSA® – Filing is free, period. There are also a variety of free resources to help families fill out the FAFSA® properly.Do your homework before you file — Both students and parents should gather Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, bank statements, 2021 tax returns, and W-2 forms, and create an FSA ID. Having this information ready before you begin the application can help expedite the process.Don’t assume you won’t qualify for aid – Nearly four in 10 families (36%) said they bypassed the FAFSA® because they believed their income was too high to be eligible. The reality is, just about every family will qualify for some form of aid.Remember to file each year — FAFSA® applications should be completed every year in school. Be sure to save and file your FSA credentials and set a reminder for when it’s time to file again.Check deadlines – Many states and colleges set priority deadlines to submit the FAFSA® to be considered for aid. You can check deadlines for each school here.Story continues""While seven in 10 families reported completing the FAFSA last year, too often those who do not complete are first-generation college students and students from underserved communities who are most likely to be eligible for grants and other aid,"" said Rick Castellano vice president, Sallie Mae. ""We need to continue to raise awareness and offer resources to help these students and families complete the FAFSA. It's critical we also look for ways to further simplify and streamline the process so families can make more informed and confident decisions about paying for higher education.""For more information on completing the FAFSA® visit www.salliemae.com/FAFSA and Nitro College.Sallie Mae (Nasdaq: SLM) believes education and life-long learning, in all forms, help people achieve great things.

The call came after reports surfaced earlier in the week that the tech giant would slow iPhone production amid softer-than-expected demand.""We expect material negative estimate revisions driven by weaker consumer demand (Services already in slowdown and we expect products to follow),"" Mohan warned.That downgrade prompted Mohan's colleague at BofA Vivek Arya to highlight the potential risk to shares of Apple's suppliers.Customers shop at an Apple Store on the first day of sale for the Apple iPhone 14 in Beijing, China, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)""We assess the potential impact of Apple unit cuts on semis vendors by analyzing historical Apple exposure to determine average selling prices per iPhone,"" Arya wrote. ""We then reduce consensus iPhone unit estimates by a similar magnitude applied by our BofA IT Hardware team. Our analysis assumes cuts are incremental, though it is possible consensus already includes some weakness in outlook (and note potential for incremental upside from second half content opportunities).""According to Arya, here are the top names in the Apple supplier ecosystem and their exposures to any Apple demand slowdown:High risk (3% to 5% sales downside): Cirrus Logic (CRUS), with an 80% Apple exposure, Skyworks (SWKS), with a 55%-60% exposure, and Qorvo (QRVO), with a 30%-35% exposure.Moderate risk (1% to 2% sales downside): large-cap vendors Qualcomm (QCOM) and Broadcom (AVGO), each with about 20%-25% Apple sales exposure, and iPhone sensor suppliers Coherent (COHR) and Lumentum (LITE), with 5% and 15% sales exposure, respectively.Low risk (less than 1% sales downside): Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI), and NXP Semiconductors (NXP), each with less than 10% Apple exposure.Apple stock is off by more than 7% so far this week, worse than the 2% drop for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Year to date, Apple's stock is down by 20%.Story continuesFurthermore, the impact of a smartphone slowdown may not just be limited to Apple's products, Arya contended. That, in turn, could lead to a broader pullback for producers.""Despite modest Apple cuts, China/Android handset weakness is having a more pronounced impact on the overall smartphone market,"" Arya explained. ""In July, China mobile phone sell-in declined roughly 30% on a MoM/YoY basis, catalyzing BofA Global Tech team to lower CY22/23 smartphone unit declines to -12%/-3% YoY (vs. -10%/+1% prior). ... While Android impacts are broadly known (we highlight QRVO SepQ/DecQ guide on its FQ1 call, representing near $350 million miss), visibility remains limited, and length of corrections remains questionable, creating sustained downside risk.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

The major stock indexes, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500, have fallen 18.3%, 29.4% and 22%, respectively, year to date (YTD).The equity market has been hammered by recession fears, inflationary pressure and soaring interest rates. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has further increased worries for investors about the global economic recovery.Technology is among the most-battered sectors amid a broader market sell-off this year so far. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, which seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the Technology Select Sector Index, has lost approximately 28% of its value YTD.Tech companies are witnessing lower demand for their products and solutions as organizations are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. In July 2022, Gartner lowered its forecast for worldwide IT spending growth rate to 3% from 4% mentioned earlier. The research firm’s report highlights that 2022 IT spending growth will be much slower than 2021 due to spending cutbacks across devices, software, IT services and communication services areas.Additionally, the sector is suffering from inflationary pressure, higher wages and currency fluctuations. Supply-chain disruptions due to an acute shortage of chips and several other components are affecting the profitability of the companies in the space.The aforementioned challenges are likely to persist in the near term, thereby negatively impacting the overall financial performances of the majority of tech stocks.

""This shines a light (on the fact) that assets managers and investment funds are prepared for a new arrival of agribusiness companies (to the stock market),"" he said.Brazil's booming farm sector accounts for around 25% of the national GDP, considering the industries and services, Colpo noted.For that reason, it is important that investors are educated about the sector, where the typical seasonality of crops often affects companies' results, he said.Fabio Nazari, a partner at investment bank BTG Pactual, who moderated the panel Colpo took part in, also showed confidence in a new wave of agribusiness IPOs.""The agribusiness sector is underrepresented on the Brazilian stock exchange, based on what it means for Brazil and the countries in the world,"" Nazari said.BTG's credit exposure to Brazilian agribusiness companies is almost 20 billion reais ($3.70 billion), or around 20% of its loan portfolio, bank CEO Roberto Sallouti said.In two years, BTG led share offerings for almost 11 billion reais, he said.

(NASDAQ:MAR)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-marriott-international-121616754.html,1664453776,STORY,['MAR'],"[Let's talk about the popular Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$166 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$133. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Marriott International's current trading price of US$144 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Marriott International’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Marriott International What's The Opportunity In Marriott International?Marriott International appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 26.78x is currently well-above the industry average of 17.08x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Marriott International’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Marriott International generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 68% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Marriott International. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? MAR’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe MAR should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on MAR for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for MAR, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Marriott International at this point in time.

While consumer confidence is still less than prepandemic levels, the improving mood may provide a lift to retail ETFs that have taken a beating this year. Two examples are the $254 million SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF (XRT) and the $198 million Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY).These funds’ losses stand out even in the current market, where hardly anything is in positive territory. While the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which tracks the entire stock market, is down nearly 24% year to date, XRT and IBUY are down 35.6% and 54.9%, respectively. The funds share 14 holdings, largely because XRT focuses on a broader retail space. Stocks held by XRT represent more than a quarter of IBUY’s portfolio. Pandemic Fueled Online RetailThe pandemic drove IBUY’s rise. Online retail jumped to a peak of 16.4% of all retail sales in the second quarter of 2020, about six months into the pandemic, according to Commerce Department figures. That’s up from 11.9% for the first quarter of 2020, which was a new high. Despite the waning pandemic, e-commerce is still grabbing almost 15% of retail sales. With green signals flashing, why are IBUY and XRT languishing? Inflation may be the answer. As prices have risen this year, Americans are saving less. While staples are fairly steady in terms of demand, discretionary purchases are likely taking a hit. That may explain why IBUY is even deeper in the red than XRT.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for KLA What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.35bUS$3.50bUS$3.42bUS$3.39bUS$3.39bUS$3.41bUS$3.44bUS$3.49bUS$3.54bUS$3.59bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ -0.86%Est @ -0.02%Est @ 0.57%Est @ 0.98%Est @ 1.27%Est @ 1.47%Est @ 1.61% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4% US$3.1kUS$3.0kUS$2.8kUS$2.6kUS$2.4kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$24bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.9%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.6b× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (7.4%– 1.9%) = US$68bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$68b÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$33bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$57b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$316, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 22% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at KLA as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.277. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Suppliers were asked to report to eight sections related to social and labor impacts, including Recruitment &amp; Hiring, Working Hours, Wages &amp; Benefits, Employee Treatment, Employee Involvement, Health &amp; Safety, Termination &amp; Retrenchment and overall Management. 59%1 of the suppliers we requested to complete the Higg FSLM had their responses verified, which allows us further insight into the social and labor practices within our partner factories.Tapestry, Inc., Thursday, September 29, 2022, Press release pictureWORKER EMPOWERMENT IN OUR SUPPLY CHAINTapestry's 2025 Our Social Fabric goals included a commitment to provide 50,000 people working in the factories crafting our products access to empowerment programs by 2025. In July 2021, Tapestry doubled this goal to reach 100,000 people working in the factories that craft our products.To help us reach this goal, we partnered with BSR's HERproject, a collaborative initiative that looks to empower low-income women in global supply chains through workplace-based programs. Herproject brings together global brands, factories and local NGOs to support programs on health, financial inclusion and gender equality. The initiative uses a datadriven approach to help understand and analyze the impact of its programs, including through baseline and end-line assessment surveys. Its forward-looking model uses a ""peer-to-peer methodology"" and by doing so, creates a platform for longevity.We initially launched this partnership in May 2021 at two of our supplier facilities in Vietnam, reaching 12,500 workers.

It's an important issue,"" Hoyer said, adding that he wanted to ensure that ""if and when we do something we do it right.""The bill would impose the restrictions on not just members of Congress, but also congressional staff, U.S. Supreme Court justices and other senior officials.The goal is to tamp down potential conflicts of interest in Washington.Currently, lawmakers can engage in trading but are not allowed to use non-public information in making investment decisions.

We're seeing major averages lower across the board for the Dow, the S&amp;P 500, and the NASDAQ.We've got some fresh commentary out from St. Louis, the Fed president, James Bullard, speaking during a virtual forum, saying that markets understood the message from the Fed's latest dot plot, and that shows the Fed expects more tightening this year. For more, let's get to Jared Blikre, who is in studio with us. Jared, what are we seeing so far--JARED BLIKRE: Well--BRAD SMITH: --in today's data?JARED BLIKRE: --the Fed really means it, right, as we've been talking about here. All right, so another down day. And this precedes-- or this follows an up day in the markets that we saw Monday. Turned around Tuesday, turning around to the downside. Here is a two-day action in the NASDAQ. You can see we have now given it all back, plus a little bit. We are in the negative by about just a little bit, 12 basis points for the week.As we were looking at the price action yesterday, a lot of it was facilitated by that big move by the Bank of England, kind of reversing policy. Going to buy bonds for a few weeks to support their markets and potentially their pension systems there. This is the S&amp;P 500 over the last three months. Here's that big August rally that we have. It gave that back and more as well.So could we be due for a bounce here? Very-- a lot of signs, a lot of signs that we could be. But I don't think this is the low just yet. I think Wall Street is kind of in agreement on that. So we'll have to see how all of this evolves. And everybody here knows I'm a big fan of the ICE B of A MOVE Index. This tracks the volatility of the bond market. We've been seeing a lot of bond market volatility recently. And this is a new postpandemic high.Story continuesAnd in fact, if we put five-year chart, actually, so this is almost tying the levels that we saw in the very depths at the very beginning of that pandemic selloff in 2020. Want to get a quick check of the US dollar because the weakness that we were seeing yesterday facilitated that big risk rally. And so that was a consequence of what was happening over there in the Bank of England.You can see we are still within the range yesterday-- not a big movement, so hard to say. If we temporarily have a top in the dollar, which it's very overbought right now, we could have a reversal, which means to the upside, in risk markets. But we'll have to see if anything comes of that.Here's the NASDAQ 100 today. Apple down 3%, Tesla down 3%. Some weakness in the chip stocks. I'm going to go to that board right now, where we can see Nvidia and ASML, Taiwan Semi, AMD, all down more than 3%. So just kind of adding to those substantial losses that we've seen for the month of September and closing the quarter as well, guys.BRIAN SOZZI: Jared Blikre, thanks so much.]"

After the release, the Elite Soft Tissue Biopsy System became the latest addition to the company’s comprehensive portfolio of biopsy devices, including the TEMNO, Achieve and Tru-Cut family of devices.The latest launch is expected to solidify Merit Medical’s foothold in the global soft tissue biopsy space. The single-use TEMNO Elite Soft Tissue Biopsy device is indicated for use in various soft tissue locations—such as liver, lung, lymph nodes, kidney, and other soft tissue suspect lesions.Shares of Merit Medical have lost 7.6% this year compared with the industry’s decline of 21.2%.

During a biopsy, tissues from patients are extracted and examined. Accurate diagnosis of a disease requires adequate sample size and quality of tissues. Merit Medical’s new biopsy system is stated to have obtained samples that are 72% larger than its competitor’s side-notch, semi-automatic devices.The new biopsy device also includes a Sample Assist feature, simplifying tissue removal for clinicians with an easy button slide. The system includes a valved coaxial introducer that helps reduce procedural steps and blood leakage and helps to reduce the risk of pneumothorax and air embolism in patients.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global biopsy devices market was valued at $2.73 billion in 2018. The market size is expected to increase to $4.31 billion in 2026 at a compound annual growth rate of 5.9%.

H, McKesson Corp. MCK and Carlsberg A/S CABGY.3 Stocks with Upgraded Broker Ratings for Impressive ReturnsAmid the continued market turmoil on serious macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, it is becoming increasingly difficult for investors to select stocks independently and generate solid returns. One way to choose the right stocks is to follow rating upgrades by brokers.In this regard, stocks like Hyatt Hotels Corp., McKesson Corp. and Carlsberg A/S are worth considering.As brokers directly communicate with the top management, they have a deeper insight into what is happening in a particular company. They diligently review companies' publicly available documents and even attend conference calls.Brokers have a more understanding of the overall sector and industry. They place company fundamentals against the current economic backdrop to determine how a particular stock will fare as an investment.So, when brokers upgrade a stock, you can rely on their judgment. But solely depending on broker upgrades is not a good way to build your investment portfolio. Several other factors should be taken into consideration to ensure steady returns.Here are the three stocks that qualified for the screening:Hyatt Hotels, based in Chicago, IL, is a leading global hospitality company.

264,3c2ac4ce-ee31-3c46-b869-75b8efb2bde4,GPC,2022-09-30,Genuine Parts' (NYSE:GPC) investors will be pleased with their favorable 77% return over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/genuine-parts-nyse-gpc-investors-150737489.html,1664464057,STORY,['GPC'],"[One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, the Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC) share price is up 62% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 27% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 26% in the last year , including dividends .Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Genuine Parts While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Genuine Parts was able to grow its EPS at 14% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. We note that the 17% yearly (average) share price gain isn't too far from the EPS growth rate. Coincidence? Probably not. This suggests that sentiment and expectations have not changed drastically. Au contraire, the share price change has arguably mimicked the EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Genuine Parts' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Genuine Parts the TSR over the last 3 years was 77%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Genuine Parts shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 26% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 13% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

CMEP was one of six entities honored at the event, joining other businesses, a school system, and public-private partnerships receiving awards this year.Arriaga's and Khandelwal's research found most parts for the company's 6.7 liter diesel engine were either already made of corrosive-resistant materials or had some kind of treatment prior to assembly. The benefit of the clear coating was largely degraded by the time the Cummins engine was installed at the customer's facility and then left that facility for the next stop on its journey.Eliminating the coating operation not only significantly reduced VOC emissions, but also cut the water, soap and chemicals used to clean the engines, as well as the energy used to dry engines after they were painted.Reducing VOC emissions is one of the 2030 goals included in PLANET 2050, Cummins' environmental sustainability strategy. The strategy establishes the goal of reducing VOCs from paint and coating operations across the company by 50% over the next decade in addition to goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), water use and waste production. Other goals include creating a lifecycle plan for every part and recycling 100% of packaging plastics.Story continuesThe two engineers, as well as Plant Manager Nicole Wheeldon, all emphasize the benefits of eliminating the clear coating extend beyond the environment. There is a cost-savings with no longer painting the engines for both the company and the customer. The change also frees up valuable space in the plant for other uses and allows the employees in the painting operation to be re-assigned to other more important tasks.The change, which went into effect in the fourth quarter of 2021, also eliminated something of a bottleneck in the plant when engines had to be cleaned, painted and dried.Little changes, however, when end users open up the hood. They will continue to see a small vanity plate with the Cummins logo on top of the company's powerful 6.7-liter engine.Cummins Inc., Thursday, September 29, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: http://cummins.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cummins Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/718124/Cummins-Plant-Wins-State-Honor-for-Environmental-Excellence]"

The company targets 50-60 million global subscribers by 2025.Starz originals in 2022, like the sixth season of Outlander, released in May, the second season of P-Valley, released in June, and The Serpent Queen, released in September have gained a lot of traction from viewers.The company has significantly ramped up its spending on premium content for Starz in fiscal 2023.

The revenues for the quarter were $381.2 million compared with $382.3 million of the previous year. It also booked a loss of $37 million in the quarter against the previous-year quarter’s profit of $88.2 million.The profitability has been hurt due to the rising cost of production, and increasing investments in content, marketing and partnerships.

The ComEd EV Toolkit provides information on savings, benefits and incentives for the purchase of EVs, along with an overview of EV brands and models, rate options, EV chargers and a public charging station locator. The EV Toolkit empowers customers by providing the latest information and resources to help those considering an EV more easily make the transition.""As part of our commitment to creating a cleaner and brighter future for every community in northern Illinois, ComEd is working to help customers transition to clean transportation technologies that will help lower emissions and bring cleaner air into our communities,"" said Melissa Washington, Chief Customer Officer at ComEd. ""Whether you are considering an EV or are already an EV driver, ComEd’s EV Toolkit provides everything you need to know – from available financial incentives to personalized fuel cost savings estimates – to help determine which make and model is right for you.""Illinois is poised to scale EV adoption considerably in the years ahead, thanks to the passage of state and federal climate action. The new Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) law, passed last year, makes Illinois the first state in the Midwest to set a goal of achieving 100 percent clean energy by 2050. CEJA also sets a goal of adding 1 million EVs to Illinois roads by 2030.To help customers plan as demand for EVs grows, ComEd’s EV Toolkit offers a variety of interactive features for those considering EVs as well as those who have already bought an EV. Customers can use the EV Toolkit to:Calculate Cost Savings – get a real-time look at your potential savings from switching from a gas vehicle to an EV by plugging in data on your miles driven, current gas prices and more.Review Vehicles and Chargers - peruse a list of EV vehicle brands and models currently available for purchase, and if you have the option to install in-home charging, choose a charger that meets your needs.Search Incentives – review a list of available state rebates and federal tax credits, and how to qualify for incentives before you buy.New EV Owner – find out about available service rate options to maximize savings based on the time you charge and register your EV with ComEd to help ensure your home is EV ready.Public Charging Locator – search a map of over 500 public charging stations in the area, and where to charge for free, according to your zip code.Story continuesFor those considering an EV, the benefits of new zero-emissions cars provide a range of consumer savings and benefits. This includes significant savings, due to the efficiency of EV engines and their 100 percent use of electricity replacing the high cost of gasoline. EVs also are known to save customers over an equivalent gasoline-powered car, with an estimated $2,281-$2,481 in savings on fuel costs per year for someone driving 15,000 miles annually over an equivalent gasoline-powered car, based on current market and fuel costs in Illinois. The savings to the customer are even higher, when considering avoided operations and maintenance costs over the lifetime of the vehicle.""As the widespread availability of EVs grows, charging infrastructure matures and government incentives make EVs more affordable, mass consumer education is critical now more than ever before,"" said Jennifer Morand, Co-President, Chicago Automobile Trade Association. ""The EV customers of yesterday can’t be compared to today’s EV buyer, which is why resources like ComEd’s EV Toolkit are pivotal for this next phase of EV adoption.""In addition to saving at the pump, customers can look forward to broad environmental improvements generated by the transition to EVs. The American Lung Association estimates that conversion to EVs in Illinois could save a cumulative $3.2 billion by 2050.""Electric vehicles help to reduce air pollution, which improves local air quality and leads to fewer people with lung disease,"" said John Walton, chair, Chicago Area Clean Cities. ""With a wide range of new rebates and options on the market, the ComEd EV Toolkit is designed to meet consumers where they are and to help them make informed decisions around EV purchase, installation, and ownership that will help move us closer toward our collective goal of reducing carbon pollution across our communities.""Electrifying transportation – including cars and public transit – can create tangible health benefits for all communities and families across northern Illinois, even those who do not choose to use electric transportation options.In fact, EVs can reduce air pollutants in the areas that would benefit most: diverse and low-income communities. For example, the City of Chicago’s Air Quality and Health Index reports the areas with the worst air quality and health indices are also neighborhoods where people of color make up a higher share of the population, and moreover, these communities are more likely to live close to industrial facilities and busy transit routes, where air pollutant emissions are higher.Beyond the EV Toolkit, ComEd is committed to helping customers navigate new technology options, and to promote EV adoption broadly throughout the region. Just last month, ComEd announced its Beneficial Electrification (BE) plan, which, pending approval by the Illinois Commerce Commission, would provide $300 million over the next three years to help communities promote equitable access to EVs, lower costs of EV adoption for customers and communities, and accelerate the buildout of a large network of EV charging infrastructure serving the region.The BE plan is designed to expand adoption by providing direct support to residential, business, school district and governmental partners. While the EV Toolkit is designed for residential customers, ComEd has also recently launched programs geared toward its other customer classes. This includes the EV Readiness program, a collaboration with the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus (MMC), aimed at providing cities and towns support with creating local policy and programs to ensure a safe and efficient implementation of new EVs and related infrastructure. This program is funded by a $225,000 commitment from ComEd and is expected to launch its first cohort in the fall.Additionally, ComEd has begun piloting fleet assessment for large customers, and currently encourages businesses who are considering large-scale EV integration to contact us at EVBusiness@comed.comFor more information on EVs and to access the toolkit, visit www.comed.com/EVCommonwealth Edison Company (ComEd) is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), the nation’s leading competitive energy provider, with approximately 10 million customers.

N.A. sales beat, but on heavily-compressed margins, with ongoing declines ahead; which begs the question, Why force revenues if they drive earnings before interest, taxes [EBIT] declines? Sell less, Charge more, Make more. And importantly, although direct-to-consumer [DTC] grew, both gross margin and EBIT rates (and dollars) declined (again), furthering our fears of misplaced DTC expectations. Although we still see its scale as long-term competitive advantage, for today, Nike looks increasingly like other over-inventoried promo-chasing retailers.""Jefferies Managing Director Randal KonikRating: Buy (reiterated)Price Target: $115 (down from $130)Story continues""While some near-term pain ahead, long-term remains attractive.

Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Shell (SHEL) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $3.31 a share 28 days away from its upcoming earnings release on October 27, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $3.31 Most Accurate Estimate and the $3.03 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Shell has an Earnings ESP of 9.36%.SHEL is just one of a large group of Oils-Energy stocks with a positive ESP figure.

Furthermore, there is a push to expand SINET into Society 5.0 and elementary, junior high and high school settings, making it a critical pillar in Japan's $4.4 billion GIGA School Program, which aims to prepare students for the country's push toward a post-information society.Building on a relationship that spans over a decade, NII engaged Juniper for SINET6 with the goal of improving its services by implementing advanced technologies such as 400G optical transmission, 5G mobile and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV). To scale SINET6’s reach and performance to 400G, NII selected Juniper’s MX Series Universal Routing Platforms and ACX Series Cloud Metro Routers for router network.Story continuesSINET6's supported POPs have now seen a 1.5x increase to 70 sites, improving connectivity experiences for the country's research institutions. SINET6 also utilizes Juniper’s PseudoWire Headend Termination (PWHT) capability provided by Junos OS, directly connecting sites using the ACX Cloud Metro Routers, lowering connectivity costs and simplifying the network. To safeguard against cyberattacks, the Juniper and Corero Joint DDoS Protection Solution was integrated with the MX Routing Platforms to enable high-speed, low-load and accurate attack traffic detection and defense.With networking upgrades from Juniper, NII officially launched SINET6 in April 2022, and it is now being considered for use in a broader range of research and education applications than ever before, with plans to evolve even further as a network service. Looking ahead, efforts to streamline and automate the network are planned for the upcoming SINET7 in order to meet the diverse needs of the growing number of subscribers.Supporting Quotes:""We are delighted to have Juniper Networks join us on this journey to create the latest and most advanced iteration of SINET. Juniper’s solutions are enough considered the requests of SINET6, providing with one of the most advanced networks that can support game-changing research and seamless digital learning experiences. With Juniper, we are confident that we have a strong foundation to meet the current and future needs of Japan’s research and education institutions for years to come.""- Takashi Kurimoto, Associate Professor, Information Systems Architecture Science Research Division, National Institute of Informatics""It is an honor to once again be chosen by NII to provide our experience-first solutions to power SINET6, which supports cutting-edge research and education in Japan.

This compares to earnings of $0.28 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 71.43%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this communications company would post a loss of $0.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.06, delivering a surprise of 300%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Comtech , which belongs to the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, posted revenues of $126.98 million for the quarter ended July 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.55%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $145.81 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Comtech shares have lost about 56.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -22%.What's Next for Comtech?While Comtech has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Comtech: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.23 on $111.03 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.34 on $489.15 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Wireless Equipment is currently in the bottom 23% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Juniper Networks (JNPR), has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on October 25.This computer network equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.50 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.7%.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Comcast's shares before the 4th of October to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 26th of October.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.27 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.08 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Comcast has a trailing yield of approximately 3.5% on its current stock price of $31.16. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Comcast's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Fortunately Comcast's payout ratio is modest, at just 34% of profit. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Comcast generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It distributed 32% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. For this reason, we're glad to see Comcast's earnings per share have risen 12% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly and the company is retaining a majority of its earnings within the business. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Comcast has increased its dividend at approximately 17% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Comcast? We love that Comcast is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about Comcast, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Comcast is facing.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 2.1%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Oracle Oracle's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Oracle's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 155.2% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 26% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendOracle Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2012, the dividend has gone from $0.24 total annually to $1.28. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 18% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Unfortunately, Oracle's earnings per share has been essentially flat over the past five years, which means the dividend may not be increased each year.Our Thoughts On Oracle's DividendOverall, we think Oracle is a solid choice as a dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't raised this year. While the payments look sustainable for now, earnings have been shrinking so the dividend could come under pressure in the future. Taking all of this into consideration, the dividend looks viable moving forward, but investors should be mindful that the company has pushed the boundaries of sustainability in the past and may do so again.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

SUBARU was able to improve its development cycle, gain significant efficiencies and reduce operational costs by reducing computational timeframes by approximately 20 percent with High Performance Computing (HPC) on OCI.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)With a focus on improving drivers' ""Enjoyment and Peace of Mind,"" SUBARU is implementing improvements to enhance design and development efficiency, agility, and flexibility. To achieve this, SUBARU recognized it needed to increase the resources supporting its computationally intensive HPC workloads that perform vast and complex simulations to improve its vehicles' collision safety and performance. Aware of how cloud technology is being used in the automotive industry to provide HPC resources to support computer aided engineering (CAE) simulations, SUBARU selected OCI to move its large HPC workloads of up to tens of thousands of cores to OCI from an on-premises environment.""Our goal has always been to be a trusted partner for our customers and to provide attractive and distinctive products that bring enjoyment and peace of mind. We rely on technology to help us continuously improve and innovate so that we can offer the best experience to our customers.  Being able to quickly conduct the vast number of simulations needed to improve crash safety and driving performance is a key focus for us. We selected OCI HPC to improve the speed of computations of collision simulations and to optimize costs. OCI gives us access to the cloud tools we need so we can automate and run jobs seamlessly, enabling faster design and development,"" said Mr. Yoshihiro Takekuma, IT Operation and Management Section, Engineering Information Management Department, SUBARU Corporation.Story continuesUsing OCI bare metal HPC computing, coupled with fast cluster networking, which delivers less than 2 microseconds of latency and 100 Gbps of bandwidth, SUBARU now has the computing resources it needs to scale rapidly to meet demand peaks. Previously, system expansion within its on-premises environments was often restricted by lack of space, power, cost, and IT resources. Since using OCI to deliver consistent high performance and greater stability for its computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, SUBARU has been able to make improvements to the internal acoustics of its vehicles to deliver a quieter drive. It has also enabled SUBARU to eliminate any variation in computation of collision analysis, by providing ideal conditions to perform structural calculations.OCI also supports various third-party solutions through Oracle Cloud Marketplace to help customers quickly find applications and services that can help them optimize their cloud deployments, including from Altair®, a global leader in computational science and artificial intelligence (AI). SUBARU has further reduced costs by using the cloud bursting function of Altair® PBS Professional® in combination with OCI to start the nodes required for calculation and delete the nodes when the calculation is completed, bringing flexibility to the allocation of resources.""In automotive engineering, having access to powerful and affordable HPC, is essential to run the computationally intensive and highly latency sensitive simulations and calculations needed to deliver the best outcomes when it comes to car safety and the driving experience. By providing high performance and elasticity at lower cost, OCI HPC is ideal for companies like SUBARU that require large simulation environments. We look forward to OCI fueling further technological innovations for SUBARU and contributing to their improved competitiveness,"" said Karan Batta, vice president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.ARGO GRAPHICS Inc., one of SUBARU's long-term IT partners, supported the migration of SUBARU's HPC workloads to OCI, which started operations in May 2022.SUBARU also leveraged Oracle Cloud Lift Services as part of its initial verification process to support its proof of concept to help issues relating to cloud migration with its production machine testing environment.

The experience recreates the iconic series setting of Maretime Bay, a seaside town destination where everyone is welcome, and self-expression runs free. In a first of its kind twist, upon entering the game, players' Roblox avatars will undergo a magical transformation into a customizable pony avatar—a feature unique to the ""Visit Maretime Bay'' experience that enables fans to go beyond the screen and fully immerse themselves in this world of friendship, fun and adventure.My Little Pony makes its mark on the metaverse with new game, “Visit Maretime Bay,” in celebration of new episodes of My Little Pony: Make Your Mark, now on Netflix.""When we started to imagine how My Little Pony would show up in the metaverse, it was really important for us to stay true to our core values of friendship, self-expression, and celebrating each other's uniqueness,"" said Jessica Murphy, SVP Entertainment Brand Marketing, Entertainment One. ""We're pushing what's possible on Roblox through a novel experience that allows kids and their parents to transform their typical avatar into a Pony, allowing them to become part of the story as they interact with our characters. And, we're focused on ensuring that our fans enjoy Maretime Bay in a free, safe environment.""Hasbro's diligence in developing a secure experience for kids includes elimination of both the chat feature as well as any monetization through Robux (Roblox's premium currency).

By playing a series of minigames and exploring Maretime Bay, players can earn badges inspired by the ponies' cutie marks, which draw upon the unique personality traits of the show's beloved characters. Plus, players can ""earn their wings"" and other limited edition accessories for their Roblox avatar's inventory such as the ""Sparky the Dragon"" shoulder pet, allowing them to continue their self-expression outside of the ""Visit Maretime Bay"" game.Story continuesThe Roblox activation is part of My Little Pony's integrated ""Visit Maretime Bay'' campaign, developed in partnership with Media.Monks, which positions the fictitious show location as the hottest new vacation spot that families can visit without leaving home. The campaign also includes a partnership with Tripadvisor, and marks the first time the travel company has partnered with a kids entertainment brand. While browsing the Tripadvisor platform, Maretime Bay is listed as an actual family vacation destination with attractions one can experience by watching the series on Netflix. Plus, parents can look out for ""Visit Maretime Bay"" creative ads for the My Little Pony: Make Your Mark series in their social feeds via TripAdvisor and My Little Pony handles.Coinciding with the ""Visit Maretime Bay'' campaign, Hasbro is furthering My Little Pony's brand promise of friendship and self-expression by supporting organizations that bolster the confidence of young girls. A partnership with Girl Scouts of the USA, now in its second year, will feature a fun patch that Daisy and Brownie troops across the country can earn when they complete Girl Scout and My Little Pony challenges. My Little Pony will also celebrate girls everywhere by sponsoring Rebel Girls' upcoming Rebel Girls Fest: Be the Change at bookstore events across the US and Canada in October.Following an incredible brand transformation that spans multi-platform animated content, including nearly 500 minutes of original animation dropping in 2022 alone, new music, the first ever official My Little Pony podcast, toys, apparel, accessories, cross-category products and more, My Little Pony is leveraging new technology, adapting to meet their audience everywhere they are, and encouraging self-expression amongst a new generation of fans.ABOUT MY LITTLE PONYSince launching in 1983, MY LITTLE PONY has catapulted from an iconic toy into a worldwide entertainment universe with multiple verticals including toys, games, licensed consumer products, publishing, music, a thriving YouTube channel, digital gaming, live experiences and much more.

The transaction is now expected to close in early October, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions.The merger will result in the addition of high-quality properties to the Prologis' portfolio in major regions across the nation, including Southern California, New Jersey, South Florida, Chicago, Dallas and Atlanta.On materialization of the merger, Duke Realty shareholders will be receiving 0.475 of a newly issued share of Prologis common stock for each Duke Realty share they own just prior to the effective time of the merger.According to the Prologis’ press release on the merger in June, the portfolio to be acquired will consist of operating properties in 19 major U.S. logistics regions, encompassing 153 square feet. It will also include 11 million square feet of development projects underway with a total expected investment of around $1.6 billion and 1,228 acres of land owned and under option with a build-out of roughly 21 million square feet. PLD intends to retain roughly 94% of Duke Realty’s assets and exit one market.Moreover, that time, the transaction was expected to result in immediate accretion of roughly $310-$370 million from corporate general and administrative cost savings and operating leverage as well as mark-to-market adjustments on leases and debt. In year one, the company’s annual core funds from operations (FFO) per share is anticipated to rise 20 cents to 25 cents, excluding promotes. Future synergies have the potential to generate roughly $375-$400 million in annual earnings and value creation.  With healthy operating fundamentals in the industrial real estate markets, Prologis has capitalized on growth opportunities through acquisitions and developments. In February 2020, the company accomplished the $13-billion acquisition of Liberty Property Trust, strengthening its presence in target regions, such as Chicago, Lehigh Valley, New Jersey, Houston, Central PA and Southern California.In the second quarter of 2022, Prologis’ share of building acquisitions amounted to $846 million, with a weighted average stabilized cap rate of 3.9% in the reported quarter. Development stabilization aggregated $817 million, while development starts totaled $1.67 billion, with 25.6% being build-to-suit. For 2022, the company anticipates building acquisitions at Prologis share between $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion, while development starts are expected in the range of $4.5-$5.0 billion.As for Prologis, with enhanced scale and top-quality assets in most-sought-after markets, the company is well poised to capture the benefits of favorable industrial market conditions.The demand for industrial real estate space is soaring given an e-commerce boom, the growth in industries and companies striving to improve supply-chain efficiencies.Additionally, a rise in inventory levels of companies as a precautionary measure for any supply-chain disruption is expected to lend to the long-term growth momentum for this sector, thereby serving a favorable market to industrial landlords.Prologis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$83.61 and falling to the lows of US$55.39. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Seagate Technology Holdings' current trading price of US$56.98 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Seagate Technology Holdings’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings Is Seagate Technology Holdings Still Cheap?Good news, investors! Seagate Technology Holdings is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 7.19x is currently well-below the industry average of 14.59x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. What’s more interesting is that, Seagate Technology Holdings’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Seagate Technology Holdings generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Seagate Technology Holdings, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -9.1%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although STX is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, the negative profit outlook does bring on some uncertainty, which equates to higher risk. Consider whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to STX, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on STX for some time, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current price multiple, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.If you want to dive deeper into Seagate Technology Holdings, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

PACCAR is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average.

I find that PACCAR’s ratio of 13.37x is below its peer average of 18.51x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Machinery industry. PACCAR’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta.

305,a7563eb3-30d8-3d36-819e-7259dfe8d721,UPS,2022-09-30,3 Top-Ranked Shipping Stocks Exporting Hefty Dividend Payouts,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-ranked-shipping-stocks-221310904.html,1664489590,STORY,"['FDX', 'ESEA', '^GSPC', 'INSW', 'UPS']","[The Zacks Transportation Sector came under the spotlight a few weeks back when FedEx FDX withdrew its FY23 earnings forecast, citing a volatile operating environment.The news spooked many investors, with FDX shares losing more than 20% in value the following trading period.Obviously, the announcement has potentially enormous ramifications, as FedEx's operations span worldwide, providing us with a decent feel of consumer sentiment.However, many of the issues FedEx speaks on seem company-specific, not necessarily a reflection of the Transportation Sector as a whole.For example, a shakeup within management following long-time CEO Fred Smith’s departure and lingering issues from a worse-than-expected integration of TNT Express have been thorns on the company’s side.Further, the slashed guidance was given just in June, the same month Fred Smith stepped down.On the contrary, in its most recent earnings report, United Parcel Service UPS reported a notably strong quarter and even reaffirmed its 2022 guidance in the face of challenging business conditions.While there are, no doubt, macroeconomic forces at play negatively impacting the Transportation Sector, it’s vital to know that operating issues have been haunting FedEx for some time now.In fact, a part of the Zacks Transportation Sector, the Zacks Transportation – Shipping Industry, is chugging along just fine in 2022, up more than 20% vs. the S&amp;P 500’s nearly 22% decline. This is illustrated in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor those looking to tap into the industry, three highly-ranked stocks in the realm – International Seaways INSW, SFL Corp. SFL, and Euroseas Ltd. ESEA – would all provide precisely that.Below is a chart illustrating the share performance of all three companies YTD with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a deeper dive into each one.Euroseas Ltd. Euroseas operates in the dry cargo, dry bulk, and container shipping markets. Analysts have been bullish across several timeframes over the last 60 days, helping land the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEuroseas’ growth prospects are stellar; earnings are forecasted to climb a triple-digit 150% Y/Y in FY22 and a further double-digit 31% in FY23.Top-line growth is also very apparent; the FY22 revenue estimate of $196 million is double what it raked in during FY21 ($98 million).ESEA rewards its shareholders handsomely – the company’s annual dividend yield was raised to 9.5% in 2022, paired with a sustainable 17% payout ratio.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd for the cherry on top, shares are cheap; the company’s 0.8X forward price-to-sales ratio reflects a steep 47% discount relative to its Transportation Sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSFL Corp. SFL Corp. owns and operates vessels and offshore-related assets primarily in Bermuda, Cyprus, Malta, Liberia, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the Marshall Islands. The company’s near-term earnings outlook has turned visibly bright over the last several months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike ESEA, SFL Corp. sports a mighty strong dividend; SFL's annual dividend yields 9.7% but with a payout ratio sitting higher at 73% of earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, SFL has a strong earnings track record, exceeding revenue and earnings estimates in its last four quarters. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInternational Seaways International Seaways, Inc. is a tanker company providing energy transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products. Analysts have had a bullish stance on the company’s near-term earnings outlook as of late.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchINSW’s annual dividend yield comes in at 1.4%, notably lower than its Zacks Sector. Still, the company has upped its payout twice over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, INSW’s growth prospects are inspiring; earnings are forecasted to skyrocket a triple-digit 300% in FY22 and a further 34% in FY23. That’s paired with projections of 150% top-line growth in FY22 and 2% in FY23.Bottom LineWhile FedEx’s FDX announcement surely spooked the world, the issues appear to be more company-specific than representative of the entire Transportation Sector.As mentioned, United Parcel Service UPS had a notably strong quarter, reaffirming its FY22 guidance.For those looking to tap into the relative strength the Zacks Transportation – Shipping Industry has been displaying, all three stocks above - International Seaways INSW, SFL Corp. SFL, and Euroseas Ltd. ESEA – would all provide precisely that.Further, all three sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), telling us that their near-term earnings outlook is fruitful.The strong Zacks Rank paired with the companies’ substantial payouts is a beautiful combination.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:UPS) Investors Are Less Pessimistic Than Expected",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-parcel-inc-nyse-ups-130014273.html,1664456414,STORY,['UPS'],"[There wouldn't be many who think United Parcel Service, Inc.'s (NYSE:UPS) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 13.3x is worth a mention when the median P/E in the United States is similar at about 14x. Although, it's not wise to simply ignore the P/E without explanation as investors may be disregarding a distinct opportunity or a costly mistake.United Parcel Service certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is moderate because investors think this strong earnings performance might be about to tail off. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be feeling optimistic about the future direction of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service peKeen to find out how analysts think United Parcel Service's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Some Growth For United Parcel Service?United Parcel Service's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 79% gain to the company's bottom line. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 129% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 3.6% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.6% per annum, which is noticeably more attractive.With this information, we find it interesting that United Parcel Service is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. Apparently many investors in the company are less bearish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. Maintaining these prices will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the shares eventually.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On United Parcel Service's P/EGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Our examination of United Parcel Service's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support a more positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.You always need to take note of risks, for example - United Parcel Service has 2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Walmart Inc. (WMT).

The company’s exposure to catastrophe loss induces earnings volatility and also affects the property and casualty underwriting results of Berkshire. Huge capital expenditures remain a headwind for the company.However, Berkshire Hathaway is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies measured by premium volume. Berkshire's inorganic growth story remains impressive with strategic acquisitions. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and indicates the company's financial flexibility.Continued insurance business growth fuels increase in float, drive earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses are delivering improved results with increased revenues over the past few years. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.(You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Exxon Mobil shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated – International industry over the past year (+51.1% vs. +27.2%). The company’s bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play. The company made three oil discoveries in the Stabroek Block, which will increase its recoverable resources estimates to 11 billion oil-equivalent barrels.ExxonMobil also has a strong presence in the prolific Permian Basin, where it expects to boost production volumes by 25% in 2022. The company reported strong second-quarter earnings, owing to higher realized commodity prices and solid refinery utilization.ExxonMobil generated cash flow of $20.9 billion from operations and asset divestments in the second quarter. Also, it has significantly lower debt exposure than other integrated majors. Hence, ExxonMobil is considered a preferred energy firm to own now.(You can read the full research report on Exxom Mobil here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Walmart shares have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry over the past year (-4.5% vs. -3.0%). The company’s consolidated operating income and earnings per share view suggest a decline from the year-ago period figures. The company is encountering cost pressure associated with fuel prices, supply chain and excess inventory. Cost inflation and markdowns hurt its gross margin in the second quarter.However, Walmart has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance both store and online experience. Walmart has been particularly gaining from its efforts to boost delivery services through acquisitions and partnerships.The company’s U.S. comp sales continued to benefit from an increased market share in grocery in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein the top line grew year over year.

However, its weak solvency position remains a bottleneck.Market Share Gains Aid Keurig Dr Pepper's (KDP) Top LinePer the Zacks analyst, Keurig witnesses market share gains from higher household penetration in hot and cold beverages, which is likely to continue. This is supported by marketing and innovation plansSurging Orders to Drive Fortive (FTV) Amid High LeveragePer the Zacks analyst,, Fortive's performance is gaining from increased orders for both software and hardware offerings. However, stiff competition and leveraged balance sheet remain concerns.A Wide Array of Services Continue to Aid AMN Healthcare (AMN)The Zacks analyst is upbeat about AMN Healthcare's expanded portfolio serving a diverse and growing healthcare talent-related needs despite its operation in a fiercely competitive niche space.AmEx (AXP) to Gain From Rising Consumer Spending &amp; BuyoutsPer the Zacks analyst, increased consumer spending and economic recovery will boost volumes, and buyouts would trigger inorganic growth for American Express.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Cemex and Martin Marietta are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that CX's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.CX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.67, while MLM has a forward P/E of 24.08. We also note that CX has a PEG ratio of 0.46. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. MLM currently has a PEG ratio of 1.58.Another notable valuation metric for CX is its P/B ratio of 0.47. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, MLM has a P/B of 2.94.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to CX's Value grade of A and MLM's Value grade of C.CX stands above MLM thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that CX is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The major stock indexes, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500, have fallen 18.3%, 29.4% and 22%, respectively, year to date (YTD).The equity market has been hammered by recession fears, inflationary pressure and soaring interest rates. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has further increased worries for investors about the global economic recovery.Technology is among the most-battered sectors amid a broader market sell-off this year so far. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, which seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the Technology Select Sector Index, has lost approximately 28% of its value YTD.Tech companies are witnessing lower demand for their products and solutions as organizations are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. In July 2022, Gartner lowered its forecast for worldwide IT spending growth rate to 3% from 4% mentioned earlier. The research firm’s report highlights that 2022 IT spending growth will be much slower than 2021 due to spending cutbacks across devices, software, IT services and communication services areas.Additionally, the sector is suffering from inflationary pressure, higher wages and currency fluctuations. Supply-chain disruptions due to an acute shortage of chips and several other components are affecting the profitability of the companies in the space.The aforementioned challenges are likely to persist in the near term, thereby negatively impacting the overall financial performances of the majority of tech stocks. We believe that investing in high-quality dividend-paying tech stocks like — Broadcom AVGO, Analog Devices ADI, NetApp NTAP and Amdocs Limited DOX— amid the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and the highly volatile market scenario might fetch handsome returns.Story continuesA stock with a history of increasing dividends is considered healthy and offers a capital appreciation opportunity irrespective of stock market movements.

314,d777c2eb-3ef5-3374-ac93-be863c1b736b,PPL,2022-09-30,PPL (PPL) Forms 'Hammer Chart Pattern': Time for Bottom Fishing?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ppl-ppl-forms-hammer-chart-135501682.html,1664459701,STORY,['PPL'],"[The price trend for PPL (PPL) has been bearish lately and the stock has lost 7.6% over the past two weeks. However, the formation of a hammer chart pattern in its last trading session indicates that the stock could witness a trend reversal soon, as bulls might have gained significant control over the price to help it find support.While the formation of a hammer pattern is a technical indication of nearing a bottom with potential exhaustion of selling pressure, rising optimism among Wall Street analysts about the future earnings of this energy and utility holding company is a solid fundamental factor that enhances the prospects of a trend reversal for the stock.1-month candlestick chart for PPLUnderstanding Hammer Chart and the Technique to Trade ItThis is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.'In simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price.When it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal.Hammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors.Like every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators.Story continuesHere's What Increases the Odds of a Turnaround for PPLAn upward trend in earnings estimate revisions that PPL has been witnessing lately can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side. That's because empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.The consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the last 30 days. This means that the Wall Street analysts covering PPL are majorly in agreement about the company's potential to report better earnings than what they predicted earlier.If this is not enough, you should note that PPL currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. And stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 usually outperform the market. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Moreover, a Zacks Rank of 2 for PPL is a more conclusive indication of a potential trend reversal, as the Zacks Rank has proven to be an excellent timing indicator that helps investors identify precisely when a company's prospects are beginning to improve.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, it remained under pressure from recessionary fears.On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures settled at $81.23 a barrel yesterday. Investors should know that oil slipped to a nine-month low of around $77 earlier in the week — the lowest since January.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Sep 23.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 215,000 barrels compared to expectations of a 300,000-barrel decrease per the analysts. The combination of a surge in exports, lower imports and a dip in domestic production accounted for the stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer even as refinery demand contracted.Total domestic stocks now stand at 430.6 million barrels — 2.9% more than the year-ago figure but 2% lower than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) rose 692,000 barrels to 25.7 million barrels.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover increased from 26.7 days in the previous week to 26.9 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 28.2 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies decreased for the second time in three weeks. The 2.4 million-barrel fall was primarily attributable to a surge in demand. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would rise 900,000 barrels. At 212.2 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 4.3% less than the year-earlier level and 6% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) dropped after rising for four weeks in a row. The 2.9 million-barrel fall reflected an uptick in demand and lower production. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply draw of some 100,000 barrels. Despite the recent decreases, current inventories — at 114.4 million barrels — are 11.8% below the year-ago level and 20% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at 90.6%, fell 3% from the prior week.Story continuesFinal WordWTI prices recently posted its longest run of weekly losses in 2022 following the Federal Reserve's decision to hike interest rates further in line with many other central banks across the world to step up the fight against soaring inflation. The tightening monetary policies have sparked concerns about a possible recession and, consequently, slowing crude demand. A stronger greenback, which can weaken dollar-denominated commodities like crude, also contributed to the downside.What stands out is that rates may not have peaked yet, and more toughness could be in store for the remainder of this year and 2023. This is because attempts are being made to cool the 40-year high inflation and prevent it from becoming entrenched.However, the U.S. benchmark has regained some ground in the wake of EIA’s bullish inventory report. Prices also drew support from the greenback’s climbdown from a 20-year high, which can strengthen dollar-denominated commodities like crude.As it is, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group (OPEC+) agreeing on a production curtailment, the Oil/Energy market has enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.As a matter of fact, the Energy Select Sector SPDR — an assortment of the largest U.S. companies thronging the space — has risen nearly 31% year to date against a 24% loss for the broader S&amp;P 500 benchmark.Consequently, three of the top five gainers of the S&amp;P 500 this year are all energy-related names: Occidental Petroleum OXY, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Hess Corporation HES.Occidental Petroleum: OXY is the top-performing S&amp;P 500 stock in 2022, with a gain of 114%.

It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 21.6%, on average.OXY has a projected earnings growth rate of 331.8% for this year.

""This shines a light (on the fact) that assets managers and investment funds are prepared for a new arrival of agribusiness companies (to the stock market),"" he said.Brazil's booming farm sector accounts for around 25% of the national GDP, considering the industries and services, Colpo noted.For that reason, it is important that investors are educated about the sector, where the typical seasonality of crops often affects companies' results, he said.Fabio Nazari, a partner at investment bank BTG Pactual, who moderated the panel Colpo took part in, also showed confidence in a new wave of agribusiness IPOs.""The agribusiness sector is underrepresented on the Brazilian stock exchange, based on what it means for Brazil and the countries in the world,"" Nazari said.BTG's credit exposure to Brazilian agribusiness companies is almost 20 billion reais ($3.70 billion), or around 20% of its loan portfolio, bank CEO Roberto Sallouti said.In two years, BTG led share offerings for almost 11 billion reais, he said.

LEVI is likely to register top-line growth year over year when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings on Oct 6. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues stands at $1,624 million, which indicates an improvement of about 7.9% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s tally.However, the bottom line is likely to decrease from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading. Although the consensus estimate for quarterly earnings has been stable over the past 30 days at 37 cents, the same suggests a plunge of 22.9% from the year-earlier fiscal quarter’s actuals.A glimpse of LEVI’s performance over the trailing four quarters shows that it delivered an earnings surprise of 16.1%, on average. In the last reported quarter, Levi Strauss’ earnings beat the consensus mark by 26.1%.Key Factors to NoteLevi Strauss is benefiting from its robust omnichannel initiatives and brand strength. LEVI continuously strengthens its omnichannel capabilities, including Buy Online, Pick-up In Store, line-queuing, same-day delivery, mobile checkout and return capabilities comprising contactless returns. Gains from e-commerce, direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels might have boosted LEVI’s top-line performance in the fiscal third quarter. Also, demand across a diversified portfolio, strategic price increases and the launch of innovative products are likely to have benefited Levi Strauss’ top line.The aforementioned factors buoy investors’ optimism on the stock. However, the challenging economic backdrop, including the supply-chain bottlenecks and inflationary pressures, remains a concern. On its last earnings call, management had expected deleveraged SG&amp;A expenses for the fiscal third quarter. These factors might have hurt LEVI’s bottom line in the quarter under review.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Levi Strauss this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.

Sluggishness in both Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segments hurt sales.In the fiscal second quarter, the Retail Pharmacy segment's revenues fell 1.1% due to a reduction in COVID-19 vaccines and testings as well as store closures, offset by higher acute and maintenance prescriptions. Retail Pharmacy same-store sales were up 5.6%, driven by an 8% rise in pharmacy sales, partly offset by the 0.3% dip in front-end same-store sales.

Players in the industry need to walk a tightrope this festive season to woo budget-conscious shoppers. Truly speaking, rising prices of groceries and other essentials are compelling consumers to hold back on discretionary spending, and industry participants might turn to promotions and discounts to attract bargain hunters.Retailers are keeping their fingers crossed and pinning hopes on stimulus savings from last year, steady wage gains and a lower unemployment rate that should help keep demand alive. Per Mastercard SpendingPulse, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, are anticipated to increase 7.1% from a year earlier during the traditional holiday period that runs from Nov 1-Dec 24. While in-store retail sales are projected to increase 7.9%, e-commerce is expected to rise 4.2%.According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, “With holiday shopping slated to begin early again this year, some of the season’s retail growth is expected to be pulled forward in October as consumers hunt for early deals. Key promotional days like Black Friday weekend are also expected to make a strong return along with Christmas Eve, which falls on a Saturday, slated to be among the biggest days for retailers and last-minute shoppers.”No wonder, the season, which accounts for a sizable chunk of yearly revenues, is a make or break for retailers. Evidently, retailers need to channelize their strength and make strategic investments to provide consumers fast, convenient and safe shopping experience, be it offline or online. Ulta Beauty, Inc.

BBBY has continued its dry spell with the drab second-quarter fiscal 2022 results. Both top and bottom lines not only missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but also declined year over year.The home goods retailer has failed to bring in-demand styles on its shelves. Earlier, its efforts to launch more store-branded products went for a toss. The ongoing inflation has led to consumers cutting down on discretionary spending. However, the company is on track to attract customers with more national brands and discount coupons.Shares of BBBY moved up nearly 2% before the trading session on Sep 29. This might be due to a sequential improvement in certain areas. The company’s aggressive inventory-optimization actions, including accelerated markdowns and strategic promotions, aided its quarterly performance to some extent.The company has been witnessing strength in its Welcome Rewards loyalty program, with 1.3 million members by the end of this August. New members also account for higher transaction values and frequent purchases across all three banners. Also, its buybuy BABY business continues to gain a strong market share.Encouraged by such upsides, BBBY revealed plans to relaunch the Baby registry business by fiscal 2022, increase marketing investments and realize the strategic shift of its merchandise assortment to boost top-line growth.Consequently, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 24.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 10.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Q2 in DetailBed Bath &amp; Beyond has reported an adjusted loss of $3.22 per share in the fiscal second quarter against earnings of 4 cents in the year-ago quarter.

The Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support, Philadelphia, PA provided the award.Valued at $168.8 million, the contract is scheduled to be completed by September 2024. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will repair two flight control surfaces used on the F/A-18E/F and E/A-18G aircraft.The majority of the work in relation to this contract will be carried out in Jacksonville, FL.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk.  Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during the 2021-2026 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any conditions.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 1.9% over 2021’s reported figure.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.4%. The company has a solid four-quarter earnings surprise of 64.46%, on average.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Textron Aviation’s military trainer and defense aircraft include the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXT’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 6% from the 2021 reported figure.Price MovementShares of Boeing have lost 39.3% in the past 12 months compared with the industry’s decline of 21.1%Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankBoeing currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

333,062e399c-b5fc-383a-84be-ed853c26428a,KO,2022-09-30,5 Dividend Growth Stocks to Beat Market Volatility,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-dividend-growth-stocks-beat-105010657.html,1664535010,STORY,"['BCC', 'NSP', 'KO', 'AZN', 'GD']","[The year 2022 has been roiled by huge volatility and uncertainty, which have raised the appeal of dividend investing. Dividend stocks are major sources of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk even though these do not offer dramatic price appreciation.In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — The Coca-Cola Company KO, General Dynamics Corporation GD, AstraZeneca plc AZN, Boise Cascade BCC, and Insperity Inc. NSP — that could be compelling picks amid market volatility.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation than simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&amp;P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environments.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 17.Here are the five of the 17 stocks that fit the bill:Georgia-based Coca-Cola, a beverage company, manufactures, markets, and sells various nonalcoholic beverages worldwide. The company provides sparkling soft drinks; flavored and enhanced water, and sports drinks; juice, dairy, and plant–based beverages; tea and coffee; and energy drinks.

338,ad292a0e-3d82-352f-ba38-1d855ed853b7,KO,2022-09-30,Here's Why You Should Buy PepsiCo (PEP) Ahead of Q3 Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-buy-pepsico-pep-152503830.html,1664465103,STORY,"['PEP', 'FMX', 'KO']","[PepsiCo Inc. PEP looks well-poised for growth in the third quarter of 2022, driven by the resilience and strength of global beverage and convenient food businesses. It expects to benefit from delivering convenience, variety and value proposition to customers through its brands. The company continues to gain from investments in brands, go-to-market systems, supply chains, manufacturing capacity and digital capabilities to build competitive advantages.The company boasts a robust surprise trend. It reported the 16th straight quarter of a sales beat in second-quarter 2022. The company’s revenues and earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year.Net revenues improved 5.2% year over year, benefiting from volume growth and robust price/mix. Unit volume improved 3% and 6% year over year for the convenient food and beverage businesses, respectively. On an organic basis, revenues grew 13% year over year, driven by broad-based growth across categories and geographies. Earnings increased 8.1% year over year. In constant currency, core earnings were up 10% from the year-ago period, backed by the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives.PepsiCo’s shares have rallied 12.1% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 1.6%. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock’s performance also compares favorably against declines of 7.3% for the Consumer Staples sector and 16.4% for the S&amp;P 500. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors to Propel GrowthStrength in the global beverage has been significantly contributing to PepsiCo’s revenue growth in the past few quarters. On a year-over-year basis, organic revenues grew 8% for the beverage business in the second quarter. Gains in the beverage business were driven by market share growth in the liquid refreshment beverage category, with share gains in the carbonated soft drinks, Ready-to-Drink Tea and water categories.In North America, the PBNA segment reported year-over-year organic revenue growth of 9% in the second quarter, backed by investments in innovation, pricing and execution. Many of its key brands performed exceptionally well in the quarter. The company continues to invest in its Zero Sugar products and other functional beverages in the carbonated and non-carbonated categories to offer more choices to consumers.PepsiCo has the competitive advantage of selling both snacks and beverages, which are complementary food categories. On a year-over-year basis, organic revenues grew 17% for the convenient food business in the second quarter. In the second quarter, both Frito-Lay North America (“FLNA”) and Quaker Foods North America (“QFNA”) delivered robust organic revenue growth. The FLNA and QFNA businesses delivered revenue growth of 14% and 18%, respectively, in the second quarter, both on a reported and organic basis.Growth in FLNA was driven by the continued shift of consumers toward simple pleasures that offer value, convenience and variety. The segment’s results were aided by market share growth in both macro-snack and savory snack categories. Revenues for the Quaker business benefited from market share gains in the rice and pasta, lite snacks, ready-to-eat cereal, and snack bar categories as it continued to capitalize on the elevated demand for tasty products that deliver convenience and value.PEP is also positioned to gain from continued focus on driving greater efficiency and effectiveness by driving down costs and plowing back these savings to develop scale and core capabilities. In 2019, the company delivered in excess of $1 billion in productivity savings, keeping it on track with its goal of generating productivity savings of at least $1 billion annually through 2023. The company expects to achieve this productivity goal through savings generated from restructuring actions.The actions are likely to position the company to further simplify, synchronize and automate processes; re-engineer the go-to-market and information systems; simplify the organization; and optimize its manufacturing and supply-chain footprint. As part of the restructuring actions, the company estimates incurring pre-tax charges of $2.5 billion through 2023 (with a cash portion of $1.6 billion). Savings from the productivity and restructuring plans should go a long way in driving the top line and margins.Story continuesConclusionAlthough supply-chain disruptions and inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs remain dragging, we believe that the company’s strong portfolio of beverage and convenient food brands position it to bolster growth in the long run.Other Stocks to ConsiderWe have highlighted some other top-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Coca-Cola KO, Fomento Economico Mexicano FMX and Constellation Brands STZ.Coca-Cola, the Atlanta, GA-based global beverage giant, currently has a Zacks Rank #2. The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 6.4% for three to five years. Shares of KO have gained 8.6% in the past year.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Coca-Cola’s current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 9.8% and 6%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported figures.

339,54757da0-4ce3-31cd-82c2-be6502368cb1,KO,2022-09-30,Digital Investments & Premiumization to Aid AB InBev (BUD),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/digital-investments-premiumization-aid-ab-150803021.html,1664464083,STORY,"['ABI', 'BUD', 'FMX', 'KOF', 'KO']","[Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV BUD, alias AB InBev, has been in investors good books thanks to its unique commercial strategy, strong brand portfolio and investments in operation excellence. This has been aiding market share growth across most key markets. The expansion of the Beyond Beer portfolio, and investments in B2B platforms, e-commerce and digital marketing bode well. The premiumization of the beer industry has been a key growth opportunity for AB InBev.Despite strong revenues, investors’ sentiments continue to be hurt by high costs and supply-chain headwinds, affecting margins. The company’s gross and EBIT margins declined in second-quarter 2022, driven by higher cost of sales and SG&amp;A expenses. Higher SG&amp;A expenses resulted from elevated supply-chain costs.Let’s take a sneak peek into the factors positioning BUD for growth.Premiumization &amp; Business MomentumContinued business momentum due to relentless execution, brand investments and accelerated digital transformation aided AB InBev’s second-quarter 2022 performance. The company is anticipated to retain the strong business momentum on continued premiumization efforts and favorable industry trends. The company has been investing in a diverse portfolio of global, international and crafts and specialty premium brands in its markets. Apart from the premium brands, BUD’s global brands lead the way in premiumization.Backed by the continued business momentum, AB InBev retained its upbeat view for 2022. It expects EBITDA growth in line with the medium-term outlook of 4-8%. BUD anticipates revenue growth to be higher than EBITDA growth, driven by strong volume and pricing.Digital ExpansionThe rapid expansion of its digital platform and leveraging of technology such as B2B sales and other e-commerce platforms have been key drivers for BUD. The company has been witnessing an acceleration in the B2B platforms, e-commerce and digital marketing trends, aiding growth for the past few months. The company’s proprietary B2B platform, BEES, is live in 18 markets and has reached 2.9 million monthly active users.In the broader beverage space, Coca-Cola KO has been witnessing a splurge in e-commerce, with the growth rate of the channel doubling in many countries. The company has been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities. KO is evolving into an organization that efficiently executes marketing, commercial, sales and distribution, both offline and online.Coca-Cola is strengthening consumer connections and further piloting numerous different digital-enabled initiatives through fulfillment methods, be it B2B to home or B2C platforms in many countries, to capture online demand for at-home consumption. Additionally, the online-to-offline partnerships with multiple food aggregators ensure beverage availability and visibility.Fomento Economico Mexicano FMX, alias FEMSA, is another beverage company focused on offering customers more options to make contactless purchases by intensifying digital and technology-driven initiatives across operations. The company’s Coca-Cola FEMSA KOF is leading the way with its omni-channel business, while FEMSA Comercio is progressing with the adoption of digital initiatives.Within its OXXO store chains, FEMSA is on track with investing in digital offerings, loyalty programs and fintech platforms to evolve stronger after the pandemic and over the long term. In the second quarter, FEMSA made progress on its digital efforts, with customer acquisition surpassing 15 million users. The users are part of the company’s digital ecosystem either through Spin by OXXO, OXXO Premia or both.Coca-Cola FEMSA is the flagship segment engaged in the production and distribution of carbonated beverages. The division is the largest Coca-Cola bottler in Latin America and the second-largest Coca-Cola bottler globally in terms of sales volume.Story continuesBeyond Beer InvestmentsAB InBev is steadfastly growing its Beyond Beer portfolio, including products like Ready-to-Drink beverages like canned wine and canned cocktails, hard seltzers, cider, and flavored malt beverages. The Beyond Beer trend has been recently gaining popularity due to the rise in demand for low-alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks.The company remains focused on expanding its Beyond Beer portfolio, which has also been aiding the top line. The Beyond Beer portfolio contributed more than $425 million to revenues in the second quarter. BUD witnessed double-digit growth in Brutal Fruit and Flying Fish in South Africa. In the United States, the company’s portfolio witnessed growth ahead of the industry in the spirits-based ready-to-drink segment, driven by its Cutwater and NUTRL vodka seltzer.Headwinds to OvercomeWhile AB InBev has been gaining from improving trends in key markets and continued premiumization in the majority of its markets, commodity cost inflation and higher supply-chain costs in some markets continue to be major headwinds. Higher commodity costs mainly resulted from increased aluminum and barley prices. Like others in the industry, the company expects higher commodity costs to continue, exerting pressure on input costs. BUD’s presence across various countries exposes it to negative currency translations. The company anticipates foreign currency to remain volatile.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Until this momentum to the downside improves, investors should shy away.About the Company Mohawk is headquartered in Calhoun, GA. The company was founded in 1982 and employs 43,000 people.Mohawk manufactures carpet, rugs, ceramic tile, laminate, wood, stone, and vinyl flooring. This makes the company sensitive to housing improvements, which has been hurt due to higher interest rates.The company has reorganized its business into three segments — Global Ceramic (35% of net sales), Flooring North America (Flooring NA) (37% of net sales), and Flooring Rest of the World (Flooring ROW) (28% of net sales).MHK is valued at $6 billion and has a Forward PE of 7. The company holds a Zacks Style Scores of “A” in Value, but “D” in Growth. The stock is a value play for most, but pays no dividend.  Q2 Earnings The company last reported EPS on July 28th, beating expectations by only 1%. Revenues came in slightly below expectations, but the company guided Q3 lower.Instead of the expect $4.14, the company now sees Q3 at a range of $3.33-3.43. The company announced they will cut expenses and implementing multiple restructuring projects to cut costs.Management said that they needed to adapt to current conditions to improve results. This means cost cutting by $30-$40 million annually.EstimatesBecause of the guide lower, analysts have been forced to lower their estimates.For the current quarter, over the last 60 days estimates have dropped 14%, from $4.05 to $3.47. For next quarter, the numbers have fallen 11% over the same time frame.  Story continuesAnalyst are not being as aggressive in dropping their numbers for next year, as they likely want to see how the cost cutting is implemented. For next year, estimates have fallen only 9%.Technical TakeLike most stocks this year, it is trading under all the moving averages. The 50-day MA is at $114 and the 200-day is at $135. These levels are significantly above the current trading price.The stock has been bleeding out and is looking for support. The next area of interest for the bulls is all the way down at $80. So, patience is suggested with this name.In SummaryMohawk is going to struggle as long as interest rates continue to go higher. The effect that rates have on housing and consumers will likely hurt earnings. Add in higher inflationary costs and the cost cutting program might not be enough to improve results.  For those interested in the home furnishing space, a better option in the sector might be Interface (TILE).

342,e924f222-04bd-3847-85d3-0a2e97e5bce6,INTU,2022-09-30,Intuit Inc. (INTU) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuit-inc-intu-trending-stock-130001717.html,1664456401,STORY,['INTU'],"[Intuit (INTU) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this maker of TurboTax, QuickBooks and other accounting software have returned -5.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -8.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Intuit falls in, has lost 10.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Intuit is expected to post earnings of $1.24 per share, indicating a change of -19% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +58.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $13.71 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +15.7%. This estimate has changed +2.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.75 indicates a change of +14.9% from what Intuit is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intuit is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for INTU _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Intuit, the consensus sales estimate of $2.49 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +24.2%. The $14.54 billion and $16.37 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +14.2% and +12.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIntuit reported revenues of $2.41 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.7%. EPS of $1.10 for the same period compares with $1.97 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.35 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.81%. The EPS surprise was +12.24%.Over the last four quarters, Intuit surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Intuit is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intuit. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Table 1 reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:Share-based compensation expenseAmortization of acquired technologyAmortization of other acquired intangible assetsGoodwill and intangible asset impairment chargesGains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assetsProfessional fees and transaction costs for business combinationsWe also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share:Gains and losses on debt and equity securities and other investmentsIncome tax effects and adjustmentsDiscontinued operationsWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit’s operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments, or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expense, amortization, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.Share-based compensation expenses. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units, and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.Amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets. When we acquire a business in a business combination, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the business and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired businesses. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete, and trade names.Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures non-cash charges to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair values.Gains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assets. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assets because they are unrelated to our ongoing business operating results.Professional fees and transaction costs for business combinations. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal, and accounting fees.Gains and losses on debt securities and other investments. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and gains and losses on other investments.Income tax effects and adjustments. We use a long-term non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating operating results and for planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate excludes the income tax effects of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments described above, and eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items which can vary in size and frequency. Based on our current long-term projections, we are using a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 24% for fiscal 2023. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for various reasons including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate. We will evaluate this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis and whenever any significant events occur which may materially affect this rate.Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table 1 include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, sales of available-for-sale debt securities and other investments, and disposals of business and long-lived assets.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220929005201/en/ContactsInvestorsKim WatkinsIntuit Inc.650-944-3324kim_watkins@intuit.comMediaAbby SmithIntuit Inc.408-839-6028abby_smith@intuit.com]"

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Stryker The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At StrykerOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the VP &amp; CFO, Glenn Boehnlein, for US$606k worth of shares, at about US$261 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$205. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last year Stryker insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does Stryker Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Stryker insiders own 11% of the company, worth about US$8.6b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Stryker Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Stryker insiders selling. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

346,bf350c26-d64a-3ad0-aca8-4c8e2387e5bb,DVA,2022-09-30,The 7 Most Undervalued Mid-Cap Stocks to Buy Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-most-undervalued-mid-cap-183125025.html,1664217085,STORY,"['GHM', 'SFM', 'BYD', 'NXST', 'KO', 'DVA']","[It’s up for debate whether the stock market downturn has reached or is close to reaching the “bottoming out” stage, but there are many opportunities out there. While most of the best opportunities are among stocks of the small-cap/”unknown” variety, there are also plenty of undervalued mid-cap stocks to buy now trading at low valuations.Although perhaps not to the extent seen with smaller names, many mid-caps, or stocks with market caps of between $2 and $10 billion, have become oversold, pushed to super-low forward valuations.Inflation, interest rates, and recession worries appear to have been priced into them, and then some. Overly discounted, this has created a situation where the risk and return proposition weighs heavily in your favor.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhy? Once current uncertainties pass, each of these seven undervalued mid-cap stocks to buy could experience a significant level of price appreciation. Ahead of this potentially playing out, consider adding them to your portfolio.BYDBoyd Gaming$47.24COKECoca-Cola Consolidated$416.98DVADaVita$86.03GHCGraham Holdings$535.34NXSTNexstar Media Group$172.67PBHPrestige Consumer Healthcare$50.48SFMSprouts Farmers Market$27.50Boyd Gaming (BYD)a room of slot machines in a casino to represent gambling stocksSource: ShutterstockIf you believe that the next gaming industry downturn will not be as severe as the late 2000s downturn. If yes, Boyd Gaming (NYSE:BYD) may be the best way to make that wager. Based in Las Vegas, Boyd owns what are known as “locals casinos” in its hometown, along with 17 regional gaming properties outside of Nevada.Per JMP Securities’ Jordan Bender, Boyd’s heavy exposure to the Vegas locals market is a positive. Not only do macro factors remain healthy in Nevada. The continued growth in Nevada’s population serves as a long-term tailwind for the company’s core business.Trading for just 8.1 times earnings, investors are pricing BYD stock as if a major earnings drop is in the cards. If earnings hold steady over the next year, and the company achieves further success with its online gaming segment, the market may decide to re-rate the stock. At the moment, BYD is one of the top undervalued mid-cap stocks to buy.Story continuesCoca-Cola Consolidated (COKE)Coca-Cola Consolidated sign outside of their building. COKE Stock.Source: Jonathan Weiss / ShutterstockBlue chip Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) may be a blue chip and a dividend aristocrat. However, investors looking for a defensive stock in today’s bear market may want to choose Coca-Cola Consolidated (NASDAQ:COKE) instead.Why buy shares in Coke’s largest bottler, instead of Coca-Cola itself? Mainly, valuation. KO stock’s high-quality bona fides are fully reflected in its current valuation (about 23 times earnings). While not overvalued per se, a further rise in interest rates could put more pressure on its valuation.In contrast, COKE stock trades at a discounted valuation of 13.8x earnings. Coca-Cola Consolidated’s current valuation may leave it at less risk of multiple compression. Not only that, it leaves it well-positioned to benefit from multiple expansion, once the bull market returns. Already a strong performer over the last decade, moving up from small-cap to mid-cap, COKE still stands to keep delivering high returns.DaVita (DVA)Nurse holding a tablet with icons representing different aspects of healthcare and healthcare data representing CANO stock.Source: metamorworks / ShutterstockDaVita (NYSE:DVA) is one of the best undervalued mid-cap stocks to buy. Shares in the kidney dialysis center operator plunged due to declining earnings over the past few quarters. This may appear to be a red flag. However, the situation may not be as dire as it may seem at first glance.As InvestorPlace’s Will Ashworth argued last month, while earnings per share (or EPS) were down last quarter, DaVita did manage to beat sell-side EPS estimates. Furthermore, the company’s EPS is expected to recover in 2023, rising to $9.81, well above the $8.90 in diluted EPS reported in 2021.With a recession-proof business, and Warren Buffett’s seal of approval, DVA stock offers investors strong fundamentals at a rock bottom price. Its shares currently trade for just 8.8 times the above-mentioned 2023 EPS figure.Graham Holdings (GHC)several text books stacked up on each otherSource: ShutterstockKnown as the The Washington Post Company until 2013, upon the sale of its famed newspaper to Jeff Bezos, Graham Holdings (NYSE:GHC) is often considered a “mini-Berkshire,” and not just because of Warren Buffett’s 40-year association with the company.Over the last decade, Graham Holdings has increased its diversification efforts considerably. Beyond its move decades back into broadcasting and test-prep (Kaplan) now owns a slew of small industrial companies, a Washington, D.C.-area automotive dealership chain, and a digital advertising firm, among other holdings.With a forward valuation of 9.6 times estimated earnings, GHC stock continues to have a “conglomerate discount” applied to it, as was the case when I last wrote about Graham Holdings back in 2020. However, considering its history of spin-offs, like Cable One (NYSE:CABO) in 2015, Graham could eventually decide to spin-off Kaplan (its largest unit), helping to unlock value for shareholders.Nexstar Media Group (NXST)A blurred image of a television studioSource: chanonnat srisura / Shutterstock.comNexstar Media Group (NASDAQ:NXST) is a great way to make a contrarian wager on the future of television broadcasting. This undervalued mid-cap stock to buy and owner-operator of TV stations is generating considerable cash flow right now. This is due to both traditional TV ad revenue, plus broadcast retransmission fees received from cable operators.The market is not confident such high profitability can continue. Hence, NXST stock at a very low valuation, even when you account for next year’s expected decline in EPS. Shares trade for just 8.3 times estimated 2023 earnings. However, this may be an overreaction.Why? Cord cutting is a major headwind, yet there is a big tailwind to counter it. That would be the rollout of NEXTGEN TV, which opens the door for further monetization of its broadcast spectrum assets. This could help prevent a big decline in profitability, resulting in the investors giving NXST star a higher valuation.Prestige Consumer Healthcare (PBH)a photo of a stethoscope laying atop medical papersSource: ShutterstockAs its corporate name suggests, Prestige Consumer Healthcare (NYSE:PBH) is a provider of over-the-counter (or OTC) healthcare products. Its brands include Chloraseptic, Clear Eyes, Compound W, and Luden’s. It’s another top undervalued mid-cap stock to buy.A seller of everyday remedies, Prestige will likely fare okay during a recession. Interestingly enough, investors haven’t exactly flocked to PBH stock as a defensive play. Instead, the stock has fallen around 17% in 2022, and now trades at a low multiple for a company in its industry (12 times forward earnings).Once macro challenges become fully absorbed by the market, and the recovery begins, Prestige shares could move to a valuation more befitting of a consumer staples stock. For example, a move back to a price-to-earnings (or P/E) ratio of 15 would mean a move back to $63 per share. In other words, 25% potential upside compared to PBH’s current stock price.Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM)Woman in a market holding sign that reads ""Organic""Source: ShutterstockShares in high-end grocery chain Sprouts Farmers Market (NASDAQ:SFM) have held up well compared to the overall market. While major indices are down by double-digits since late last year, SFM stock has traded sideways during this timeframe. It’s another undervalued mid-cap stock to take a look at.However, in the years ahead, Sprouts stock could deliver returns that are far more satisfying. In the near-term, its results could continue to come in stronger than expected.

Although historically September is the worst-performing month on Wall Street, this year it is likely to be the most disastrous in a decade courtesy of an ultra-hawkish Fed. The central bank has raised the benchmark lending rate by 3% year to date.As the Fed has given a clear indication of the continuation of a rigorous interest rate hike and tighter monetary control, a global financial crisis looms larger. Market participants are pricing the cost of an imminent recession in stock valuation.Currently, the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 indexes are in bear market territory. Surprisingly, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite — which is most susceptible to the Fed’s higher interest rate regime — is currently outside the bear market zone. Wall Street seems grossly oversold despite the continuation of the Fed’s tighter monetary control. Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have plunged 18.3%, 22% and 29.4%, respectively.Several Nasdaq Composite listed stocks are currently available at attractive valuations. Investment in these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should be fruitful to gain in the near term. Here are five such stocks — Airbnb Inc. ABNB, Fortinet Inc. FTNT, VeriSign Inc. VRSN, CDW Corp. CDW and Zscaler Inc. ZS.Nasdaq Composite Exits Bear MarketIn the last two coronavirus-ridden years, the Nasdaq Composite recorded an astonishing rally of more than 140%. The tech-heavy index recorded its all-time high of 16212.23 on Nov 22, 2021. The meteoric rise of the technology stocks was the sole reason for this impressive rally. Consequently, investors started profit booking in this sector from the beginning of 2022.Moreover, mounting inflation compelled the Fed to significantly raise the benchmark interest rate from March this year. The central bank also imposed tougher monetary control sucking liquidity from the economy and raising the market’s risk-free returns.Story continuesA higher interest rate is detrimental to the growth sectors like technology. Consequently, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite entered the bear market on Mar 7, 2022 after declining more than 20% from its recent high recorded on Nov 22.After entering the bear market, the Nasdaq Composite registered its recent low of 10,565.14 on Jun 16. Finally, on Aug 4, the Nasdaq Composite exited the bear market after rallying more than 20% from its recent low.After forming the new bull market, the Nasdaq Composite reached its highest at 13,181.09 on Aug 16. Thereafter, the tech-laden index has taken a downturn once again following a tougher-than-expected monetary stance by the Fed.Despite the recent decline, the Nasdaq Composite has fallen just 16.2% from its recent high. As a result, the index is currently well outside the bear market territory.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five Nasdaq Composite listed technology stocks currently trading at a deep discount to their 52-week highs. These stocks have strong potential for the rest of 2022 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAirbnb is riding on an improvement in the travel industry. Continued recovery in both longer-distance and cross-border travel owing to a reduction in travel restrictions is benefiting ABNB’s Nights &amp; Experience bookings. Additionally, growth in Average Daily Rates and Gross Booking Value is acting as a tailwind.Growing active listings in Latin America, North America and EMEA are contributing well to the top line. Growing sales and marketing initiatives along with continuous efforts to upgrade various aspects of the Airbnb service are helping the company gain momentum among hosts and guests.Airbnb has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.5% over the last 30 days. ABNB is currently trading at a 47.9% discount from its 52-week high.Fortinet is benefiting from rising demand for security and networking products amid the coronavirus crisis as a huge global workforce is working remotely. FTNT is also benefiting from robust growth in Fortinet Security Fabric, cloud and Software-defined Wide Area Network offerings.Moreover, continued deal wins, especially those of high value, are solid drivers. Higher IT spending on cybersecurity is further expected to aid Fortinet grow faster than the security market. Also, focus on enhancing its unified threat management portfolio through product development and acquisitions is a tailwind for FTNT.Fortinet has an expected earnings growth rate of 31.3% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 2.9% over the last 60 days. FTNT is currently trading at a 32.8% discount from its 52-week high.VeriSign provides Internet infrastructure services that include domain name registry services and infrastructure assurance services. VRSN’s performance is gaining from growth in .com and .net domain name registrations. VeriSign ended second-quarter 2022 with 174.3 million .com and .net domain name registrations, up 2.2% year over year.VRSN will be hiking the annual registry-level wholesale fee for each new and renewal .net domain name registration to $9.92, from $9.02 with effect from Feb 1, 2023.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.3% over the last 60 days. VRSN is currently trading at a 31% discount to its 52-week high.CDW’s performance is benefiting from the digital transformation taking place globally as well as higher revenue growth in Corporate, Small Business and CDW Canada segments owing to the ongoing focus on hybrid work and return to office solutions.Higher demand for products that enable operations’ continuity plan amid the pandemic is acting as a key catalyst for CDW. Growth in the healthcare end market, a resilient business model, and a solid product and solutions portfolio are key positives. Strategic acquisitions also bode well.CDW has an expected earnings growth rate of 21.2% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.8% over the last 60 days. CDW is currently trading at a 22.6% discount to its 52-week high.Zscaler is benefiting from the rising demand for cyber-security solutions owing to the slew of data breaches. Increasing demand for privileged access security on digital transformation and cloud-migration strategies is a key growth driver of ZS.Zscaler’s portfolio boosts its competitive edge and helps add users. Moreover, a strong presence across verticals, such as banking, insurance, healthcare, public sector, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications services and education, is safeguarding Zscaler from the pandemic’s negative impact. Also, recent acquisitions, like Smokescreen and Trustdome, are expected to enhance ZS’ portfolio.Zscaler has an expected earnings growth rate of 69.6% for the current year (for July 2023).

Insiders might have been better off holding onto their shares, given that the average selling price of US$144 is still below the current share price.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Sempra Sempra Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Senior VP, Peter Wall, sold US$370k worth of shares at a price of US$144 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$151). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 27% of Peter Wall's stake. Peter Wall was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of SempraI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Sempra insiders own about US$16m worth of shares. That equates to 0.02% of the company. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Sempra Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Sempra shares in the last quarter. We don't take much encouragement from the transactions by Sempra insiders. But it's good to see that insiders own shares in the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To help with this, we've discovered 5 warning signs (3 are concerning!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in Sempra.But note: Sempra may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The rising interest rates have been a thorn for equity investors. However, there are hidden bull markets all the time, and perhaps the best financial stocks are what investors should have a close eye on.Financial stocks have performed impressively regardless of economic cycles. For banks, particularly, the rising rates are a bullish indicator, but it’s perhaps the opposite for asset management companies. Hence, investors must do their due diligence before placing their bets on financial businesses.It’s important to have robust investment criteria based on profitability, top-line expansion, valuation and income. Moreover, it would also be the right move if investors could potentially find strong finance stocks that help make the best out of every adverse situation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmidst a myriad of choices at this time, I have curated seven of the best financial stocks you should add to your portfolios. These investments tick all the right boxes and offer a unique blend of the investment criteria mentioned above.OFSOFS Capital Corporation$7.69MSBIMidland States Bancorp$225.81 TRINTrinity Capital$13.38CINFCincinnati Financial$90.26ITUBItaú Unibanco$5.14SBNYSignature Bank$151.00RJFRaymond James$100.74OFS Capital Corporation (OFS)A laptop, pencil, pair of eyeglasses, and many coins rest on a wooden table.Source: ShutterstockOFS Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:OFS) is a small-cap financial services firm boasting a track record of incredible financial performance with robust profitability. It has had a penchant for rewarding its shareholders and currently offers a mind-boggling dividend yield of 13.50%.The company focuses on debt and equity financing for middle-market enterprises. The bulk of its portfolio is debt instruments that carry a floating rate, though, effectively protecting it from asset decline in a high-interest rate environment.Its portfolio covers multiple segments of a company’s capital structure, protecting it from major credit risks. Consequently, its recent results are in line with its historical averages, despite the troubling economic conditions while it trades at just 2.4 time’s forward sales estimates. This small-cap gem cannot be ignored at this time.Story continuesMidland States Bancorp (MSBI)Source: ShutterstockMidland States Bancorp (NASDAQ:MSBI) operates as a financial services holding company for the Midland States Bank. It offers an array of financial services, including mortgages, retail banking, commercial services and treasury management.Midland has operated a stable business that has grown its top line by roughly 10% over the past five years. Also, it comes with an attractive 4.7% dividend yield.Recent results have been relatively solid and in line with its historical performance. Its loan portfolio grew remarkably by 11% in its first half. However, it’s likely to slow down given the heightened interest rates.Nevertheless, its acquisition plans should keep loan growth stable. It boasts a large balance of variable-rate loans, which points to single-digit earnings growth for the remainder of the year.Trinity Capital (TRIN)An image of a businessman standing facing the camera with his hands in his pockets, his shadow projected behind him with his arms up and flexingSource: lassedesignen / ShutterstockTrinity Capital (NASDAQ:TRIN) is one of the more reputable names in the business development world, providing venture debt and equity financing to high-growth startups.Its business has demonstrated a strong ability to thrive in challenging market conditions and has continued to pay hefty dividends.Business development companies have done significantly better than other financial businesses during a heightened inflation environment. Venture capital funding typically slows down in such an environment, which increases venture debt demand.Therefore, startups have had to turn to venture debt from companies such as TRIN. Reports have shown that venture debt volumes in the U.S. have risen by an impressive 7.5% in the year’s first half. Additionally, TRIN’s investment commitments reached a record $608 million in the first half of this year.Cincinnati Financial (CINF)The logo for Cincinnati Financial is shown on a cellphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comCincinnati Financial (NADSAQ:CINF) is one of the leading property and casual insurers in the U.S. It accounts for roughly 1% of the total market, which is a tremendous feat given how fragmented the market is. With over $6 billion in annual premiums, it is among the top 25 insurers in its niche.CINF has had it rough over the past few quarters amidst a tough operating environment. Consequently, its share price has dipped by over 30% in the past six months. Its lackluster performance of late has done little to slow down the pace of shareholder rewards.CINF is one of the most appealing insurance companies and one of the market leaders in its niche in the U.S. It has one of the most attractive portfolios and has grown its payouts by over 60 years. Hence, with its stock trading at multi-year lows, it’s best to load up on it now.Itaú Unibanco (ITUB)The logo for Itaú Unibanco is seen on a sign.Source: SERGIO V S RANGEL / Shutterstock.comItaú Unibanco (NYSE:ITUB) operates as a full-service bank and has been around for almost a century.It’s the leading Brazilian bank in terms of sales and has more than 4,000 physical branches and a presence in 18 different countries, primarily in the Latin American region.Its business lines are highly diversified, including insurance, trading, credit, and other related services. The diversity allows it to effectively limit its risk exposure and grow its asset base over time.Recently, it’s been going all-in to expand its digital footprint. Its digital bank, called iti Itáu, targets a younger demographic that doesn’t have bank accounts.So far, iti Itáu has been an incredible inclusion to its portfolio, adding 16.7 million customers in the first quarter of this year. Considering how 70% of the Latin American population is unbanked or underbanked, Itaú’s digital arm has an amazing growth runway ahead.Signature Bank (SBNY)The logo for Signature Bank is displayed over the entrance to a building.Source: PL Gould / Shutterstock.comSignature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY) is a New York-based full-service commercial bank with a client-focused approach.It operates a balanced loan portfolio that has helped mitigate risks to an acceptably low level. Hence, it’s one of the few financial institutions that continue to perform well during these testing times.Its second-quarter results were a blow-out, beating earnings per share estimates by 4%. Loan growth was perhaps the best it’s been in several quarters, with the firm maintaining credit quality at the same time. Net interest income came in at $649.1 million for the quarter, a 42% improvement from the prior-year quarter.The improvement was driven by the expansion in interest-earning assets. Also, non-interest income was up by an amazing 61% to $37.7 million due to a bump in service charges. SBNY also declared a generous dividend of 56 cents per share, yielding a strong 1.43%.Raymond James (RJF)The logo for Raymond James (RJF) is seen on the side of a building.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comRaymond James (NYSE:RJF) is one of the most successful U.S.-based investment management firms.Its banking division has been a consistent performer, and its superior execution has led to it operating a robust margin profile.

RJF offers its lender greater flexibility in what they can charge clients. Hence, its results have been superb of late, posting yet another earnings beat in its third quarter.It’s the eighth straight quarter where the firm has beat analyst estimates on earnings which is an amazing achievement.

The benefits of AIR Recon DL are extended by these new features to nearly all Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) clinical procedures, covering all anatomies and enabling better image quality, shorter scan times, and enhanced patient experience.Already, GE Healthcare’s AIR Recon DL deep learning-based image reconstruction technology for MRI has fundamentally shifted the balance between image quality and scan time. Now, with the solution’s expanded compatibility from 2D to 3D imaging sequences, physicians can quickly and confidently diagnose patients with improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sharpness. 3D imaging provides for more clinical efficiency, allowing radiologists to eliminate the need for multiple 2D acquisitions - potentially leading to faster diagnosis.Additionally, AIR Recon DL is now compatible with PROPELLER, a motion-insensitive imaging sequence particularly important for anatomies susceptible to motion such as respiration during MRI exams, as well as pediatric, neurodegenerative, geriatric, and claustrophobic patients who have difficulty remaining physically still for the duration of an MRI scan. As a result, physicians can get sharper images without the need for repeat scans – translating to faster patient throughput, improved scheduling, shorter exam time, and faster diagnosis, helping to create an all-round better patient experience.As of September 2022, at least 3.5 million patients globally have been scanned with AIR Recon DL. According to a recent AIR Recon DL 3D and PROPELLER reader study:100% of the participants said that the deep learning solution provides better signal-to-noise ratio and better or equivalent image sharpness than conventional image reconstruction;99% also said AIR Recon DL provides better or equivalent lesion conspicuity; andReports also indicate up to 50% reduction in exam times, creating efficiency in workflow and increased productivity2.Story continues""By expanding AIR Recon DL to 3D and PROPELLER, GE Healthcare has closed the gaps in our ability to provide improved image quality and patient experience to all our patients across exam types, particularly for brain imaging where we rely heavily on 3D sequences and musculoskeletal imaging where PROPELLER is important for reducing image quality variability and eliminating repeat sequences due to motion,"" says Dr. Tiron Pechet, Radiologist and Assistant Medical Director at Shields Health Care Group.AIR Recon DL and the recent extensions are available on new GE Healthcare MRI scanners, and as an upgrade for the vast majority of GE Healthcare’s installed 1.5T and 3.0T MRI systems. Beyond its efficiency and productivity benefits to the industry, this upgrade will enable previously installed scanners to refresh and function like new systems – allowing imaging facilities to enjoy the most advanced imaging capabilities on their existing systems, while saving on capital expenditure amid today’s cost constrained environment.About GE Healthcare:GE Healthcare is the $17.7 billion healthcare business of GE (NYSE: GE). As a leading global medical technology, pharmaceutical diagnostics and digital solutions innovator, GE Healthcare enables clinicians to make faster, more informed decisions through intelligent devices, data analytics, applications and services, supported by its Edison intelligence platform. With over 100 years of healthcare industry experience and around 48,000 employees globally, the company operates at the center of an ecosystem working toward precision health, digitizing healthcare, helping drive productivity and improve outcomes for patients, providers, health systems and researchers around the world.Follow us on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram and Insights for the latest news, or visit our website www.gehealthcare.com for more information.1 510(k) cleared in the USA.

Lauder launched The Estée Lauder Companies’ Breast Cancer Campaign (The Campaign) and co-created the Pink Ribbon in 1992, The Campaign’s mission to help create a breast cancer-free world for all has remained steadfast. The Estée Lauder Companies (ELC) has a long-standing commitment to helping women and girls achieve their highest potential. As ELC’s largest corporate social impact program, The Campaign is a cornerstone of ELC’s social investments in women’s advancement and health, uniting people everywhere to positively impact the global breast cancer community. As breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world,1 ELC's continued commitment to improving the lives of all those touched by the disease remains unwavering.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220930005040/en/The Estée Lauder Companies Launches 2022 Breast Cancer Campaign (Graphic: Business Wire)Together, The Estée Lauder Companies’ Breast Cancer Campaign and The Estée Lauder Companies Charitable Foundation (ELCCF) have funded more than $108 million globally for lifesaving research, education and medical services, with more than $86 million funding medical research grants through the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF). Founded in 1993 by Evelyn H. Lauder, BCRF is dedicated to advancing the world’s most promising research. ELC’s commitment to breast cancer research, spanning three decades, has been transformative. In partnership with BCRF, The Campaign has helped fuel research across the entire spectrum of the disease—from tumor biology, lifestyle and genetics, survivorship, treatment, and metastasis—making an indelible mark in the diagnosis, care, and prevention of breast cancer. In addition, The Campaign supports more than 60 organizations worldwide, facilitating real change aligned to the diverse needs of local communities.Story continuesDeaths from breast cancer have declined 42% in the U.S. since the late 1980s.2 However, that progress has not been experienced equally and certain populations are at higher risk for adverse breast cancer outcomes. At every age, Black women in the U.S. are more likely to die from breast cancer than any other race or ethnic group, and mortality rates remain 41% higher than in white women, despite lower incidence.3 The Campaign has and continues to support BCRF-funded research that identifies and addresses disparities that exist across the entire breast cancer landscape. ELCCF’s $15 million donation over five years will fund a new BCRF research initiative to accelerate The Campaign’s goal of reducing breast cancer disparities and improving outcomes. This comprehensive study of the intersection of social determinants of health, comorbidities, and the biology of breast cancer in Black women has the potential to significantly impact breast cancer disparities globally. It will help advance personalized breast cancer health care across prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for those at most risk of dying from the disease, and has the potential to be groundbreaking for the global breast cancer community.William P. Lauder, Executive Chairman of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. shared, ""The potential impact that this BCRF initiative will have in accelerating a crucial area of research cannot be overstated, as we collectively work towards a more equitable future for all. I know my mother, Evelyn Lauder, would be so proud of the advancements we have made through research, education, access to care and our commitment to help end breast cancer.""In the past 30 years globally, The Campaign has:Funded medical research and fellowships, as well as medical resources, services and centers, including access to mammograms and screenings for vulnerable groups with limited access to healthcare.Advanced conversations on the importance of breast health education and early detection by facilitating discussions between the breast cancer community, medical experts and key opinion leaders.Supported therapy and counseling programs to help improve the lives of people with breast cancer and their families.Distributed educational materials and more than 180 million Pink Ribbons to spread awareness.""The Estée Lauder Companies’ success is deeply rooted in living our shared values. Reflecting on the last 30 years, the incredible progress made by The Breast Cancer Campaign has had a lasting impact on our global community. As an authentic cornerstone of our commitments, The Campaign has been supported by our employees, consumers and partners worldwide. Today, it continues to inspire action in people everywhere. As a Beauty Inspired, Values Driven company, we look forward to the future and are committed to advancing positive change for all of those touched by this disease,"" said Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.The Campaign will take the following actions aligned to its mission for its 30th Anniversary:Double-down on The Campaign’s efforts to reduce breast cancer disparities and improve health outcomes.Mobilize ELC’s passionate employees to unite in action and support more than 60 organizations worldwide.Show support through 18 of ELC’s brands: Estée Lauder, Clinique, Lab Series, Origins, La Mer, Bobbi Brown, Aveda, Jo Malone London, Bumble and bumble, Darphin Paris, TOM FORD BEAUTY, Smashbox, AERIN Beauty, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, GLAMGLOW, KILIAN PARIS, Too Faced, and Dr.Jart+.

But at least the stock is up over the last five years. In that time, it is up 40%, which isn't bad, but is below the market return of 52%.While the stock has fallen 5.5% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Procter &amp; Gamble achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 9.8% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 7% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Procter &amp; Gamble has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? Take a more thorough look at Procter &amp; Gamble's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Procter &amp; Gamble, it has a TSR of 60% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Procter &amp; Gamble shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 5.7% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 20%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 10%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 20.7% loss over the past four weeks.The increased optimism can be attributed to recovering industry fundamentals. Also, it stems from investors’ favorable view on the industry amid an anticipation that the Fed could adopt a reverse course of action with respect to interest rates, if economic trends tip into a deep-recession mode in the future.This shopping center real estate investment trust is expected to post quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $0.47 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.4%. Revenues are expected to be $215.08 million, up 1.4% from the year-ago quarter.While FFO and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in FFO estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For Macerich, the consensus FFO per share estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in FFO estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation.

It found more eligible employees utilized retirement plans in 2021 (83.4%) than in 2020 (82.6%). An average of 79.4% of eligible employees made contributions to their plans in 2021, an increase from 77.2% in 2020.""It’s promising to see the recovery of organization contributions in 2021 and the continued increase in retirement plan participation from nonprofit workers,"" said Hattie Greenan, director of research and communications at PSCA. ""This bodes well for the resiliency of retirement plans, and for non-profit organizations and workers as we again face economic uncertainty amid market volatility and inflation.""Additional survey findings showed not only an overall increase in deferral rates, but plan design enhancements as well as increased education and investment support for employees:The average participant deferral rate climbed from 6.2% in 2020 to 6.9% in 2021.Availability to make Roth contributions jumped from 49.5% in 2020 to 58.8% in 2021.The percentage of plans providing immediate eligibility rose for both matching and non-matching contributions by 7% and 20%, respectively.More than half (54.2%) of plans in 2021 offered investment advice, up from 41.6% in 2020.Increasing overall financial literacy (30.3%) moved above increasing participation (28%) as the No. 1 purpose for providing plan education to employeesStory continues""When we look at the results of this year’s survey, we are encouraged by the increased focus among employers on financial literacy for their employees,"" said Kevin Morris, vice president and chief marketing officer, Retirement and Income Solutions at Principal®. ""With our commitment to enabling access to financial security for more people and organizations, we are pleased with this positive progression and increased support.""Even after weathering the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the average employer contribution is now higher than it was three years ago (though not yet at pre-pandemic levels). The survey found the average organization contribution per active participant was $4,887 in 2021 – up from $3,943 in the 2020 plan year.An emerging focus for nonprofits is financial wellness, according to the study. The number of organizations providing financial wellness programs to employees increased to 22.1% in 2021 – up 37% from 2020.

Young people are often underexposed to learning paths, potential jobs, and career paths,1 and lack the diverse skillsets that today's workforce requires. That includes data literacy: Only 21% of 16- to 24-year-old students are considered data literate.Nowhere is that more apparent than technology-focused areas, particularly data science. Roles in that field are expected to grow 22% from 2020 to 20302-a faster-than-average rate-with a base salary of over $120,000.3 But there's a shortage-up to 250,0004 by some estimates-of qualified professionals to meet that demand.So if students need more exposure to careers and data science needs more professionals, what's the solution? DataSetGo, a collaboration between Principal® Foundation and EVERFI, offers a free, first-of-its-kind educational option.Data skills for studentsEVERFI supplies digital educational programming, and the DataSetGo program includes two data science and financial literacy components geared toward high schoolers. The first, Data Science Foundations, consists of four modules that can be completed in approximately two hours. Those include an explanation of the basics of data science and simple skill building, from collecting and analyzing to reporting on data.The second part, Data Science Exploration: Financial Wellness, ties data science as a field to its practical application in financial services careers through interactive simulations in a 30-minute exercise. ""Our goal is to empower students with education that provides a powerful pairing between financial literacy and college and career readiness,"" says Jo Christine Miles, Principal Foundation and community relations director.To ensure its relevance, the curriculum was reviewed by volunteer IT subject matter expert in the field. Murugan Nambiar, a program manager at Principal® who focuses on data and analytics, had an opportunity to offer feedback and support to ensure content resonated. ""I've got a set of experiences and background that I thought I could bring to the table, and it seemed like a great opportunity for me to give back to the community,"" Nambiar says.Story continuesThe program in actionDuring his volunteer review, Nambiar found himself impressed by the structure and deliberation of the curriculum. ""It doesn't just expose students to data science and financial services in the abstract-it really applies it in believable scenarios,"" he says.DataSetGo got its first test run during the 2021-2022 school year when 6,000 students in more than 160 schools completed the course. Initial results showed promise: Students doubled assessment scores related to data science skills and processes.The program will reach a wider student base in the 2022-2023 school year, with students in 11 cities- Atlanta; Charlotte, North Carolina; Dallas; Des Moines, Iowa; Folsom, California; Minneapolis; New York City; Raleigh, North Carolina; Seattle; Washington D.C.; and Wilmington, Delaware-participating. The DataSetGo curriculum is free; students over the age of 13 can self-enroll or educators can enroll to offer the modules as part of a classroom curriculum.Learn more about DataSetGo and discover resources from Principal Foundation to help you build the knowledge and skills you need to support your family's financial decisions.1Middle Grades Review, American Progress ""Preparing American Students for the Workforce of the Future"", Harvard Business Review2 Bureau of Labor Statistics3 Indeed4 QuantHubDataSetGo is not an affiliate of any member company of the Principal Financial Group®Principal Financial Group Foundation, Inc.

The water treatment residuals and wastewater treatment biosolids from Illinois American Water’s Champaign, Fisher, Granite City, Peoria, Streator, Jerseyville and Chicago Metro service areas were applied to agricultural fields across the state.Biosolids are primarily organic materials produced during wastewater treatment. Residuals are produced during the water treatment process and are typically alum or lime based. These materials are beneficial for agricultural land.According to Ryan Schuler, water quality &amp; environmental compliance manager, the partnership supports environmental sustainability. He said, ""As the local water and wastewater provider, we know how important it is to protect our precious resources and to reuse what we can. This is why we focus on environmental partnerships and water source protection.""Solids generated from the water or wastewater treatment process are held in basins or drying lagoons. In the fall, after crops have been harvested, the alum residuals, lime residuals or biosolids are land applied. Farmers then plow the field after the application or in the spring to incorporate the residuals into the soil. Alum residuals benefit the farmland by helping with the retention of soil moisture, whereas lime residuals benefit the fields by adjusting pH to optimal levels. Biosolids add nitrogen and phosphorus to the agricultural fields.As a part of the land application program, strict application guidelines are followed to prevent material from entering landfills, decrease farming-related chemical use and adjust pH to further protect natural resources. Illinois American Water works with land application contractors so the residuals are applied to farmland that has undergone required sampling. Also, application isn’t made to sites that are wet, frozen, or near a potable water supply.Story continuesAccording to Schuler, there are several technical requirements, but ""the effort is worth it."" He said, ""Reusing these natural conditioners on farmland is just one of the ways we implement green technology into our operations. It’s the right thing to do and we are thankful to the farmers who partner with us,"" said Schuler.Illinois American Water implements green technology whenever possible. Examples include:- Using solar to help decrease energy use.- Recycling to reduce waste.- Supporting pharmaceutical disposal programs to prevent the flushing of unwanted medications.- Offering environmental grants to support local, community initiatives to protect watersheds.- Partnering with educators to educate young customers.- Educating customers about wise water use.To learn more about Illinois American Water’s environmental efforts, please visit www.illinoisamwater.com.About Illinois American Water – Illinois American Water, a subsidiary of American Water (NYSE: AWK), is the largest investor-owned water utility in the state, providing high-quality and reliable water and wastewater services to approximately 1.3 million people.

The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $2.5 billion, suggesting a 5.4% increase from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. In the last reported quarter, the alcohol behemoth delivered an earnings surprise of 6%. Also, its bottom line beat estimates by 4.4%, on average, over the trailing four quarters.Constellation Brands Inc Price and EPS Surprise Constellation Brands Inc Price and EPS SurpriseConstellation Brands Inc price-eps-surprise | Constellation Brands Inc QuoteKey Factors to NoteConstellation Brands is expected to have gained from continued growth in the beer business and robust consumer demand for its portfolio of premium, high-end products in the fiscal second quarter. STZ’s wine &amp; spirits business has been benefiting from its premiumization strategy focused on making investments to fuel growth of its power brands through innovation, capitalizing on priority, consumer trends and product introductions. Strength in high-end Power Brands, including The Prisoner Brand Family, Kim Crawford and Meiomi, have been key growth drivers.Constellation Brands has been significantly gaining from strength in the beer business. Depletion volume growth, stemming from strength in Modelo Especial and Corona Extra, has been aiding the top line. The beer segment has also been witnessing gains from premiumization, driven by growth in traditional beer as well as flavors category, including seltzers, flavored beer, RTD spirits and flavored malt beverages. These are likely to have aided the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.However, softness in the wine &amp; spirits business is expected to have weighed on the fiscal second-quarter performance. The company’s margins have been impacted by increased raw material, transportation, brewery and depreciation costs. Supply-chain challenges and elevated material costs due to higher commodity prices and inflationary headwinds are likely to have been deterrents in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Constellation Brands this season.

PEP looks well-poised for growth in the third quarter of 2022, driven by the resilience and strength of global beverage and convenient food businesses. It expects to benefit from delivering convenience, variety and value proposition to customers through its brands. The company continues to gain from investments in brands, go-to-market systems, supply chains, manufacturing capacity and digital capabilities to build competitive advantages.The company boasts a robust surprise trend. It reported the 16th straight quarter of a sales beat in second-quarter 2022. The company’s revenues and earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year.Net revenues improved 5.2% year over year, benefiting from volume growth and robust price/mix. Unit volume improved 3% and 6% year over year for the convenient food and beverage businesses, respectively. On an organic basis, revenues grew 13% year over year, driven by broad-based growth across categories and geographies. Earnings increased 8.1% year over year. In constant currency, core earnings were up 10% from the year-ago period, backed by the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives.PepsiCo’s shares have rallied 12.1% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 1.6%. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock’s performance also compares favorably against declines of 7.3% for the Consumer Staples sector and 16.4% for the S&amp;P 500. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors to Propel GrowthStrength in the global beverage has been significantly contributing to PepsiCo’s revenue growth in the past few quarters. On a year-over-year basis, organic revenues grew 8% for the beverage business in the second quarter. Gains in the beverage business were driven by market share growth in the liquid refreshment beverage category, with share gains in the carbonated soft drinks, Ready-to-Drink Tea and water categories.In North America, the PBNA segment reported year-over-year organic revenue growth of 9% in the second quarter, backed by investments in innovation, pricing and execution. Many of its key brands performed exceptionally well in the quarter. The company continues to invest in its Zero Sugar products and other functional beverages in the carbonated and non-carbonated categories to offer more choices to consumers.PepsiCo has the competitive advantage of selling both snacks and beverages, which are complementary food categories. On a year-over-year basis, organic revenues grew 17% for the convenient food business in the second quarter. In the second quarter, both Frito-Lay North America (“FLNA”) and Quaker Foods North America (“QFNA”) delivered robust organic revenue growth. The FLNA and QFNA businesses delivered revenue growth of 14% and 18%, respectively, in the second quarter, both on a reported and organic basis.Growth in FLNA was driven by the continued shift of consumers toward simple pleasures that offer value, convenience and variety. The segment’s results were aided by market share growth in both macro-snack and savory snack categories. Revenues for the Quaker business benefited from market share gains in the rice and pasta, lite snacks, ready-to-eat cereal, and snack bar categories as it continued to capitalize on the elevated demand for tasty products that deliver convenience and value.PEP is also positioned to gain from continued focus on driving greater efficiency and effectiveness by driving down costs and plowing back these savings to develop scale and core capabilities. In 2019, the company delivered in excess of $1 billion in productivity savings, keeping it on track with its goal of generating productivity savings of at least $1 billion annually through 2023. The company expects to achieve this productivity goal through savings generated from restructuring actions.The actions are likely to position the company to further simplify, synchronize and automate processes; re-engineer the go-to-market and information systems; simplify the organization; and optimize its manufacturing and supply-chain footprint. As part of the restructuring actions, the company estimates incurring pre-tax charges of $2.5 billion through 2023 (with a cash portion of $1.6 billion). Savings from the productivity and restructuring plans should go a long way in driving the top line and margins.Story continuesConclusionAlthough supply-chain disruptions and inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs remain dragging, we believe that the company’s strong portfolio of beverage and convenient food brands position it to bolster growth in the long run.Other Stocks to ConsiderWe have highlighted some other top-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Coca-Cola KO, Fomento Economico Mexicano FMX and Constellation Brands STZ.Coca-Cola, the Atlanta, GA-based global beverage giant, currently has a Zacks Rank #2.

380,68853e60-0a03-3c46-a4d2-3497ad38c9be,PEP,2022-09-30,5 Stocks With High ROE to Buy as Markets Regain Momentum,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-high-roe-buy-105610536.html,1664448970,STORY,"['AES', 'PEP', 'ACGLP', 'AESC', 'SUZ', 'DDS']","[The U.S. equity markets witnessed a sharp uptrend yesterday that partially reversed the decline of the past few trading sessions and five consecutive days of losses. The decline was triggered by the Fed’s third successive 75 basis point rate hike as it vowed to continue its aggressive stance to curb inflation. The Fed even indicated that it expects to bring the so-called terminal rate to 4.6% from the current range of 3-3.25%. The downslide was further compounded by the British pound hitting a three-decade low against the U.S. dollar as a slew of tax cuts per a new U.K. economic plan rattled the European markets.With the Bank of England indicating that it would temporarily purchase long-term U.K. government pounds to arrest the dwindling currency, the pound has stabilized. The U.S. Treasury yields also retreated from their peak to script a mini turnaround for the domestic stock market. However, investors would await further clarity regarding the future interest rate path and its likely impact on the economy as concerns about recession refuse to abate.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. The AES Corporation AES, PepsiCo, Inc. PEP, Dillard's, Inc. DDS, Suzano S.A. SUZ and Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Story continuesScreening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screen:AES Corporation: Arlington, VA-based AES Corporation, incorporated in 1981, is a global power company. The company’s businesses are spread across four continents in 14 countries.

In addition, all key secondary endpoints were achieved with highly statistically significant results.  Based on these impressive data, Biogen’s partner Eisai plans to file for traditional approval of lecanemab in the United States and submit regulatory applications in the EU and Japan by the end of the first quarter of 2023.The FDA has already accepted Eisai’s biologics license application (BLA) for lecanemab under the accelerated approval pathway and granted Priority Review.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's lofty.Union Pacific certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific peKeen to find out how analysts think Union Pacific's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is Union Pacific's Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as high as Union Pacific's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 22% gain to the company's bottom line. EPS has also lifted 30% in aggregate from three years ago, mostly thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably been satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 12% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.6% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.In light of this, it's understandable that Union Pacific's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Final WordTypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesWe've established that Union Pacific maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Before you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Union Pacific that you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

386,8e0553fe-51d9-3fad-9997-d0ee54e32993,CSCO,2022-09-30,Apple’s Tech Supply Chain Shows Difficulty of Dumping China,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-tech-supply-chain-shows-014350316.html,1664537296,STORY,"['AAPL', 'GS', 'QCOM', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'TSM', 'CSCO']","[(Bloomberg) —Most Read from BloombergMacKenzie Scott Files for Divorce From Science Teacher HusbandMeta to Cut Headcount for First Time, Slash Budgets Across TeamsTop Apple Executive Is Leaving After Making Crude Remarks in TikTok VideoStocks Plummet to 22-Month Low as Fed Hawks Circle: Markets WrapMarjorie Taylor Greene’s Husband Files for Divorce After 27 YearsAmerican companies have had a growing list of reasons to downgrade their ties with China in recent years. Former President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Beijing’s stringent Covid lockdowns. The US-Sino standoff over Taiwan. Political pressure to “friend-shore” supply chains toward nations aligned with Washington.But breaking up, as the adage goes, is hard to do.That conclusion is evident from a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis of Apple Inc., which is trying to reduce its dependence on China. The Cupertino, California-based company already started producing some iPhone 14 models in India, in an earlier than usual move for new models. And Apple’s largest supplier, Foxconn Technology Group, recently agreed to a $300 million expansion of its production facilities in Vietnam.Read BI’s Report: Untangling US-China Technology Supply Chain Hard, Not ImpossibleBut Bloomberg Intelligence estimates it would take about eight years to move just 10% of Apple’s production capacity out of China, where roughly 98% of the company’s iPhones have been made. Scores of local component suppliers — not to mention modern and efficient transport, communication and electricity supplies — make it particularly difficult to get out of the world’s second-largest economy.“With China accounting for 70% of global smartphone manufacturing and leading Chinese vendors accounting for nearly half of global shipments, the region has a well-developed supply chain, which will be tough to replicate — and one Apple could lose access to if it moves,” BI’s report from analysts Steven Tseng and Woo Jin Ho said.An Apple spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.Story continuesIt’s one thing to look outside China for other makers of toys and t-shirts. But US technology firms invested more than two decades, and tens of billions of dollars, setting up complex production chains to provide essential goods for the e-commerce boom. Unwinding those ties could end up taking just as long, and may result in lasting damage to an already battered global economy.Of course, unanticipated events — like Europe and America’s rupture with Russia — provide a potent reminder of both the systemic risks of deep economic integration and the speed at which decoupling can occur.Political headwinds in the US have been steadily leaning against US-Chinese integration. Under President Joe Biden, the $615 billion US-China trade relationship has simmered into a cold war following the commercial tensions under Trump that resulted in tariffs on a collective $360 billion worth of bilateral goods, along with US sanctions on key Chinese technology manufacturers like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.The pandemic then ushered in President Xi Jinping’s strict virus-containment policies, which essentially barred travel and has left major areas locked down for extended periods of time. Rising tensions over US ties with Taiwan and China’s unprecedented scale of military exercises in the Taiwan Strait have become the latest flashpoint offering a case for decoupling.“There was some momentum in this direction as a consequence of the trade war and the pandemic,” Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said about decoupling. “The Shanghai lockdown was really a monster accelerant. And the cross-strait crisis in early August added more fuel to the fire.”Yet the Biden administration’s reshoring strategy — or “friend-shoring” as termed by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen — remains a lofty but unfulfilled ambition, as far as the data go.US firms had $90 billion directly invested in China at the end of 2020, and despite all the talk of decoupling, added another $2.5 billion in 2021, according to data compiled by China’s commerce ministry. The actual total is likely even higher, because some businesses are thought by analysts to route some investments through Hong Kong, or via tax havens like the Cayman and Virgin Islands.US tech supply chains in China rely on firms from Taiwan and elsewhere as well as domestic Chinese firms, increasing the level of dependence further.Apple CEO Tim Cook stands outside of the Apple Fifth Avenue store for the release of the Apple iPhone 14, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)Friendshoring ReticenceFurthermore, America’s allies aren’t exactly swayed by Yellen’s “friend-shoring” concept. Key US partners like Singapore warned the Biden administration that isolating China could destabilize the global economy and potentially “sleepwalk” the world’s largest economies into a dangerous conflict.“Such actions shut off avenues for regional growth and cooperation, deepen divisions between countries and may precipitate the very conflicts that we all hope to avoid,” Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said following Biden’s visit to the region in May.That’s not to say untangling the tech supply chains that link the US with China isn’t already happening to some extent. A Sept. 23 report from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. found that the share of US tech imports coming directly from China has declined by 10 percentage points since 2017, “mainly on moderating China mobile phone exports.”Apple’s exposure to China is also notably bigger than many others. Amazon.com Inc., HP Inc., Microsoft Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc. also depend on China to produce hardware for servers, storage and networking products, but the extent of their dependence is far below that of Apple.Bloomberg Intelligence says that overall tech-industry dependence could be reduced by 20%-40% “in most cases” by 2030. For hardware and electronic manufacturers, they could reduce their reliance on the Chinese market to 20%-30% over the next decade, BI calculates.The Biden administration is taking a two-pronged approach to weakening economic ties with China that simultaneously incentivizes companies to shift their production via subsidies and penalizes investment in China via tariffs and export controls.This summer, Biden signed two pieces of legislation — the Chips and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act — that contain provisions to help bolster domestic manufacturing of certain strategic goods like semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries and pharmaceuticals.The legislation bars companies that access the program’s $52.7 billion in federal funding from materially expanding production of chips more advanced than 28-nanometers in China — or a country of concern like Russia — for 10 years.Also this year, the US administration expanded curbs on sending US semiconductors to China, with new license requirements to sell chip-making equipment to factories that produce 14-nanometer or more advanced chips.US industry officials are developing contingency plans in anticipation of more barriers to US-China trade and expect the Biden administration to trigger a slate of additional export restrictions sometime this fall.While there’s the potential for a political reset between Biden and Xi on the sidelines of the upcoming Group of 20 leaders summit in Bali, expectations for a grand détente remain low.“I don’t see any breakthroughs coming out of the Xi-Biden meeting,” said Wendy Cutler, a former US trade negotiator and vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute.Meanwhile, private-sector sentiment has also deteriorated.A recent survey from the US-China Business Council found that US firms’ optimism about China has already fallen to a record low and evolving challenges — like China’s Covid Zero policy, power cuts and geopolitical tensions — have caused more than half of surveyed companies to delay or cancel planned investments in China.Nearly a quarter of the survey respondents said they’ve moved segments of their supply chains out of China over the past year.US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said at an event Thursday that even some companies that have been manufacturing in China for decades — for which it would be “very disruptive” to depart the country — are putting plans in place, citing conversations she’s had with chief executives.But it’s not exactly an exodus from China. A common approach has become “China Plus One” — whereby China remains a core production base, and any additional capacity is added in South and Southeast Asian nations like India, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.Last year, US firms pledged to invest about $740 million in Vietnam, the most since 2017 and more than double the amount in 2020.Taiwan itself remains a vital but vulnerable component of US supply chains. Led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., the island currently manufactures more than 90% of the world’s most advanced chips used for military and corporate computing services. Apple, MediaTek and Qualcomm, which control more than 85% of the global handset chip market, all rely on TSMC’s supply.Taiwan is expected to remain the key manufacturing hub for cutting-edge chips over the next five years, according to the Bloomberg Intelligence report.China’s booming market also underscores the opportunity cost for US suppliers. Some 19 of the world’s 20 fastest-growing chip industry firms over the past four quarters, on average, are based in China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.(Updates with comment from US Commerce secretary in second paragraph after ‘China Headaches’ chart.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Unstoppable Dollar Is Wreaking Havoc Everywhere But AmericaJay Powell Needs Investors to Lose MoneyTwitter Is in This Mess Because Jack Dorsey Was Too Busy Being a Bitcoin InfluencerGoogle’s Low-Tech Plan to Solve the Opioid CrisisAs Home Prices Surge, Americans Are Moving to Cheaper Places©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Although, it's not wise to simply ignore the P/E without explanation as investors may be disregarding a distinct opportunity or a costly mistake.There hasn't been much to differentiate Cisco Systems' and the market's earnings growth lately. It seems that many are expecting the mediocre earnings performance to persist, which has held the P/E back. If this is the case, then at least existing shareholders won't be losing sleep over the current share price. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems peKeen to find out how analysts think Cisco Systems' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The P/E?The only time you'd be comfortable seeing a P/E like Cisco Systems' is when the company's growth is tracking the market closely.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a decent 13% gain to the company's bottom line. EPS has also lifted 9.3% in aggregate from three years ago, partly thanks to the last 12 months of growth. So we can start by confirming that the company has actually done a good job of growing earnings over that time.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 7.0% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.6% per year, which is noticeably more attractive.With this information, we find it interesting that Cisco Systems is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly limited growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Maintaining these prices will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the shares eventually.The Bottom Line On Cisco Systems' P/EWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesOur examination of Cisco Systems' analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the moderate P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.Many other vital risk factors can be found on the company's balance sheet. Take a look at our free balance sheet analysis for Cisco Systems with six simple checks on some of these key factors.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.
