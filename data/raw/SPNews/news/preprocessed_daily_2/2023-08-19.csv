You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read Goldman Sachs Dividend Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.Investors love dividend stocks because they are reliable and often a refuge during tough times when the economy and markets are wavering. More importantly, dividends have a strong history of keeping up with inflation. In the US, companies that provide dividends usually perform better during times of high inflation and increasing interest rates compared to non-dividend payers. Additionally, they're often seen as safer choices, declining less than the overall market during downturns. This defensive quality is especially significant in the current unpredictable circumstances. Since 1926, dividends have represented nearly one-third of the stock market’s overall returns.Dividend stocks experienced a slight drop this year as other asset classes began to catch the interest of investors. This doesn't mean that dividend stocks have lost their appeal, as their demand remains steady regardless of the economic situation. In one of our previous articles on dividend investing we cited data from Fidelity Investments, which mentioned that dividends made over half of the market's gains in high inflationary periods. The study also highlighted specific periods, like the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, where dividends accounted for 67%, 44%, and 73% of market gains, respectively. These decades saw inflation averaging above 5%, and overall returns were less than 10%.Also read: Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 12 Stock PicksEarlier this year, David Kostin, a Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist, gave an optimistic view regarding dividend stocks. He expects a 5% increase in dividend payments from S&amp;P 500 companies this year, with the potential for further growth. Here are some comments from the analyst:""We expect that S&amp;P 500 DPS [dividend-per-share] will reach $70 in 2023 and $73 (+4%) in 2024. Recent company actions also point to a healthy dividend growth environment. The difference in outlooks for dividend and buyback growth suggests firms focusing on dividends will continue to outperform buyback stocks.""Story continuesHe further mentioned that investors often consider companies that have long dividend growth histories because such companies are often financially sound, with the ability to generate sustained profits. By continuously boosting dividends, these companies prioritize providing returns to their shareholders, appealing to those seeking stable income and potential capital appreciation.In this article, we will discuss the top dividend stocks in Goldman Sachs's portfolio. Some of them include NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and S&amp;P Global Inc.

But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC), since the last five years saw the share price fall 36%.Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn. Check out our latest analysis for Western Digital Because Western Digital made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.In the last five years Western Digital saw its revenue shrink by 3.7% per year. While far from catastrophic that is not good. The share price decline at a rate of 6% per year is disappointing. But it doesn't surprise given the falling revenue. Without profits, its hard to see how shareholders win if the revenue keeps falling.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthWestern Digital is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for Western Digital in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?We'd be remiss not to mention the difference between Western Digital's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price return. The TSR attempts to capture the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested) as well as any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings offered to shareholders. Dividends have been really beneficial for Western Digital shareholders, and that cash payout explains why its total shareholder loss of 31%, over the last 5 years, isn't as bad as the share price return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Western Digital had a tough year, with a total loss of 17%, against a market gain of about 1.9%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 6% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Western Digital better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  Western Digital is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is a bit unpleasant...If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

6,5aa0ce5d-311f-4f59-9823-ab2ad03c0aa8,NUE,2023-08-19,Buyout offers knock on US Steel's door as 'glory days' fade,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buyout-offers-knock-on-us-steels-door-as-glory-days-fade-164446823.html,1692377086,STORY,"['X', 'STLD', 'CLF', 'NUE']","[One of the US economy's most revered manufacturing names could soon be absorbed by the industry.US Steel (X) this week revealed the company is evaluating ""strategic alternatives"" after receiving ""multiple unsolicited offers,"" including a $7.3 billion bid from peer Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF), which it rejected.US Steel also received a bid from privately-held Esmark worth $7.8 billion with European giant ArcelorMittal (MT) is also reportedly interested in the company, a deal which would mark a re-entry to the US market after ArcelorMittal sold its US assets to Cleveland-Cliffs in 2020.Following Cleveland-Cliffs' offer, US Steel stock rose more than 35% bringing its year-to-date gains to just shy of 25%. Cleveland-Cliffs shares are down about 7% this year, in-line with the drop seen in US Steel shares prior to its bid for the company.The bids also come with steel prices more than 50% off their pandemic highs.""We've just seen the glory days happen,"" said Josh Spoores, steel analyst at CRU Group. ""It was two years after the pandemic lockdowns happened where [steel companies] made an incredible amount of money. We're trending back down towards more normalized levels now.""US Steel's annual revenue grew from $12.93 billion in 2019 to $21.06 billion in 2022, when the the price of the underlying commodity reached a record of almost $2000 per ton during the pandemic.This year, analysts expect sales to decline about 15% in 2023 and 13% in 2024, with adjusted earnings falling 61% and 50% respectively, according to Bloomberg data. Total steel shipments are estimated to grow 1.19% this year, and 4.11% in 2024.A manufacturing 'renaissance'Founded in 1901, the Pittsburgh-based giant has been a player in traditional steel production using blast furnaces. More recently, the company has invested in electric arc furnaces, which provide a cleaner, more cost efficient way to produce steel by recycling scraps.Story continues""They've [US Steel] been investing in some key new facilities. And as they prepare to pay for new equipment in their facilities they've been carrying a lot of cash on their balance sheet,"" Spoores said.""Overall I think they’re in a great position to serve the North American steel market in the decades to come because of what they’re doing,"" he added.Though the US is decades past its peak steel-making days, a tie-up between US Steel and Cleveland Cliffs would rank them as the only American company among the top 10 steelmakers in the world. Domestically, the industry is expected to benefit from the government's multi-year spending initiatives on infrastructure, manufacturing, and green energy developments through the Inflation Reduction Act passed last year.""I'd say the IRA is misnamed,"" US Steel CEO David Burritt said during the company's second quarter earnings call. ""It's a Manufacturing Renaissance Act. We applaud those that made it happen, and we look forward to the tailwinds we believe it will provide for the steel industry for years to come.""One industry analyst called the spending ""an unprecedented perfect storm.""""All of those things could potentially result in a big boon for the steel industry,"" Evan Mann, senior high-yield analyst at Gimme Credit told Yahoo Finance.""I think they're positioning themselves for that. Rightsize the industry. Get rid of the inefficient capacity, so that when demand picks up, you're ensuring that pricing will be better and everybody in the industry will make more money,"" he added.A view of U.S. Steel Edgar Thomson Steel Works, March 10, 2018 in Braddock, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)Regulatory hurdlesIndustry observers also expect that a tie-up between two US steel giants would likely come with regulatory hurdles.An acquisition of US Steel by Cleveland-Cliffs, for instance, would make the combined company the only provider of iron ore used for blast furnace production in the US.""When you have continued consolidation within the supply, my biggest concern is that it will lead to increased supply price pressures that will make it harder for domestic manufacturers to compete,"" said Dale Crawford, executive director at Steel Tube Institute, a non-profit that represents manufacturers of steel tubing used in everything from warehouses to electrical infrastructures.Another regulatory eyebrow raiser could come from the electrical steel market, with this material used for EV parts such as motors and charging infrastructure.Cleveland-Cliffs is the main producer of that material in the US, and US Steel is working on a new line to provide the same product domestically.""I'm so confident in our ability to be not only successful but disruptive to the electrical steel market in the United States,"" Burritt said during the company's last earnings call. US Steel sees the electrical steel market as one of the fastest-growing with margin expansion potential.""Here, again, you have a competitive move — that the other company is just trying to purchase [US Steel] to eliminate,"" said Spoores. ""This would have a very, very challenging time to pass through antitrust investigations. Something would need to be divested, or many things would need to be divested.""An 'unreasonable' offerThough other bidders have reportedly emerged, the central playing in an American steel industry reshuffling — US Steel and Cleveland Cliffs — don't seem particularly close on a framework to get a deal done.US Steel's chief executive Burritt called Cleveland-Cliffs' offer ""unreasonable"" in a letter addressed to its CEO, Lourenco Gonclaves. Cleveland Cliffs, however, is not walking away from the negotiating table.Cleveland-Cliffs now has the industry union on its side, with the the United Steelworkers announcing Thursday Cleveland-Cliffs has the right to bid on its behalf since an acquisition would require the support of USW.""We have no doubt that the extension of our strong partnership with Cliffs to the 11,000 union represented employyes at USS will benefit the employees, their families and the communities in which they operate,"" wrote USW president Thomas Conway in a letter earlier this month. ""A strong and productive U.S. labor force is of utmost importance to our country.""""With this exclusive assignment, Cliffs is the only realistic buyer able to acquire the totality of U.S. Steel,"" the company said in a statement on Thursday.""I'm sure the offers are going to become a little more competitive, more higher valuation before its all said and done,"" Spoores said.Pipes are seen at an abandoned steel blast furnace in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania April 8, 2011.

Also, currency fluctuations continue to dampen top-line growth. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).During the COVID-19 public health emergency, Thermo Fisher’s biosciences and bioproduction businesses have expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements.However, since the past few quarters, Thermo Fisher has been experiencing a continuous decline in COVID testing-related demand. This is expected to decline further in 2023 as customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand declines. Sales of products related to COVID-19 testing in the second quarter of 2023 declined 87.3%. During the first six months of 2023, sales growth in all major regions declined due to decreased demand for COVID-19-related products.Further, Thermo Fisher derives more than 50% of its revenues from the international market, which exposes it to fluctuations in foreign currency. In the past several years, the company’s earnings were affected significantly by foreign exchange headwind.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. PriceThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. PriceThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. price | Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. QuoteThe challenging macroeconomic scenario and slower economic recovery in China hurt Thermo Fisher's growth. The company has been witnessing headwinds in the government and academic markets. Moreover, many countries in Europe are also going through a tough time that might impact their academic budgets. We remain cautious since growth could further moderate if the economic scenario worsens.During the second quarter of 2023, Thermo Fisher registered a year-over-year decline in sales in North America and Asia Pacific.On a positive note, Thermo Fisher is registering growth in most of its end markets. In terms of the pharma and biotech end market, of late, the biosciences and bioproduction businesses have expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as these customers have expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements.Story continuesAdditionally, the pharma services business has provided pharma and biotech customers with the services they need to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. In the second quarter, within the end market, the company registered the strongest growth in the pharma and biotech end market.In academic and government, Thermo Fisher grew in the high single digits in the quarter. The company delivered strong growth in the electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses, as well as research and safety market channel.

(NYSE:TMO) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/90-institutional-ownership-thermo-fisher-130014058.html,1692363614,STORY,['TMO'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Thermo Fisher Scientific's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 25 shareholders own 48% of the companyOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockEvery investor in Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 90% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Thermo Fisher Scientific?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Thermo Fisher Scientific. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Thermo Fisher Scientific's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Thermo Fisher Scientific. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.3% of shares outstanding. With 7.7% and 4.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and Capital Research and Management Company are the second and third largest shareholders.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Thermo Fisher ScientificThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$302m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 10% stake in Thermo Fisher Scientific. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Thermo Fisher Scientific better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Thermo Fisher Scientific  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Shares have lost about 6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is U.S. Bancorp due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.U.S. Bancorp's Q2 Earnings Lag Estimates, Provisions RiseU.S. Bancorp’s second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share (excluding merger and integration-related charges, balance sheet optimization as well as provision for credit losses) of $1.12 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13. Nonetheless, it grew 2.8% from the prior-year quarter.Results were benefited from an increase in NII, supported by higher interest rates. Also, a rise in non-interest income and moderate loan growth were positives. On the flip side, higher expenses and deterioration of the company’s credit quality were headwinds.Net income (GAAP basis) attributable to U.S. Bancorp was $1.36 billion, down 11.1% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues Improve, Expenses RiseTotal net revenues in the quarter under review were $7.14 billion, up 19.4% year over year. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.16 billion.Tax-equivalent NII totaled $4.45 billion, jumping 28.4% from the year-ago quarter. The uptick was primarily driven by rising interest rates on earning assets and MUFG Union Bank acquisition.The net interest margin of 2.9% increased 31 basis points year over year.Non-interest income rose 7% year over year to $2.73 billion. The rise was mainly due to higher card revenues, corporate payment products revenues, trust and investment management fees, commercial products revenues and mortgage banking revenues. This was partially offset by a fall in service charges revenues and net securities gain.Non-interest expenses climbed 22.7% year over year to $4.57 billion. This was due to an increase in all components of expenditures.The efficiency ratio was 63.7%, higher than the year-ago quarter’s 62.1%. A rise in the ratio indicates a deterioration in profitability.Average total loans improved 1% sequentially to $388.82 billion. Average total deposits decreased 2.6% to $497.27 billion.Story continuesCredit Quality WorsensNet charge-offs were $649 million, up from $161 million in the year-ago quarter. Total allowance for credit losses was $7.7 billion, up 23% year over year. The provision for credit losses in the reported quarter was $821 billion compared with $311 million in the prior-year quarter.U.S. Bancorp’s non-performing assets were $1.09 billion compared with $770 million in the second-quarter 2022.Capital Position WeakensThe Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.6% as of Jun 30, 2023, down from 11.4% in the year-earlier quarter. The Tier 1 capital-to-risk-weighted assets ratio was 8.9% as of Jun 30, 2023, down from 9.4%.Common Equity Tier (CET) 1 capital ratio under the Basel III standardized approach was 9.1% as of Jun 30, 2023, down from 9.7% in the year-ago quarter.The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 4.8%, down from the prior-year quarter’s 5.5%.Outlook (Adjusted Basis)Third-Quarter 2023NII (taxable-equivalent basis) is expected in the range of $4.2-$4.4 billion compared with $4.4 billion recorded in the second quarter.Management projects adjusted total revenues to be between $6.9 billion and $7.1 billion compared with $7.2 billion in the second quarter. The outlook includes purchase accounting accretion of approximately $75 million.The company estimates non-interest expenses (excluding merger and integration charges) to be around $4.3 billion compared with $4.3 billion recorded in the second quarter. The guidance includes core deposit intangibles amortization related to Union Bank acquisition of approximately $120 million.It anticipates merger and integration charges to be between $150 million and $200 million.Adjusted income tax rate (tax equivalent basis) is suggested in the range of 23-24%. 2023NII (taxable-equivalent basis) is expected in the range of $17.5-$18 billion.The company anticipates adjusted total revenues to be between $28 billion and $29 billion. This includes purchase accounting accretion of approximately $330 million.Non-interest expenses (excluding merger and integration charges) are estimated to reach around $17 billion. This includes core deposit intangibles amortization related to Union Bank of approximately $500 million.Management projects merger and integration costs to be between $900 million and $1 billion.Adjusted income tax rate (tax equivalent basis) is suggested in the range of 23.2024Management expects CET 1 ratio to reach 8.5-9% by fourth-quarter 2024.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.VGM ScoresCurrently, U.S. Bancorp has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise U.S. Bancorp has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Robust health and wellness businesses and high customer retention levels are boosting the First Aid and Safety Services segment’s performance. Robust demand for products and services is driving the growth of the All-Other business.Cintas' focus on the enhancement of its product portfolio, along with investments in technology and existing facilities, should continue to drive its performance. Also, the company’s focus on operational execution, cost-control measures and pricing actions is helping it maintain healthy margin performance. For instance, in fiscal 2023 (ended May 2023), the gross margin increased 110 basis points to 47.3%.The company’s efforts to reward its shareholders through share repurchases are noteworthy. In fiscal 2023, the company repurchased shares worth $398.87 million and paid dividends of $449.92 million. Owing to strong performance in fiscal 2023, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 17.4% to $1.35 per share in July 2023.

12,5a15e05d-89fb-37b0-a6db-d2bae6c04a85,CTAS,2023-08-19,3 Stocks to Buy Amid the August Market Pullback and Hold,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-buy-amid-august-120000653.html,1692360000,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'CTAS', 'LULU']","[The August downturn has been spurred by a mixture of profit-taking and a recalibration of the inflation outlook. The Fed’s July minutes, coupled with strong retail sales data and more showcase how sturdy the U.S. economy is at the moment. This means that Jay Powell and his peers will likely have to leave their core rate higher for longer to help cool prices and prevent inflation from possibly rebounding.The outlook for rates and inflation is showing up in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields, which have surged to fresh 52-week highs and their highest levels since before the financial crisis.Stocks slipped for the third day in a row on Thursday to send both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq deeper below their 50-day moving averages. The selling certainly isn’t fun in the moment. But the downturn was needed to blow the froth off the top of the massive 2023 rally.The Nasdaq is now near oversold RSI levels for the first time since late December (when the market rally began).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThere could, of course, be more selling in the near term. Yet the Fed is still near the tail end of its tightening efforts and the earnings outlook for 2024 and 2025 remains robust.Let’s dig into three stocks that investors might want to buy now during the August pullback and hold for the long haul.Cintas Corporation (CTAS)Cintas is a titan in the work uniform and business apparel space, currently serving over one million customers across various areas of the economy. The company operates both rental and purchase segments to clients in healthcare, food service, education, hospitality, and beyond. Cintas also runs various other offerings such as facility services like restroom and cleaning supplies, first aid, fire protection services, and much more.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCintas has grown at steady and impressive clips over the last several decades. CTAS sees big upside through both existing clients and its large addressable market. The company grew both its adjusted earnings and revenue by roughly 12% in its fiscal 2023 (period ended May 31), which it reported in the middle of July.Story continuesZacks estimates call for CTAS to post 7% revenue growth both this year and next to reach $10 billion. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to climb around 9% and 10%, respectively. Cintas earnings outlook has trended higher over the last few years and it is up slightly since its last report. CTAS has also topped our quarterly EPS estimates for five years running.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCintas’ strength and stability are further cemented by the fact that it is one of roughly 65 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, which are firms that have both paid and raised dividends for at least 25 straight years. CTAS stock has soared around 900% in the past 10 years to blow away the S&amp;P 500’s 175%, with CTAS up 55% in the last three years and 9% YTD. Cintas is currently trading right around its 50-day moving average and 7% below its average Zacks price target. On the valuation front, Cintas trades 18% below its highs at 33.8X forward 12-month earnings.Lululemon (LULU)Lululemon changed the way millions of people dress as everyone from Nike (NKE) to Target raced to rollout their own athleisure styles for women and men. LULU’s evolution into a well-rounded sportswear and apparel company is on full display today. Lululemon sells a range of clothing fit for the gym, the office, a date night, the golf course, and practically anywhere.Lululemon has its own resale shop that allows users to sell and buy used Lululemon apparel similar to Patagonia and other higher-end brands with very strong brand and customer loyalty. LULU has ventured into other various revenue streams as well.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLululemon’s consistent growth is highly impressive, with it powering through the recent consumer slowdown, driven by higher income shoppers. Lululemon posted 30% revenue growth in its fiscal 2022, 42% sales expansion in FY21, and 16% average revenue growth during the five years prior. LULU also posted 30% adjusted earnings growth in FY22 as it benefits from its customers willing and able to pay $130 for leggings and $90 for shirts.LULU beat our Q1 FY23 earnings and sales estimates in early June and upped its outlook. Zacks estimates call for another stretch of double-digit sales and earnings growth in FY23 and FY24. Plus, Lululemon executives project it will double its net revenue between 2021 and 2026. Lululemon’s upward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. Wall Street remains very high on the stock, with 19 of the 24 brokerage recommendations Zacks has at “Strong Buys.”Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLULU stock has skyrocketed 3,800% over the last 15 years vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 255% and 180% in the last five—vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 55% and Nike’s 32%. Yet investors can buy Lululemon at a possibly attractive long-term entry point, with it trading 20% below its 2021 peaks, chopping around for the last several years. The stock is currently trading above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Plus, Lululemon trades at a nearly 60% discount to its own highs and sightly under its 10-year median at 29.5X 12-month earnings. And it has a sturdy balance sheet.McDonald’s (MCD)McDonald’s is another stock on our list today that makes the exclusive group of S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. The fast-food superpower is thriving with a business that hasn’t changed much in decades by going all in on mobile ordering and delivery, while making the occasional menu tweak. The McDonald’s app was downloaded 127 million times worldwide in 2022, according to Apptopia to blow away Uber Eats’ 60 million, DoorDash’s 42 million, and Starbucks’ 34 million.There are over 40,000 McDonald’s locations across over 100 countries, with roughly 95% owned by franchisees. McDonald’s customers know what they are getting and so does Wall Street.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcDonald’s posted 11% global comps growth in 2022 and 17% in 2021. MCD’s adjusted earnings climbed roughly 9% and 50%, respectively during this same stretch.

The company’s revenue is projected to climb 10% in FY23 and 8% higher in 2024 to reach $27.37 billion, with total 2023 comparable sales growth estimated to hit 9%. McDonald’s positive earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcDonald’s shares have roughly doubled the S&amp;P 500 over the last 25 years, up over 900%, with a total return of roughly 1,700%. MCD is up 75% over the last five years and 20% during the past 24 months vs. the S&amp;P 500’s tiny dip. McDonald’s has popped 7% in 2023, with it down around 6% from its highs. MCD might have to find buyers at its 200-day moving average soon. That said, it is now near oversold RSI levels.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Right now, Integer is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Edwards Lifesciences has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that ITGR's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.ITGR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 20.07, while EW has a forward P/E of 30.15. We also note that ITGR has a PEG ratio of 1.65. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. EW currently has a PEG ratio of 4.15.Another notable valuation metric for ITGR is its P/B ratio of 2. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, EW has a P/B of 7.25.Based on these metrics and many more, ITGR holds a Value grade of B, while EW has a Value grade of D.Story continuesITGR stands above EW thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that ITGR is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That price is 28 cents more than it was a month ago but 19 cents cheaper than a year ago, AAA said.“We appear to be at a fork in the road when it comes to which direction gas prices will take – up or down,” said a AAA spokesperson in the report. “The summer heat that kept people home and suppressed refinery production has eased for now, so we have to look at the cost of oil to determine if the recent price climb is ending. More expensive oil will likely lead to higher prices, so stay tuned.”Walmart's announcement follows the launch last month of Walmart+ Travel, its partnership with Expedia that allows Walmart+ subscribers who book vacations through the site to receive Walmart Cash that can be used at the store for shopping or can be cashed out at the store.How To Save On Streaming Services and Find Streaming Deals13 Reasons to Shop at Walmart (Even If You Hate Walmart)Walmart Shoppers Turn Out To Drive Up Quarterly Results]"

Around the world, our customers and members are prioritizing value and convenience,” he said in a statement announcing the company’s quarterly results. He also said that shoppers are driving Walmart’s e-commerce business, which grew 24% globally, led by pickup and delivery services.“Food is a strength, but we’re also encouraged by our results in general merchandise versus our expectations when we started the quarter,” the executive said.McMillon said that inventory is in ""good shape,"" and that the company likes its position for the rest of the year.For its second quarter ended July 31, Walmart reported sales up 5.7% to $161.6 billion, and adjusted earnings growth of 4% to $1.84 per share. Both of these beat analysts’ expectations and were fueled by U.S. comparable-store sales surging 6.4% as well as margins expanding.As a result of a strong performance in the first half of 2023, Walmart raised its full-year outlook. The retailer said it expects revenue growth of 4% to 4.5% and adjusted earnings per share of $6.36-$6.46, compared with its previous outlook of revenue growth of 3.5% and adjusted earnings per share of $6.10-$6.20.'Resilient' customers“Our customers and members are resilient. They're looking for value, and they trust us to be there for them,” McMillon said on an Aug. 17 conference call to discuss the results. “They're looking for value, and they trust us to be there for them.”At its Sam’s Club U.S. unit, the company reported strong comparable sales, led by food and consumables as well as healthcare. The unit had strong growth overall, it said.Sam’s gained market share in the grocery and general merchandise markets, including apparel, home and toys. The store’s curbside business increased growth in eCommerce. It also saw membership income climb 7%, with continued strength in Plus member growth and renewals, the company said.Meanwhile, Home Depot posted results earlier in the week, underscoring strength in consumer spending, as Kiplinger previously reported.

Thank you for your interest in Walmart. Doug, we are now ready to begin.Doug McMillon: Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. We had another strong quarter. We're gaining share across markets and formats, growing units sold, transaction counts are positive across markets and growth in operating income is outpacing sales. We're really pleased with our first half performance. For the quarter, comp sales for Walmart U.S. were ahead of where we thought they'd be at 6.4%. Sam's Club U.S. was 5.5% and sales for international were up 11%, led by double-digit growth at Walmex and China. Flipkart's GMV was also strong. The team is driving results in the short-term and building for the future. We're a people-led, tech-powered, omnichannel retailer dedicated to helping people save money and live better.Story continuesWe like who we are and we like who we are becoming. We're positioned for growth. We can serve people how they want to be served whether that's in a store club, picking up an order curbside or having it delivered. We continue to grow some of our newer businesses which shape the overall model in a positive way, helping to enable us to grow profit faster than sales. We're setting the right capital priorities, and you can expect us to continue investing in the areas we've talked about, like technology, including automation, store and club remodels, and with new stores and clubs in select markets. As it relates to technology, our approach to new tools like generative AI is to focus on making shopping easier and more convenient for our customers and members and helping our associates enjoy more satisfying and productive work.Ultimately, the power of generative AI or any technology is only as good as the data that powers it. Our data assets are unique, and we're excited about the potential to leverage them in new and impactful ways. We're taking large language models developed by our partners and by the broader tech community and adding retail context to create models that are uniquely suited to the needs of our customers, our associates and our supply chain. We'll unlock value for shareholders through the combination of our physical automation work with our data and increasingly intelligent software. We have a sharp focus on ROI as we drive results and set our capital priorities. The financial framework we laid out at our Investment Community Meeting in April is evident in our results from the last two quarters.The remodel program I mentioned includes items to support our goal of becoming a regenerative company, as we put things like new refrigeration equipment and EV charging stations in place. I was in Chile last week where I got to participate in the grand opening of a new hydrogen plant in Santiago that supports our strong business in that country. While I'm on the subject of regeneration, we recently announced a new collaboration focused on supporting U.S. and Canadian farmers to help improve soil health and water quality. Our collective goal is to enable and accelerate the adoption of regenerative agricultural practices on more than 2 million acres of farmland and deliver 4 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission reductions and removals by 2030.Some days I still get amazed by all the good work happening across our company. As a global retailer, we see how our customers and members are affected by what's happening at a macro level, and how that influences their behaviors. Jobs, wages and pockets of disinflation are helping our customers, but rising energy prices, resuming student loan payments, higher borrowing costs, and tightening lending standards and a drawdown in excess savings mean that household budgets are still under pressure. I was in Calgary visiting stores a couple of weeks ago, and our Canadian customers are feeling the pinch of higher interest rates faster than in the U.S. given their shorter-term mortgages. When you put all this together, we see families that are discerning about what they're spending on.They're setting priorities and spending on the things they care most about. We saw that during the first half of the year with Chinese New Year and Easter, and more recently with July 4th and the start of Back to School, where sales are ahead of plan so far. We see them buying more private brand items, and they're buying more grocery staples and in-home meal options consistent with eating at home. Our customers and members are resilient. They're looking for value, and they trust us to be there for them. We see people across income cohorts come to us more frequently looking to save money on everyday needs. That gives us an opportunity to drive conversion in more discretionary categories. We're encouraged by how general merchandise performed during the second quarter versus our expectations.We still expect food, consumables and health and wellness, primarily due to the popularity of some GLP-1 drugs to grow as a percent to total in the back half. But the trends we see in general merchandise sales make us feel more optimistic about those categories in the back half of the year. Our stores and clubs give us a competitive advantage and power our omnichannel model. Our curbside pickup business continues to grow as people look for ways to save time, and store-fulfilled delivery is now growing faster than pickup across all three segments. Delivery speed and accuracy are obviously important, and we lack how we're leveraging our physical assets. In the U.S., we have more than 4,000 stores and nearly 600 Sam's Clubs making same-day deliveries, and in nearly 2,000 stores and clubs internationally.We're increasingly measuring those deliveries in hours rather than days. In China, where we deliver from all our stores, nearly 80% of digital orders are delivered in under one hour. I like how we're constantly improving delivery speed. It's important to our customers and to our strategy, and I like how we're building mutually reinforcing businesses. Running great stores and scaling e-commerce are and will be our top priorities. The way we design them along with our marketplace, fulfillment services and advertising business is key. We'll keep prioritizing omni-retail, but we have good opportunities in healthcare and financial services in multiple markets. The growth of PhonePe has been fantastic, and we're building other financial products like Cashi in Mexico and through ONE here in the U.S. We continue to build our healthcare services capabilities with clinic expansion.As I look at the remainder of the year, our immediate focus is on getting product costs and retails down to fight inflation, which will help with mix, improving execution of pickup and delivery orders, expense management and inventory management by item and category. I'll wrap up by saying a big thank you to our associates. As always, they're making a difference every day for our customers and members. As we close out Back-to-school and get ready for the holidays, their execution day-to-day and commitment to our customers and members is as critical as ever. Thank you for your interest in our company. Over to you, John David.John David Rainey: Thanks, Doug. I'd like to start by thanking our customers, associates and partners for helping us deliver another strong quarter with better-than-expected results in sales, operating income and adjusted EPS. Sales were strong across all segments, and we gained U.S. market share in grocery in both units and dollars, while delivering gross margin rate expansion. Our focus on saving customers' time and money continues to resonate, especially in high volume seasonal periods. We have good momentum in the business. Year-to-date, we grew sales by over 6.5%, adjusted operating income by about 12%, and adjusted EPS by roughly 8%. With our Q2 results coming in better than expected, we're increasing our full-year guidance, and we're well positioned as we enter the back half.I'll discuss guidance shortly, but first I'd like to review highlights of our Q2 results using our financial framework of growth, margins and returns. Starting with growth. For the second quarter, constant currency sales increased 5.5%, or more than $8 billion. Walmart U.S. comp sales excluding fuel increased 6.4%, with growth in both store and digital transactions. Grocery, and health and wellness sales continued to outperform, and we are encouraged by the modest sequential improvement in general merchandise. E-commerce sales were up 24%, driven by store fulfilled pickup and delivery and advertising. We like the trends we're seeing in e-commerce. Customers are increasingly counting on us for convenience, and they're visiting our app and sites more often.In Q2, weekly active digital users grew more than 20%. Similar to Q1, consumer spending remains resilient at the headline level. Customers are stretching their dollars further and seeking better value across more categories more often. We see grocery staples and in-home meal options being purchased more often. Sales of general merchandise kitchen tools like hand blenders and stand mixers have inflected higher as customers are preparing more food at home. They're also buying more necessities and focusing on lower-priced items and brands, and customers still want to celebrate key moments. Over the last year here in the U.S., we've partnered with suppliers to utilize rollbacks and offer select seasonal baskets of goods at the same prices as last year, essentially removing the impact of inflation.Niloo / Shutterstock.comCustomer response has been strong, and sales have exceeded plan for events like Memorial Day, 4 July and our Walmart Plus Week Savings event. We're taking a similar inflation-fighting approach to Back-to-school, with a basket of 14 of the most popular classroom essentials for under $13. In our international segment, sales were strong, up 11% on a constant currency basis, led by double-digit growth in Walmex, China and Flipkart. E-commerce grew 26%, and we experienced positive store traffic across markets. Similar to the U.S., customers are still pressured by elevated inflation with spend over indexing towards food and consumables. We're seeing higher private brand penetration across markets as customers globally look for a combination of value and quality.And Sam's Club U.S. comp sales excluding fuel increased more than 5% with member fee income up 7%. On margins, consolidated gross margins increased 50 basis points as we lapped last year's elevated levels of inventory markdowns and supply chain costs. These tailwinds were partially offset by ongoing category mix pressure, as grocery and health and wellness sales outperformed general merchandise. One of our strategic priorities is improving digital margins with an eye towards e-commerce profitability. I'm pleased with the progress we are making, particularly in Walmart U.S. contribution profit, which has been driven by fulfillment efficiencies and better product margins. We're leveraging our stores to fulfill more than 50% of digital orders, and activating our local delivery networks to get product to customers faster at lower cost.At our Investment Community Meeting in April, I said that we expected 200 basis points of improvement in contribution profit this year, and we're on track to achieve that goal. We're also pleased with performance of our higher margin growth initiatives that reinforce our core omni retail model. I'll provide highlights on each of these. First, marketplace. We're continuing to scale our marketplace in the U.S. with new items and sellers. The number of customers buying items on our marketplace increased 14% in Q2. Sales were strong in both consumables and general merchandise categories, with double-digit growth across home, apparel and hardlines, and the number of sellers utilizing our fulfillment services increased more than 50%. In Mexico, we also expanded the number of sellers and items available on the marketplace, resulting in 40% GMV growth for the quarter.In Canada, we opened our first automated e-commerce fulfillment center in Alberta, which includes Walmart Fulfillment Services and expands two-day shipping to 97% of households. And in India, Flipkart's Myntra is the country's largest e-commerce marketplace for fashion and lifestyle products, offering top brands to customers across India. Myntra now provides access to more than 6,000 brands on its marketplace. Moving to advertising. Our global advertising business delivered strong growth of approximately 35%. In the U.S., Walmart Connect sales increased 36% in Q2, and the business has nearly doubled in size over the past two years. We're seeing strong growth in sponsored ads and increased demand for in-store activation. Advertiser count grew 60%, with strong momentum in new advertisers.Sam's advertising business grew 33%. The in-club sales attribution feature for search and sponsored ads has generated strong interest from advertisers. On average, advertisers are seeing a nearly 30% improvement on the returns of digital ad spend as they gain full visibility to the member journey from intent to purchase, both online and in-clubs. And in international, the advertising business grew nearly 40%. And lastly, membership, Sam's Club U.S. member counts increased mid-single digits with strong plus membership growth in renewals as plus penetration is up 1.3 percentage points versus last year. During the quarter, we achieved record member acquisition tied to Walmart Plus Week and continued to enhance the value of the Walmart Plus membership.We introduced Walmart Plus Assist, which provides a 50% discount off the regular membership fee for customers receiving government assistance. We also partnered with Expedia Group to launch new travel benefits for members. Turning back to the middle of the P&amp;L. As expected, SG&amp;A expenses were higher versus last year and deleveraged 33 basis points. This reflects higher variable pay expenses relative to last year when we were below our planned performance, tech investments and increased store remodel cost in the U.S. Partially offsetting this, international expenses leveraged significantly on strong sales growth. As we increasingly utilize technology in our business, we're pleased with the performance metrics from our newly automated distribution and fulfillment notes.Our automated e-commerce fulfillment centers are achieving efficiencies of 30% higher units per hour than non-automated buildings. We're also seeing increased productivity from the more than 15% of stores now being served by automated regional distribution centers. It's early in the rollout process, but we are encouraged that some of these facilities are driving operating leverage well beyond our initial expectations. Second quarter adjusted operating income grew more than 8%, and our adjusted EPS of $1.84 was up 4%. Our plan is to grow operating income faster than sales, and our second quarter performance achieved this despite lapping the $173 million insurance settlement that benefited international's other income last year. Similar to Q1, below-the-line items were pressured by higher net interest expense, reflecting the increase in rates and noncontrolling interest due in part to stronger results from Walmex.The team continued to do a good job managing inventory, and we ended the quarter down 5%, including an 8% decline in Walmart U.S. We feel good about the progress we've made on in-stock levels as supply chain is normalized and the composition of our inventory mix is improved. We're maintaining discipline in how we're buying general merchandise during this uncertain macro environment to mitigate future risk if demand softens. ROI or return on investment, declined 100 basis points. As a reminder, we calculate ROI on a trailing 12-month basis, and the decline in Q2 is a result of nearly $4.2 billion in charges we incurred in Q3 and Q4 last year, related primarily to the opioid legal settlement framework and the separation of Flipkart and PhonePe. Together, these negatively impacted second quarter ROI by 140 basis points.As we lap these discrete charges in the coming quarters, we expect a stronger ROI inflection in the back half of the year. We're also starting to realize some benefits from productivity initiatives that were initially planned for fiscal year '25, and we continue to expect our ROI to increase over the coming years. I'll now briefly discuss some additional Q2 highlights for each segment. For Walmart U.S., our 6.4% sales comp included a high single-digit increase in grocery and a high-teens increase in health and wellness. Although general merchandise sales declined low single digits versus last year, these results were 300 basis points better than Q1, aided by outperformance from early Back to School shopping in our Walmart Plus savings event.We saw a 240-basis point shift in sales mix from general merchandise to grocery and health and wellness in Q2. Grocery inflation moderated more than 400 basis points from Q1 levels and more than 700 basis points year-over-year to a high single digit increase as we lapped higher levels from last year. On a two-year stack, grocery inflation remained over 20%. We're encouraged by the growth in units sold, particularly in food categories where disinflation is more pronounced, such as fresh meats, seafood and eggs. In addition, private brand sales in grocery were up more than 9%, with penetration up nearly 40 basis points in Q2 and up more than 170 basis points on two-year stack. Lower markdowns and supply chain cost resulted in a gross margin rate increase of 40 basis points, despite ongoing pressure from category mix shifts.The negative impact to margin mix from outsized growth in branded drugs accelerated in Q2. Other income grew nearly 4%, led by continued growth in Walmart+memberships. And overall, Walmart U.S. operating income increased 7.6%. Our international segment delivered another impressive quarter with double-digit sales growth and strong underlying profit growth. Operating income increased 2.2%, but was negatively impacted by 20 percentage points from lapping last year's insurance recovery that I mentioned earlier. Walmex had another strong quarter with sales up 10%, reflecting strength in our Bodega stores, Sam's Club and E-commerce. E-commerce sales grew in the low 20s, with traffic up more than 5%. Walmex is an excellent example of our omnichannel retail strength across formats and channels.Bodega Aurrera is celebrating its 65th anniversary and has become the most valuable retail brand in Mexico. These Bodega stores have consistently delivered strong performance and continue to accelerate e-commerce to better serve customers, now offering more than 60,000 SKUs from 586 stores in 299 cities. In China, sales increased 22%, led by strength from Sam's Club and e-commerce. We're executing well with increased online and offline traffic across both the Sam's and hypermarket formats. In India, Flipkart delivered strong GMV and net sales growth as the core business continues to perform well. The team continues to focus on expanding the ecosystem of products and services like advertising, travel and healthcare, and on delivering continued contribution profit improvement.Flipkart's consistent progress and performance reinforces our confidence in the long-term value of this business. India is leading the largest digital transformation in the world, and Flipkart is the leading marketplace in India, and we continue to be super impressed with PhonePe's strong and consistent performance. Annualized TPV or total payment volume has surpassed $1.15 trillion, and for the first time, we processed more than 5 billion transactions in a single month. Sam's Club delivered another strong quarter with solid unit growth and e-commerce up 18%. It's encouraging to see members embrace omnichannel with strong in-club traffic gains and increasing engagement with our digital tools in and outside the Club. In Q2, utilization of Scan and Go increased 570 basis points, and curbside pickup saw double-digit growth.Similar to Walmart, sales strength at Sam's was led by grocery and healthcare categories as the members focused on value and essentials. While discretionary categories were pressured overall, items with compelling price and quality and strong value to market are driving sales. Sam's Club operating income was up 22%, due in part to lower LIFO charges. Turning to guidance. There continues to be a reasonable level of uncertainty in the economic backdrop for the balance of this year. While inflation has moderated and employment levels have been steady, credit markets have tightened, energy prices are higher, and some customers face additional expense from the resumption of student loan payments in October. As such, we continue to be appropriately measured in our outlook.We're raising our full year guidance to reflect Q2 performance and our expectations for Q3. I'll highlight the key changes, but please refer to the press release for a full list of updated metrics. For the full year, we now expect net sales in constant currency to grow approximately 4% to 4.5%. We now anticipate LIFO will be a $200 million charge to operating income versus the $500 million charge that was in our prior guide. We expect operating income in constant currency to increase approximately 7% to 7.5%. This now assumes a 30 basis point year-over-year tailwind from LIFO compared to our prior guidance, which assumed a 100 basis point headwind. And we estimate adjusted EPS to be in a range of $6.36 to $6.46, including an expected $0.05 impact from LIFO.To bridge to our prior guide, we flowed through the Q2 beat, removed the Walmart U.S. LIFO charges that were previously expected in Q3 and Q4 and modestly raised our sales expectations. Looking at Q3, we're now offering the following view. We expect net sales growth in constant currency of approximately 3%. Operating income growth in constant currency is expected to be approximately 1%. This year-over-year growth is impacted by several comparison factors. We expect ongoing mix pressure impacts to gross margin to continue in Q3. We also expect a negative impact from fuel margins at Sam's Club versus last year's elevated levels. And similar to Q2, variable pay expense is expected to be higher in Q3 versus last year when we were below our planned performance.We don't typically guide currency, but it's worth noting that if rates stayed where they are currently, we'd see a $1.6 billion benefit to Q3 reported sales and reported operating income growth would be closer to 3.5%. And lastly, we expect Q3 adjusted EPS of $1.45 to $1.50. In closing, we're pleased with the strong first half of the year, and we positioned the business favorably for the back half. Our financial performance is validating our omnichannel strategy, driving organic sales growth while improving margins and returns. We're optimistic about our ability to improve our performance even more in the future. We like our position. And now I'll hand it back to [Doug] for a few comments before the operator opens the line for questions.Doug McMillon: Thank you, John, David. Before we take your questions, I want to say a few words about the leadership changes we shared yesterday. Let's start by celebrating Judith. She has done a fantastic job in many roles over the 27 years she's been part of our company. She leaves her most recent role having delivered strong results and having transformed the business. It's a different portfolio, better positioned for the future, it's better positioned for growth on the top and bottom line. She strengthened our culture and sets us up for a digital future at the same time. We're grateful. We talked about Kath moving into the international leadership role. The results Kath and our team have delivered at Sam's speak for themselves.Her experience and passion to serve customers and members will take us to the next level. It will be fun to watch her impact around the world. Some of you met Chris Nicholas and know how capable he is. He joined us five years ago in a finance role but with previous experience in merchandising and operations in several markets around the world. He'll keep our member obsession going in Sam's Club U.S. and pick right off where Kath left off. We also shared yesterday that Kieran Shanahan will join John's team and become our Walmart U.S. Chief Operating Officer. Kieran has 25 years with our company working in a wide variety of roles in all three segments. He is well prepared to lead this big team and the change that's coming through our automation investments in the supply chain.As they build these new roles, John, Kath, Chris and Kieran will have all four worked in all three operating segments of our business. There's not only a lot of store and club expertise in this group, but there's also a great deal of digital and e-commerce experience. These are omnichannel merchants that are purpose-driven proven leadership skills. The depth of leadership in our company is such an advantage, but times get passed and we keep running, keep changing and keep pushing things forward. I want to say congratulations to all of them. And now I'll turn it back over to the operator. We're happy to take your questions.See also 11 Easiest Instruments to Learn for Adults and Retirees and 10 Best Big Name Stocks to Buy Now.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

And as the leadership gap widens and Walmart’s power and influence over the industry grows stronger, competitors have little choice but to join forces.The grocery business is going through a ""revolution,"" and Walmart is ""unstoppable,"" Burt Flickinger, managing director of consulting firm Strategic Resource Group, told Yahoo Finance.This week’s move by Aldi to acquire Winn-Dixie and Harveys comes amid wider consolidation across the sector that has reshaped the grocery landscape. Last October, Kroger (KR) announced its acquisition of Albertsons (ACI) for $24.6 billion, an agreement that will combine two of the largest supermarket operators in the US. The deal will create a grocery chain with nearly 5,000 locations, a move that some experts say is necessary to fend off big box rivals.""Kroger’s acquisition of Albertsons is the last, best, and final chance to level the playing field,"" added Flickinger, who has worked with and covered the grocery industry for more than three decades.Up until the rise of supercenters and supermarkets, most Americans shopped at local or regional grocery stores. Now, the top five grocery chains account for nearly half of the market, and Walmart alone controls nearly a quarter of the overall market share.Growth of supercenters like Walmart, along with club stores like BJ’s (BJ) and Costco (COST), could be the biggest ""long-run story"" in the food and grocery industry, Eric Fruits, senior scholar at the International Center for Law &amp; Economics, told Yahoo Finance. Fruits also highlighted Amazon’s (AMZN) purchase of Whole Foods for $13.7 billion as another deal that further intensified competition within the industry.Story continuesA customer removes her purchases at a Kroger grocery store in Flowood, Miss., Wednesday, June 26, 2019. (Rogelio V. Solis/AP Photo, File) (AP)Consolidation among chains has largely contributed to the recent decline in grocery stores across the country. A report by advocacy group Food &amp; Water Watch found that the number of US grocers fell by roughly 30% from 1993 to 2019, while a study by the US Department of Agriculture showed that from 2005 to 2015 the market share held by independent grocers fell in 41% of the counties across the US.The uptick in M&amp;A activity comes as scale within the industry becomes more important. Larger companies have more leverage than their smaller rivals, giving them more power to negotiate lower prices with suppliers, something that advocacy groups say will put more pressure on smaller grocers and independent businesses.""Our biggest concern is that when you have large consolidation and only a handful of firms touching so many Americans, it makes it all more difficult for the independent segment of the marketplace,"" Chris Jones of the National Grocers Association told Yahoo Finance. ""Consumers are left with higher prices, less choice, and less convenience.""The megadeal between Kroger and Albertsons faces fierce opposition not only from trade associations but from several state officials as well. In a letter to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Wednesday, officials from seven states urged the commission to ""stop this corporate consolidation that is draining Americans of their hard-earned wages and livelihoods.""The California attorney general's office is also investigating whether the merger will create more ""pharmacy deserts"" in the state, in which lower-income areas have limited access to medicines, according to a Reuters report.Food deserts — areas where people have limited options for healthy and affordable foods — are another concern for industry insiders. ""The deal will very likely create food deserts, which we don't need,"" the CEO of a very large supermarket chain told Yahoo Finance.Despite some lawmakers and advocacy groups expressing concern, Flickinger says the Kroger-Albertsons tie-up is ""pro-consumer, pro-worker, pro-supplier, pro-community"" and will ""help stabilize the supermarket sector, which has been in a free fall since Walmart and Costco’s entrance.""In a statement to Yahoo Finance, a Kroger spokesperson wrote, ""The only parties who would benefit if this merger is not completed are large, non-unionized competitors such as Walmart and Amazon.""While hurdles remain for the proposed supermarket merger of Kroger and Albertsons, one thing is clear: Walmart has revolutionized the grocery business through its growing dominance and will likely reshape the industry for decades to come.Seana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

JWN is scheduled to release second-quarter fiscal 2023 numbers on Aug 24, after the closing bell. This fashion specialty retailer is expected to have witnessed revenue and earnings declines in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter earnings is pegged at 45 cents per share, suggesting a decline of 44.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings has moved down by a penny in the past 30 days. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $3.65 billion, indicating a decrease of 10.8% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.In the last reported quarter, the company posted an earnings surprise of 158.3%. Also, it delivered an earnings surprise of 54.1%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Nordstrom, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Nordstrom, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNordstrom, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Nordstrom, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteNordstrom’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 results are expected to reflect the significant impacts of muted customer demand due to the ongoing macroeconomic environment. Reduced consumer spending amid lower income groups, stemming from the tough macroeconomic environment, has been hurting revenues across both banners.Management expects the impacts of the winding down of Canada operations to hurt revenues throughout fiscal 2023. The impacts of the closure are likely to get reflected in the fiscal second-quarter results. Additionally, the elimination of store fulfillment for Nordstrom Rack digital orders is expected to have weighed on the sales performance of the Rack banner.Our model estimates a sales decline of 12.5% for the Nordstrom banner and 11.3% for the Nordstrom Rack segment in the fiscal second quarter.Moreover, the company has been witnessing headwinds related to SG&amp;A expense deleverage due to lower sales. The higher SG&amp;A expense rate is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, hurting the operating margin.We expect the gross margin to contract 110 basis points (bps) year over year to 36.7% in the fiscal second quarter, reflecting an increase in the cost of sales. Our model predicts an adjusted operating margin of 3%, suggesting a 230-bps contraction from the year-ago quarter’s actual.However, the company is committed to enhancing customer experience via its Closer to You strategy, optimized supply chain and better efficiency. These endeavors are expected to have slightly offset demand-related and other headwinds.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management stated that it was focused on enhancing customer experience, improving the Nordstrom Rack performance, increasing inventory productivity and progressing on its supply-chain-optimization initiatives. The company is confident of the strength of its brands, and its ability to drive profitable growth. Gains from the company’s actions are expected to boost its fiscal second-quarter performance.Nordstrom has been making efforts to drive efficiency and improve customer experience via faster order fulfillment. It is also on track to reduce inventory and optimize product mix. Also, increased focus on Nordstrom Rack bodes well. The company has witnessed an improvement in the Nordstrom Rack banner, driven by strategic brand penetration increases.The Nordstrom Rack banner has also been on track to increase productivity throughout its network, reduce transportation costs and delivery times, and enhance services via faster delivery. These efforts are expected to have cushioned Rack’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesWhat Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Nordstrom this time around.

The fast-paced consolidations in this traditionally fragmented industry are expected to benefit Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies MMC, Aon plc AON, Brown and Brown BRO, Erie Indemnity ERIE and Ryan Specialty Holdings, Inc. RYAN.The increasing adoption of technology and higher spending on technology will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Brokerage Insurance industry comprises companies that primarily offer insurance and reinsurance products and services. Insurance brokers act on behalf of their clients and offer advice, keeping in mind clients' interests against brokerage fees. Thus, their business is directly linked with clients’ level of business activity. Some of these companies are also involved in providing risk management, third-party administration and managed healthcare services. Per a report by Allied Market Research, the global insurance brokerage market is projected to rise to $395 billion by 2027 or at an eight-year (2020-2027) CAGR of 7.3%. Research Dive estimates industry players combined to generate $515.3 billion in revenues by 2028, up at an eight-year (2021-2028) CAGR of 5.4%. Increased digitization has been helping to improve operational performance.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Insurance Brokerage IndustryIncreased Demand for Products to Drive Revenues: Industry players are continually expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products, while the rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance. Government initiatives should also add to the upside. The operational results of the industry players are affected directly by clients’ level of business activity, which, in turn, depends on the extent of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve. Also, they must design products that are more appealing to customers.  This apart, better pricing ensures higher commissions for the industry players. Mergers and Acquisitions: The insurance brokerage industry is witnessing fast-paced consolidation. The industry has been traditionally fragmented, with a number of small players. One of the factors driving mergers and acquisitions is the companies’ need to become specialized in their businesses. Some other factors driving M&amp;A are the interest shown by private equity firms in this sector, growing competition and lack of organic growth. Increased Adoption of Technology: To maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others. These players are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate. Accelerated digitalization is also helping in curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. Increased digitization will help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and retention rate. While investments in technology help increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, players must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector.

A Comprehensive AnalysisUnveiling the Risk FactorsInvestors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with MGM Resorts International should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.82. These indicators suggest that MGM Resorts International, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, it's crucial to understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany SnapshotMGM Resorts International is the largest resort operator on the Las Vegas Strip with 35,000 guest rooms and suites, representing about one fourth of all units in the market. The company's Vegas properties include MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, Park MGM, Luxor, New York-New York, and Bellagio. The Strip contributed approximately 74% of total EBITDAR in 2022. MGM also owns U.S. regional assets, which represented 31% of 2022 EBITDAR. MGM's U.S. sports and iGaming operations are currently a high-single-digit percentage of its total revenue.

But, the city and its suburbs remain in areas where the storm could go on Monday if its path changes.Heavy rain, possible flash flooding and winds at 40 miles per hour (64 kph) or stronger are forecast for Los Angeles on Sunday and Monday.The U.S. West Coast is dependent on the region's refineries and imports from Asia and the Middle East for motor fuel supplies.

33,41e90d2d-1b71-33ee-ba42-fe5c8e21bbf7,O,2023-08-19,There’s more coal being shipped by sea than ever before,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/more-coal-being-shipped-sea-213157819.html,1692394317,STORY,"['CL=F', 'NG=F']","[Chinese coal demand is fueling higher volumes at sea. (Photo: Shutterstock/Parilov)Clean, green renewables are on the rise. Coal, the dirtiest fuel, is dying. Or so the energy transition line goes. The reality, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), is that global coal production, consumption, and seaborne volumes are all at all-time highs in 2023.Coal isn’t dying yet globally, just in the West. It’s still alive and kicking in Asia — and still growing globally as a result. That’s bad news for greenhouse gas emissions, but good news for owners of the dry bulk ships that transport coal, particularly as America exports more of its own mining output via long-haul voyages to Asia.“Demand to ship coal has been a good support for the dry bulk market over the first half of the year,” said ship brokerage BRS on Thursday. “Despite coal demand in Europe and North America resuming its downward trend, Asia has provided an offset as demand continues to grow there.”Seaborne coal volumes are predicted to reach 1,335,000 million metric tons this year, topping 2019’s record of 1,331,000 tons, the IEA said in its recently released midyear outlook.BRS estimated that coal shipping demand measured in ton-miles (volume multiplied by distance) rose 9% in January-July versus the same period last year.Record consumption and productionThe IEA estimates that global coal demand will reach 8.39 million tons this year, up slightly from last year’s all-time high. Three out of every 4 tons of coal will be consumed in China, India, and Southeast Asia. China alone is expected to account for 56% of global consumption.“As Europe cuts down on its coal-fired power generation to be in line with its green energy transition, China and India have continued to add further capacity at levels that far exceed the current pace of power plant retirements,” said ship brokerage SSY on Monday.SSY noted that 86% of Chinese coal plants are less than 20 years old, and 52% are 10-20 years old. “Considering that the average lifetime of a coal power plant is 40 years, a full capacity phaseout like the one targeted by Europe is unlikely to be replicated,” said SSY.Story continuesOn the supply front, the IEA expects global coal production to reach a new high this year, topping last year’s record of 8.63 million tons, with China, India and Indonesia accounting for over 70% of the total.According to BRS, rising domestic production in India reduced that country’s coal imports by 7% year-on-year in January to July, to 134 million tons. BRS said the drop mostly affected demand for Indonesian coal aboard Capesize bulkers (vessels with capacity of around 180,000 deadweight tons or DWT).In contrast, this year’s high Chinese domestic production is being complemented by higher imports, a plus for dry bulk shipping.China imported 211.8 million tons of coal in the first seven months of 2023, a 77% surge from the same period last year, said BRS. Indonesia has been China’s biggest seaborne supplier, followed by Russia and Australia.US exports higher share of productionThe U.S. was once the world’s largest coal producer but has fallen down the ranks. Current production is less than half the 2008 peak. Even so, America’s exports are now on the rise. Weaker domestic demand (due to environmental regulations and cheap natural gas) leaves more production to sell overseas.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts that the U.S. will export 90 million tons of coal this year, up 16% versus 2022. Exports are projected to rise further, to 94 million tons, in 2024.The EIA expects 22% of U.S. production to be exported next year. In 2008, when U.S. coal output peaked, only 7% of production was exported.US coal CEOs focus on exportsInternational sales prospects were highlighted by executives of U.S.-listed coal producers on second-quarter conference calls during recent weeks.Paul Lang, CEO of Arch Resources (NYSE: ARCH), said that around 20% of his company’s production is sold in North America, with 80% sold in the seaborne market — half to Asia, the rest to Europe and South America.“What we’ve seen is an ongoing, significantly increased amount going to Asia,” said Lang. “It wasn’t all that long ago that we had minimal volumes going into the Asian market.”According to Deck Slone, Arch Resources’ senior vice president of strategy, “We focus a huge amount of attention on building out that Asian presence. That’s where the growth is going to be.”Lang added: “If we ultimately have to, we’re ready to go 100% exports.”Mitesh Thakkar, CEO of Consol Energy (NYSE: CEIX), said exports accounted for 78% of Consol’s second-quarter recurring revenue. Consol is pursuing “a strategic shift toward export demand growth,” he said.Bob Brathwaite, Consol’s senior vice president of marketing, said, “We’ve shipped cargoes to new end users into India, into China and also into Indonesia.”Joseph Craft, CEO of Alliance Resource Partners (NASDAQ: ARLP), said, “We’re totally focused on the international markets.”According to Jim Grench, CEO of Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU), “We see the seaborne markets as the growth markets in demand, for both metallurgical and thermal coal. As we’ve stated many times — and it hasn’t changed — our focus is on the seaborne markets.”Canal delays positive for shipping ratesMost U.S. coal exports headed to Asia are loaded aboard Panamaxes (bulkers with capacity of 60,000-99,000 DWT) and routed through the Panama Canal.This year, drought conditions in Panama are causing extensive delays and reroutings. These inefficiencies render the U.S. export trend even more positive to Panamax freight rates, because delays and rerouting tie up more vessel capacity.Ship brokerage Braemar reported Tuesday that 80 bulk carriers were waiting to transit the canal, up from 59 at the end of July.Braemar expects bulkers returning from Asia to avoid the Panama Canal and instead go via the Suez Canal or Cape of Good Hope on their ballast (empty) legs. “These longer ballasts should tighten the supply of tonnage in the Atlantic and provide support [to rates] in the coming months, particularly as grain enquiries in the U.S. Gulf pick up going into September.”Canal-related diversions should also extend Panamax bulkers’ laden (full) legs.BRS reported earlier this month that “coal-laden ships out of the Atlantic are deviating from their preferred Panama Canal route due to increasing transit times. Any changes to the fronthaul trade routes will increase voyage days from about 35 days via the Panama Canal to 50 days via the Suez Canal for coal loaded at the U.S. port of Burnside [Louisiana] to discharge in Rizhao, China.”Click for more articles by Greg MillerRelated articles:Container shipping’s Danaos buys into dry bulk amid rate slumpShipping faces fallout as China’s post-COVID rebound falls flatWhat will happen if Russia blocks Black Sea grain ships?Baltic Dry Index has collapsed: Ominous sign for economy?Coal far from dead: Global trade thrives, war reroutes shippingIf coal is dead, then why are ships so full of it?The post There’s more coal being shipped by sea than ever before appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

This initiative is taken in order to reduce the frequency, duration and scope of service interruptions.Penelec is in the fourth year of its five-year program to install 2,000 TripSaver devices throughout its service area. The project is a part of the company’s Long Term Infrastructure Improvement Plan — a $200-million plan to accelerate capital spending through 2024 in order to help maintain ongoing electric service reliability for Penelec’s 585,000 consumers.This year, the company arm is scheduled to install more TripSavers in and around the communities it serves in the region.Benefits of TripSaversTripSavers are installed by utility employees on neighborhood distribution lines that branch off the primary power line supplying a certain region. When there is a temporary issue with the line, such as when a tree limb contacts the line, the TripSaver can detect when the branch is gone and instantly re-energize the line to stop a prolonged outage in the neighborhood.The TripSaver will restrict the outage to that location and reduce the overall number of impacted customers if it discovers a more serious problem, such as a tree that has fallen on a power line. The sophisticated technology instantly locates the electrical fault's position and aids utility staff in comprehending the root of the outage to speed up restoration.Customer-Focused InitiativesTripSavers can allow a company instantly restore service to its customers instead of dispatching a vehicle and team to check the problem, which is especially helpful in Penelec's broad service territory's remote regions. Both the employees and customers will benefit from the safer and more effective service restoration provided by these devices.Reliability engineers look at outage data to find the best locations for TripSavers, particularly distribution lines with large customer counts in tree-filled areas. The new devices replace some older equipment used to isolate damage and limit the number of impacted customers.The company continues to upgrade its infrastructure to efficiently provide services to its customers. In June 2023, Penelec started a large project to help prevent or minimize service interruptions in downtown Johnstown, Cambria County, by strengthening its underground electrical network. For around 900 downtown customers, the work entails rebuilding crucial sections of one of the four main underground cables. It also involves the installation of fresh underground transformers and safety equipment that can quickly identify and isolate damage when issues arise and redirect electricity through nearby lines to stop or reduce the length of power outages.Story continuesInvestment in InfrastructureAlong with FirstEnergy, other electric power companies like Xcel Energy, Inc. XEL, Exelon Corporation EXC and Duke Energy DUK are adopting measures to strengthen their existing infrastructure and provide reliable services to customers.Xcel Energy continues to invest substantially in its utility assets to provide reliable services. It aims to spend $29.5 billion during 2023-2027. These investments are aimed at strengthening and expanding the company’s transmission, distribution, electric generation and renewable projects.XEL’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 6.34%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) implies a year-over-year improvement of 5.4%.Exelon invests substantially in infrastructure projects and plans to invest nearly $31.3 billion during 2023-2026 in regulated utility operations for grid modernization and improvement in resilience of its infrastructure for customers’ benefit.EXC’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS implies a year-over-year improvement of 3.5%.Duke Energy remains focused on expanding its scale of operations and implementing modern technologies at its facilities. It invests heavily in infrastructure and expansion projects. Almost 85% of the company’s planned investment funds its generation fleet transition and grid modernization. This includes approximately $75 billion to modernize and strengthen its transmission and distribution infrastructure.DUK’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.09%.

The company’s healthy margin performance owing to solid operational execution, pricing actions and improving supply chains is encouraging.Let’s delve deeper to unearth the factors that make investing in this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company a smart choice now.Record Booking Levels: Record levels of booking due to strong MRO and aftermarket activity are driving Flowserve's growth. The company’s second-quarter bookings of $1.1 billion marked the sixth consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion bookings. Solid booking levels highlight the strength across the company’s end markets. In the second quarter, bookings increased 20% and 12% in general industries and oil and gas markets, respectively. The same increased in the 2-3% range in power and water.Flowserve expects the uptrend in bookings to continue through 2024, driven by strong MRO and aftermarket activity levels. Solid operational execution, pricing actions and improving supply chains are aiding the company’s margins. In the first six months of 2023, gross margin increased to 30% from 27% in the year-ago period. On a further positive note, FLS expects to achieve run-rate cost savings of $50 million by the end of this year. Cost-control actions are expected to drive the company’s bottom line.Improved Guidance: Following strong second-quarter performance, Flowserve raised its 2023 guidance. The company expects revenues to increase 16-18% year over year in 2023 compared with a 10-12% rise anticipated earlier. Adjusted earnings are estimated to be between $1.85 and $2.00 compared with $1.65-$1.85 anticipated earlier.Expansion Initiatives: Flowserve focuses on acquiring businesses/assets to expand its product offerings. In February 2023, the company inked a deal to acquire Velan Inc. in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $245 million. The buyout will strengthen Flowserve’s valves portfolio and build upon its existing assets through the addition of Velan’s premier brands, strong heritage and technical expertise in diverse end markets. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2023.Velan will become part of Flowserve’s Flow Control Division segment. The company expects to achieve annualized cost synergies of at least $20 million from the acquisition by the end of the first year. The transaction is expected to be accretive to Flowserve’s adjusted earnings in the first year.Rewards to Shareholders: Flowserve is committed to rewarding its shareholders handsomely. In the first half of 2023, the company paid dividends of $52.5 million. In 2022, the company paid out dividends worth $104.5 million to its shareholders.Price Performance: Shares of Flowserve have outperformed its industry in the year-to-date period primarily due to strong booking levels. The stock has gained 22.6% in the period compared with the industry’s rise of 9.1%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNorthbound Estimate Revisions: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Flowserve’s 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 8.8% in the past 60 days.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks within the Industrial Products sector are as follows:A.

41,08fead66-1ca6-36fb-a80f-920eaf7a81b0,RL,2023-08-19,Investors Met With Slowing Returns on Capital At Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-met-slowing-returns-capital-164612673.html,1692377172,STORY,['RL'],"[If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Ralph Lauren is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.14 = US$756m ÷ (US$6.9b - US$1.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).So, Ralph Lauren has an ROCE of 14%.  By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 14%. See our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Ralph Lauren compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For Ralph Lauren Tell Us?Over the past five years, Ralph Lauren's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So don't be surprised if Ralph Lauren doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time. This probably explains why Ralph Lauren is paying out 33% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In summary, Ralph Lauren isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. Additionally, the stock's total return to shareholders over the last five years has been flat, which isn't too surprising. In any case, the stock doesn't have these traits of a multi-bagger discussed above, so if that's what you're looking for, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.On a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for Ralph Lauren   you'll probably want to know about.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Also, China's central bank said that it would employ various monetary policy tools to bolster the property market and wider economy. The development on this front is, thus, backing the commodity price. This, in turn, will probably increase drilling activities in the prolific Bakken shale play. Companies that are well-poised to gain from the above-mentioned scenario are Hess Corporation HES, Marathon Oil Corporation MRO and ConocoPhillips COP.Oil Price to Remain HandsomeThe price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is trading at more than the $75 per barrel mark, representing an extremely favorable price for conducting exploration and production activities. In its latest short-term energy outlook, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) is projecting the average spot price of WTI for 2023 at a handsome $77.79 per barrel.Rising global energy demand amid Saudi Arabia’s extended crude production cut, which is voluntary, is aiding the recent spike in oil prices and will likely continue to back the commodity price.Modest Rise in Bakken Shale Oil ProductionIn September, total oil production from shale resources in the United States will likely decrease by 20,000 barrels per day to 9,415 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/D), per the EIA. The shale resources comprise Anadarko, Appalachia, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Niobrara and Permian.Of all resources, the prolific Bakken shale play and Niobrara will probably witness increased daily oil production next month, per the EIA’s drilling productivity report. In Bakken, the EIA projects oil production to rise 4,000 barrels per day to 1,210 MBbls/D in September.Bakken Explorers in the SpotlightIt is clear that a favorable crude pricing scenario is backing modestly higher production volumes in Bakken. Improving Bakken production amid healthy oil prices has raised the incentive to keep an eye on stocks of companies operating in the prolific basin. We have zeroed in on three stocks that are well-poised to gain. All three companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continues3 Stocks to GainIn the Bakken shale play, Hess has an industry-leading acreage position. With the employment of Lean manufacturing techniques, the company has reduced its well operating costs significantly, while making them considerably more productive. While operating in the Bakken shale play, HES expects to maximize cashflows.Marathon Oil has a clear focus on operating in the prolific oil-rich shale plays in the United States, where the cost of operations is significantly low. Bakken is one of the key plays, wherein Marathon Oil has roughly 240,000 net acres. In Bakken, MRO plans to bring 80-85 wells to sales in 2023.ConocoPhillips’ major business unit is Lower 48, representing the company’s operations in key shale plays in the United States. Those low GHG-intensity assets, where operating costs are low, have huge upside potential.

MSI recently won a prime contract for an undisclosed amount from the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, to provide VB400 body-worn cameras for the safety and security of its police officers. With the deployment of these body-worn cameras in the City of Stendal Police Inspectorate and the police academy in Aschersleben, the government aims to de-escalate potentially dangerous situations with video-documented evidence.The VB400 body-worn cameras are known for their ruggedness and are built to withstand adverse temperature conditions. Designed to capture high-quality video from the wearer’s viewpoint with an intuitive recording function, it delivers transparency with an extended battery life of up to 12 hours of operation. The device can be easily activated by the wearer, combining Bluetooth sensors with peer-assisted recording. In addition to live streaming facilities for enhanced situational awareness, the integration with Bluetooth sensors and beacons facilitates the automated recording functionality.Motorola’s VideoManager evidence management software further helps to seamlessly upload and manage the recorded video. The company will provide round-the-clock technical and maintenance support for an extra layer of operational visibility and enhance transparency and protection for road travelers. The body-worn cameras will enable the police officers to record audio and video events during patrols for effective security surveillance. By virtue of the service level agreement, Motorola will manage all software, hardware, repair and replacement services for the public safety organizations in Germany, thereby eliminating the requirement of any upfront capital investment for this video solution as-a-service by the latter. The local government further intends to roll out these cameras for all operational frontline teams in Saxony-Anhalt to improve efficiency and collaboration across security personnel.Riding on such state-of-the-art products, Motorola expects to record strong demand across video security and services, land mobile radio products and related software while benefiting from a solid foundation. These systems drive the demand for additional device sales and promote software upgrades and infrastructure expansion. The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks related to critical communications operations.Motorola intends to fortify its position in the public safety domain by entering into alliances with other players in the ecosystem.

However, orders declined 15% year over year to $1,244 million.Revenues from Communication Solutions Group (CSG) were $918 million compared with $970 million in the prior-year quarter. A cautious but stable spending environment, particularly in smartphone and PC computing markets owing to inventory adjustments and macroeconomic challenges, dented net sales in this segment. However, strength in aerospace, defense and government induced by solid sales growth in radar system applications, spectrum operations, space, satellite, 5G and 6G research partially offset the declining trends. Increasing investments in non-terrestrial networks, O-RAN, early 6G and AI-ML data center networks were positive factors.The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group (EISG) segment revenues rose to $464 million from $406 million in the prior-year quarter. The 14% year-over-year growth was largely propelled by healthy sales growth in Automotive, semiconductor and general electronics.Region-wise, the company witnessed 1% year-over-year decline in the Americas to $555 million. The downside was caused by lower demand among some larger customers in the region. Revenues from Europe were $244 million, up 17% from the year-ago quarter, driven by strength in automotive with some crucial deal wins.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the performance of the NASDAQ index, head directly to 5 Best NASDAQ ETFs. In the last 15 years, the S&amp;P and Dow Jones indices have shown similar movement about 94% of the time, as monitored by CNBC. The S&amp;P and NASDAQ have also exhibited synchronized movement about 92% of the time during the same period. However, in 2023, the NASDAQ has stood out by delivering a near 30% return. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P has achieved a return of approximately 15%, and the Dow has lagged behind with a modest 5% gain as of August 18. The recent remarkable performance of the NASDAQ can be attributed to the strong rally in tech and communications stocks. The major holdings of the index, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), have all achieved returns greater than 30% in 2023 so far. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) notably stands out with an impressive gain of 218%. However, it's important to note that the flip side is true as well – when investors divest from tech stocks, the impact can be devastating. During the dotcom bubble burst from 2000 to 2002, the NASDAQ experienced a substantial decline of 78%, in contrast to a 49% drop in the S&amp;P 500 and 34% in the Dow.Don't Miss: 10 Best Consumer Staples ETFsThe market capitalization of companies listed on the NASDAQ-100 has increased by close to $5 trillion since the beginning of this year. As indicated by past trends, the strong performance of the NASDAQ-100 so far suggests a positive outlook for the rest of 2023. The market's interest in generative AI has overshadowed potential negative headlines this year, such as recession fears, inflation, Fed rate hikes, geopolitical risks, debt-ceiling concerns, and regional bank failures. Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, told Bloomberg Television: Story continues“I still do like big tech. I do believe in technology continuing to reinvent itself — obviously with the latest addition being AI. That’ll continue to drive earnings.”Similarly, Sundeep Gantori, equity strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management, commented in July 2023: “We don’t believe the AI trend is a bubble, but advise investors to be selective on AI-related stocks after the strong year-to-date rally. From a positioning point of view, we recently closed our self-help theme as we see better risk-reward in mid-cycle industries (software, internet) and tech laggards.”Also Read: 10 Best Industrial ETFsAs per the Nasdaq Index Research Team, most of the 107 tracked indexes displayed positive performance in July 2023, with 87% ending in the month green and the remaining 13% in losses. The average return for all indexes was 3.4%. The NASDAQ-100 index continued its five-month positive streak, gaining 3.8%. The top performer was the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, rising by 11.4%, while the Dorsey Wright Healthcare Technical Leaders Index declined by 4.3%, ranking as the weakest performer. July displayed strength in technology, particularly artificial intelligence, along with US small and mid-cap stocks.In this article, we discuss some of the best performing NASDAQ ETFs.

Results in the last three months were driven by a long-time media position in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), which we consider a durable compounder due to its consistent revenue growth and free cash flow generation. Comcast shares saw a snapback after a difficult first half of the year caused by cord cutting in its cable business and slowing subscriber growth in its broadband business. A flexible balance sheet and strong cash generation enabled the company to repurchase shares during the selloff earlier in the year.”11.

About 45% of that net long exposure is composed of direct and indirect AI beneficiaries trading at reasonable valuations. We have sized up our investments in certain cloud software businesses including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), a clear AI winner as a result of its rapidly growing Azure cloud business, upside from applying AI features to its core Office products, investment in Open AI, and ability to provide AI services to other companies (for example, Microsoft holds a stake in one of our portfolio companies, LSE, which it is also assisting in harnessing greater value in its data via AI).”10.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Dramatic valuation differences across market cap sizes continue. This has been the case for some time now. Perhaps I have spent too much time discussing these dichotomies, as generally, I feel like if we pick the right stocks and manage market exposures thoughtfully, our equities- oriented portfolio will prosper across various market cycles. However, when markets become as lopsided as they have lately, I feel additional discussion on the market environment is worthwhile, if only to help highlight the opportunities that are available and the likely path forward. I expect future discussions to soon be focused again on our moderately concentrated portfolio. But for now, let’s take one last in-depth look at how far reaching these valuation dichotomies have again become.(Please note: charts that accompany the following can be found in the Appendix.)Take Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for example. It is the largest stock by market cap, and fairly considered one of the best companies in the world. The company has been extraordinarily successful and improved standards of living everywhere in the process with their ubiquitous products. Along the way, shareholders have been richly rewarded, with shares increasing nearly fourteen-fold over the last ten years while generating an annualized total shareholder return of 31%, including dividends.On the back of another big quarter for large cap tech, it is now the first stock to surpass the $3T market cap threshold. This makes its weighting in the ~$37T market cap of the S&amp;P 500, ~8%. It also means this one stock’s market cap is larger than that of the entire ~$2.98T market cap of the Russell 2000 index, the first time in history a single stock has outweighed the Russell 2000 – aside from two brief days in September 2020 when Apple’s market cap then accomplished the same…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

We have been gradually trimming our investment to, what we call, an ‘optionality’ size position as the stock price has dramatically gone up. Conditions are chalk and cheese to when we first purchased our investment.Recent news makes us think twice: PyTorch 2.0, the machine learning framework recently announced support for AMD GPUs which is a negative for NVIDIA.For many readers, this may be getting into the weeds but in our May 2021 letter, we discussed one aspect of NVIDIA’s competitive edge – its proprietary CUDA software. Operating as the interface between their GPUs and machine learning (ML) libraries, CUDA has become the standard layer in the AI stack to enable parallelised processing, a critical function for complex neural network models. Competing, cheaper, GPUs with inferior working libraries struggled to gain meaningful traction because the early versions of machine learning libraries (PyTorch and TensorFlow) did not directly interface with them. This created friction for developers and effectively blocked cheaper competitor GPUs from handling machine learning workloads….” (Click here to read the full text)6.

On a fairly regular basis, I bring up former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer's infamous and sweaty ""developers, developers, developers"" speech. It's one of those memes that's perfect for replacing the word developers with any trending term of your choice, and today, the key phrase is obviously A.I.Artificial intelligence is undoubtedly buzzy, bringing back a bit of that perspiration-fueled fervor reminiscent of the dotcom boom era. The frenzy it's stirred up has led to some rather curious deals, such as the case of a fledgling startup, roughly a week old, boasting a valuation of around $100 million, all on the basis of a lofty A.I.-infused vision rather than much of a physical product, as reported by the New York Times.Clearly, many are trying to get a fraction of the action OpenAI scooped up with its whopping $13 billion investment from Microsoft. Entire companies are revamping their business blueprints to embrace the A.I. wave—including my alma mater, Business Insider. While some sectors are playing catch up, companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are throwing elbows for the biggest slice of the pie.For those who rode the wild waves of the dotcom boom, you might be having déjà vu. Only two decades ago, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates was fiercely competing for dominance in the browser wars, pitting Microsoft's Internet Explorer against Netscape's Navigator. Gates, the ultimate strategist, even mapped out a plan for total domination of the buzzy new tech in a 1995 memo to his staff.""In this memo I want to make clear that our focus on the Internet is crucial to every part of our business. The Internet is the most important single development to come along since the IBM PC was introduced in 1981,"" Gates wrote in the 1995 memo, describing the internet as a ""tidal wave"" with profound implications for the future of their business. Fast forward nearly two decades and Microsoft's present-day chief draws a parallel between Gates' gusto and today's artificial intelligence frenzy.Story continues“The Bill memo in 1995, it does feel like that to me,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told Bloomberg's Emily Chang on the latest episode of The Circuit With Emily Chang. “I think it’s as big.”It's funny how history repeats itself. As Bloomberg points out, just as Gates penned that battle cry to his staff as a retort to Netscape (which Microsoft then vanquished, causing an infamous antitrust lawsuit), the birth of OpenAI and Microsoft's guiding touch was goaded, in a way, by Google's looming supremacy over A.I. OpenAI is certainly in the lead now, but it seems to be treading cautiously to avoid retracing Gates' steps from 1995. The firm's CEO, Sam Altman, just went on a world tour asking leaders to regulate the new technology, clearly seeing the potential for similar litigious backlash.The parallels are certainly not lost on Nadella. Yet, he points out to Bloomberg a slight divergence—unlike the internet in 1995, the genuine impact of A.I. is still unknown. I personally won't hold my breath until A.I. unlocks wonders like the '90s and '00s internet did with Neopets and Runescape (kidding, sort of).Here’s what else is going on in tech today.Kylie RobisonWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet?

(AP) — The ex-wife of a Microsoft executive who was gunned down by a triggerman in front of his young daughter has been charged with first-degree murder, and prosecutors in Florida plan to seek the death penalty.A grand jury indicted Shanna Lee Gardner in the ambush-style death of Jared Bridegan, State Attorney Melissa Nelson announced Thursday at a news conference in Jacksonville, Florida. Gardner, 36, was arrested in West Richland, Washington, and will be extradited to Florida to stand trial, Nelson said.“From very, very early on, everything in my body and soul told me she was behind it,” Kristen Bridegan, Jared Bridegan's wife, said during the news conference.Hank Coxe, who represents Gardner, said via email that he does not comment on pending cases.The state is also seeking the death penalty against Gardner's husband, Mario Fernandez Saldana, who was arrested in March and charged in Bridegan's death. His attorney, Jesse Dreicer, said in an email that his client has pleaded not guilty and is presumed innocent. “We are dedicated to his defense and are optimistic that when the all of the facts are made available our client will be exonerated,” he wrote.He was arrested after triggerman Henry Arthur Tenon, 62, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, court records show. He agreed to testify against Fernandez Saldana and Gardner, Nelson said.Nelson did not say what led to Gardner's arrest or mention a motive.“Henry Tenon did not act alone. Mario Fernandez did not plan alone. And Shanna Gardner’s indictment acknowledges her central and key role in the cold, calculated and premeditated murder of Jared Bridegan,” Nelson said.Bridegan, a father of four and a software developer for Microsoft, was ambushed on Feb. 16, 2022, as he was leaving a Jacksonville Beach neighborhood after dropping off twin children he shared with Gardner and returning to his home in nearby St. Augustine.Police said that there was a tire in the dimly lit street and that Bridegan presumably opened his car door to move the tire. That's when he was shot multiple times as his 2-year-old daughter sat in her car seat. She was found unharmed in the car.Story continuesGardner married Fernandez Saldana in 2018 and moved to Washington following media coverage of the case, officials said.After the killing, she told news outlets, including the Florida Times-Union and FirstCoast News, that she wasn't involved in Bridegan's death.A warrant for Gardner's arrest said an investigation into Bridegan's background revealed the couple had a “highly acrimonious divorce” and a “contentious relationship” with both Gardner and Fernandez Saldana.Gardner's parents, Shelli and Sterling Gardner, issued a statement.“Words cannot accurately express the depth of our sadness,"" they said. ""Family is our top priority. We love our daughter and are focused on supporting her and our entire family as we help our grandchildren navigate this difficult and very confusing time. For their sake and all involved, we caution against further speculation and request privacy as the legal process runs its course.""Kristin Bridegan said the arrest ends one chapter.“Shanna’s arrest ends one horrific chapter of our pursuit of justice for Jared and now we open a new one,” she said. “This next chapter will be excruciating. ... We expect justice to be carried out to the fullest extent of the law.”]"

Shares of drug distributors like McKesson (MCK), AmerisourceBergen (ABC), and Cardinal Health (CAH) each fell more than 2%.But analysts say the reality of the announcement is less severe than the market's initial reaction suggested.""Thursday was a unique 'perfect storm' of news that likely had a bigger impact on sentiment than it will in setting precedent,"" wrote UBS analyst Kevin Caliendo in a note, adding the selloff Thursday was ""nonsensical.""The Blues insurer, which is responsible for about 5 million members in California and posts $24 billion in annual revenue, is unbundling its PBM service and doling out portions to disruptors like Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs and Amazon Pharmacy (AMZN).The move, according to Blue Shield, will save $500 million on medications annually— a number CEO Paul Markovich told Yahoo Finance he is confident will be achieved.""We're creating a different mouse trap here. We've done the math,"" Markovich said.Under the new arrangement, Cost Plus Drugs will be responsible for generics and Amazon will take on the mail order business. Puerto Rico-based Abarca Health will manage claims and Prime Therapeutics, a PBM jointly owned by 19 Blues plans which works with partners like Walgreens (WBA) and Cigna's Express Scripts, will handle drug pricing negotiations.The shift will take effect starting in 2024 when Blue Shield's contract with CVS, which has been in place since 2021, ends.However, CVS will maintain the most profitable segment: specialty pharmacy. That, according to analysts, is the reason the announcement isn't all doom and gloom for the Big 3 PBMs — CVS, Cigna, and United Health Group.Story continues""[The] spectre of AMZN will likely negatively impact sentiment for the group, again,"" JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill wrote in a note on Thursday. ""However, we think the announcement actually highlights the value of legacy PBMs and limitations of newer models as Blue Shield is keeping the fastest growing and largest portion of its drug spend with CVS.""Gill noted that generics typically represent only 15% of drug spend even though they represent a higher volume of spend, and specialty drugs continue to rise in cost and represent a pain point for large employers, as seen during the recent demand surge for branded weight loss drugs like Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy and Ozempic, and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Mounjaro.""Per Cost Plus's page, the company has over 1,000 generic medications available but almost no branded drugs. Although the company seeks to add more branded drugs, it appears to be focusing only on specialty drugs that can be delivered via mail order,"" Gill said.In addition, mail order prescriptions have not taken over in-person pickups, despite a surge seen during the pandemic, so there is little concern about Amazon's share of the new arrangement, analysts said.Some are concerned about the customer experience with the complex makeup of PBMs.""Coordinating five vendors is like an average Tuesday for us,"" Markovich said.He added that despite the criticism, Blue Shield is going to be sticking to the unbundled model long-term, even though it is likely the combination of players changes in the future.A sign marks a CVS branch on May 16 in Pasadena, Calif. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File)'Hard to replicate'The announcement from California Blue Shield on Thursday also isn't the first time an insurer has tried such a move.""Health plans have a mixed track record of separating or in-sourcing PBM functions,"" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note Friday. ""This decision by a large health plan will keep scrutiny on PBM economics and attention on proposed legislative changes, though we see the stock reactions as disproportionate relative to the likely implications.""""Historically, the value of scale offered by the Big 3 PBMs has been difficult to replicate,"" the firm added.Craig Garthwaite, a health economist and director of the Program on Healthcare at the Kellogg School at Northwestern University, told Yahoo Finance he's willing to bet the savings California Blue Shield ends up seeing isn't actually $500 million.""There's got to be a belief (by Blue Shield) that there's $500 million per year in excessive, unwarranted profit that the PBM is taking. I just don't believe that's true,"" Garthwaite said.The fact that CVS has been able to keep the profitable specialty pharmacy business also bolsters the unpopular opinion that the Big 3 serve a purpose. Garthwaite said this move runs counter to the idea that ""PBM executives are these monopolous fat cats lighting cigars with hundred dollar bills. It's not that. They actually do things that matter to people.""He also noted that CVS could respond by increasing the cost of the business segment it is keeping in the new contract with Blue Shield.Markovich said anything is possible, but the contracts are in place and renegotiating them could be a breach.The plan has been in the works for more than two years, with a lengthy request for proposal process, which began just before the pandemic, he said.The announcement has excited watchers of health care industry trends, who anticipate other Blues and employer plans could emulate the strategy.""Almost every investor we spoke with felt the consortium hired by Blue Shield was risky at best to be able to execute on the new business,"" UBS's Caliendo wrote. ""We tend to agree, but also understand that this thesis is not likely to be proven anytime soon given timing on onboarding.""We do think the idea that PBM contracting will be increasingly 'unbundled'...perhaps leading to lower overall profits from purchasing, rebates, and couponing.""Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The utility made a temporary fix but learned in March that hundreds more gallons of tritium-laced water had leaked, leading to a dayslong shutdown to fix the pipe.The leaks were contained within the plant's boundaries and did not enter the river, the company has said.Xcel has permanently fixed the source of the leaks, and the plant has returned to normal operations, according to the company's website Thursday. About 80% of the leaked tritium has been recovered as of August.“We will continue recovering impacted groundwater until our monitoring wells indicate the groundwater meets the EPA’s Safe Drinking Water Act standards,” the company's website said.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said water with tritium is safe enough to drink if the amount of tritium is less than 20,000 picocuries per liter.The tritium level was about 5 million picocuries per liter in November in groundwater within the plant's boundaries, the company's website said.As of August, the highest tritium level was 900,000 picocuries per liter — which is not considered safe enough to drink — within the plant's boundaries.Story continuesIn the water adjacent to the Mississippi River, the highest tritium level was 1,000 picocuries per liter, which is safe enough to drink.Leaked tritium still has not been detected in the river, the company's website said.Although the utility and health officials say the leak is not dangerous, the issue has prompted concerns among residents and raised questions about aging pipelines.The nuclear plant, which provides carbon-free energy for the region, is about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Minneapolis.___Trisha Ahmed is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

""That said, you really have to de-average because the amount of turnover in, say, the S&amp;P 500 has remained relatively stable over the last five years, with the exception of 2022, where there was a decrease. In the S&amp;P 500, there was a significant increase throughout 2022 of external CEO hires.""The list of CEOs making their exits has grown massively in just the last week.After an extensive search, PayPal (PYPL) announced that CEO Dan Schulman's successor would be longtime Intuit executive Alex Chriss. Meanwhile, Synopsys (SNPS) revealed a CEO shift this week, as Aart de Geus steps aside at the chip design tools company, making way for Sassine Ghazi to become president and CEO.Kraft Heinz (KHC) CEO Miguel Patricio shocked the Street on Monday when he announced plans to step down. Patricio will be succeeded by insider US CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera. Also last week, coffee chain Dutch Bros (BROS) named Christine Barone, who has served as president of the company since February 2023, to replace Joth Ricci as CEO. Both leadership changes are effective Jan. 1 of next year.And in February, Restaurant Brands International (QSR) CEO José Cil announced the end of his term as chief executive and was replaced by insider Joshua Kobza.Dan Schulman, CEO of PayPal, delivers a keynote speech during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Febr. 22, 2016. (Albert Gea/REUTERS) (Albert Gea / Reuters)This turnover is happening in large part because of the macroeconomic and societal shifts that have happened as the worst of COVID-19 subsided, said London Business School professor Randall Peterson.""CEOs are changing over now because the situation has changed so dramatically in the last 18 months,"" he said. ""We went from super low interest rates, learning to work from home, and a Donald Trump world to the highest inflation in 40 years, people relearning to work in the presence of others, and Joe Biden’s very different style. What worked to get [companies] through COVID will not work now. We’ve had just long enough post COVID to really start seeing that.""Story continuesThese C-suite changes tend to mirror changes in the wider workforce.""In many cases, CEOs have taken very tough and necessary action to right-size their workforce and organizational structures,"" Keith Giarman, a managing partner at DHR Global, told Yahoo Finance. ""When you add all this up, coupled with the overarching workforce trend of prioritizing work-life balance, these impacts are being reflected on to the C-suite level as well. Is it any wonder CEOs are not necessarily geared up for the next iteration of the market, regardless of how much money we are paying them?""In particular, layoffs and CEO departures correlate over time, Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas senior vice president Andy Challenger said. Though ""it's not always exact,"" he said.""At the height of COVID, we saw huge numbers of layoffs, the highest we've ever seen, and we also saw very few CEO layoffs,"" Challenger explained. ""That was kind of one of those moments where the trends diverged. Companies didn't want to let go of their leaders in the crisis, but they were letting employees go.""""Now, we're seeing them much more highly correlated,"" he added, ""which I think is companies returning back to some sort of normalcy. ... They're bringing in leaders that are going to have a strategy that is going to work over this next period.""A man walks out through a propped-open door in New York City, New York, Sept. 23, 2019. (Yana Paskova/REUTERS) (Yana Paskova / reuters)It's not just CEOs who have been getting the boot lately. Companies are reshuffling their C-suites in all kinds of ways.For example, just this week Subway revealed Trevor Haynes, president of North America, would be leaving the company after almost two decades at the sandwich chain.But these sorts of shifts can make for risky times.""CEO change is always going to be a time of increased risk as new leaders tend to come in with less confidence than is ideal, and their priorities get reflected down the chain fairly quickly,"" Peterson said. ""If the organization or specific people are hungry for change, then this will be welcomed. If things have been going well, change can feel threatening to that success. So when you destabilize the most successful people, that is a risky time.""Still, a new board-chosen CEO can offer some insight into where companies want to go.There are benefits and drawbacks to choosing someone internally, as was the case at Kraft Heinz, or externally, as was the case at PayPal. External successors have grown increasingly common but don't always promise stability, BCG's Barton said.""In terms of the composition of internal to external hires, within the S&amp;P 500, we have seen material increases in external successors in 2018 and 2022,"" she told Yahoo Finance.""Over the last five years, the highest rates of external hires occurred in 2018 and 2019. This could reflect improvements in succession planning by smaller companies as well as the desire to maintain stability and experience in the role in the face of increasing external volatility, complexity, and expectations of CEOs.""In the case of Dutch Bros, Ricci said the CEO transition started before the company went public in 2021.""We were planning and executing the type of leadership and the leadership skill sets the company was going to need to really carry forward in the journey,"" Ricci said. ""Bringing Christine [Barone] on was natural. ... Over the five years, we've created something that's now on a national stage and took it public and managed COVID, and I'm just really proud of how full the cupboard is what we can do to put our leadership in a great position to succeed for the future.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Southwest Airlines LUV, Copa Holdings' CPA, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY, Delta Air Lines DAL and American Airlines AAL.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Airline Stock Roundup: Labor Deals, Traffic Reports &amp; MoreIn the past week, Southwest Airlines received encouraging news on the labor front when it reached a provisional agreement with the union that represents more than 17,000 of its ramp, operations, provisioning and cargo employees.Meanwhile, Copa Holdings' traffic report for July was impressive owing to the post-pandemic surge in air travel demand. Owing to the uptick in passenger volumes, European carrier Ryanair Holdings anticipates carrying a higher number of passengers in the current month than in July. If the expectation materializes, RYAAY would establish a new monthly traffic record.Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories1. The provisional deal inked between LUV's management and the Transport Workers Union Local 555 or TWU 555 provides substantial wage increase, better retirement and other benefits to the concerned employees.  The deal will materialize only if it is approved through the ratification voting process. The details of LUV's current agreement and voting timeline will be directly communicated to Southwest Airlines' members by TWU 555.2. In July, revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose in double digits, i.e., 12.5% on a year-over-year basis at CPA. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In July, available seat miles (a measure of capacity) increased 9.9% year over year. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 89% from 87% in July 2022.Story continuesCopa Holdings was also in the news when it reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues for second-quarter 2023. The news was covered in the previous week's write up.3. According to a Reuters report, Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings expects to carry more passengers in August than the actual figure in July. We remind investors that Ryanair carried 18.7 million passengers in July, which itself is a record. The load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) in July was as high as 96%.Per Eddie Wilson, the head of Ryanair DAC, the largest airline in the group, ""It should be slightly more (than July) ... people are still travelling."" Healthy booking trends have resulted in the upbeat expectation. Ryanair has been benefiting from the stronger-than-expected recovery in air travel demand from the pandemic lows.Currently, RYAAY carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.4.  In a bid to meet the strong recovery in international travel in the post-pandemic scenario, Delta Air Lines has decided to expand its flight schedule to China. To this end, this Atlanta-based carrier has decided to operate 10 weekly flights to the Shanghai-Pudong International Airport from its hubs in Seattle and Detroit hubs this winter.From Oct 29, the airline will operate daily flights from Shanghai and three-times-a-week flights from Detroit. Moreover, Delta intends to resume four-times-weekly flights to the Shanghai-Pudong International Airport from Los Angeles. DAL has not operated on the route since early 2020.According to a Reuters report, American Airlines has also decided to expand its China operations.

62,8b9949fc-e3ba-3e18-84b6-ae4db26bd08b,ROP,2023-08-19,DAT Truckload Volume Index: July freight volumes and rates chilled by seasonality,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dat-truckload-volume-index-july-142300786.html,1692368580,STORY,['ROP'],"[BEAVERTON, Ore., August 18, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Truckload freight volumes fell last month and national benchmark spot rates for dry van and refrigerated (""reefer"") loads retreated from their gains in June, reported DAT Freight &amp; Analytics, which operates the industry’s largest online freight marketplace and DAT iQ data analytics service.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230818042461/en/July freight volumes and rates chilled by seasonality (Graphic: DAT Freight &amp; Analytics)The DAT Truckload Volume Index (TVI), a measure of loads moved during a given month, was lower in July for all three equipment types:Van TVI was 226, down 7.0% from June and 3.0% lower year-over-year.Reefer TVI slipped to 169, 3.4% lower than in June but 1.2% higher year-over-year.Flatbed TVI was 238, 12.8% lower compared to June but 3.5% higher year-over-year.""Shippers faced service disruptions at the ports and in the less-than-truckload sector but were able to secure van capacity without causing the needle to move on spot rates and volumes,"" said Ken Adamo, Chief of Analytics.Despite month-over-month declines, the reefer and flatbed TVI numbers were the highest on record for July as fresh and frozen food, metals, machinery, construction materials and other seasonal freight moved through supply chains.Demand for trucks slowedNational average load-to-truck ratios for van and reefer freight have been virtually unchanged for three straight months:The van ratio was 2.6, equal to June and down from 3.8 in July 2022.The reefer ratio was 3.8 - unchanged from June and down from 7.2 a year earlier.The flatbed ratio was 7.1, down from 9.7 in June and significantly down from 21.8 in July 2022.Spot, contract rates dippedReflecting flat demand, DAT’s benchmark spot rates slipped in July:The spot van rate was $2.07 per mile, down 1 cent compared to June and 56 cents lower than in July 2022.The spot reefer rate dipped 3 cents to $2.44 per mile and 60 cents lower year-over-year.The spot flatbed rate was $2.54 a mile, down 7 cents month over month and 72 cents lower year-over-year.Story continuesLine-haul rates, which subtract an amount equal to a fuel surcharge, declined as well. DAT’s benchmark van line-haul rate was $1.63 per mile, down 2 cents compared to June. The reefer line-haul rate fell 5 cents to $1.96 per mile and the flatbed line-haul rate dropped 9 cents to $2.01 per mile.The average fuel surcharge increased by 2 cents to an average of 44 cents a mile for van freight, 48 cents for reefers and 53 cents for flatbeds in July.""Spot rates, as a reminder, are ‘all-in’ rates, meaning no separate fuel surcharge to help mitigate the risk of fuel price fluctuations. You have to negotiate each individual load with fuel and operating costs in mind, which is not always easy,"" Adamo said. ""The sudden increase in fuel prices is testing the wherewithal of small carriers at a time when freight volumes are in a seasonal lull.""DAT’s benchmark rates for contracted freight strengthened compared to pricing on the spot market. The van rate fell 1 cent to $2.57 a mile, the reefer rate gained 3 cents to $2.91 a mile and the flatbed rate rose 5 cents to $3.29 a mile.After closing for three straight months, the spread between contract and spot rates was unchanged for van freight and increased by 6 cents for reefers and 12 cents for flatbed loads. The size of the gap is an indicator of bargaining power among shippers, brokers and carriers, Adamo explained.About the DAT Truckload Volume IndexThe DAT Truckload Volume Index reflects the change in the number of loads with a pickup date during that month; the actual index number is normalized each month to accommodate any new data sources without distortion. A baseline of 100 equals the number of loads moved in January 2015, as recorded in DAT RateView, a truckload pricing database and analysis tool with rates paid on an average of 3 million loads per month.Spot truckload rates are negotiated for each load and paid to the carrier by a freight broker. DAT benchmark rates are derived from payments to carriers by freight brokers, third-party logistics providers and other transportation buyers for hauls of 250 miles or more with a pickup date during the month reported.

The contract is likely to be effective from Jul 1, 2024.The new contract will allow UnitedHealth Group to extend health care coverage and serve the diversified needs of New Mexico residents, who are members of the state’s Medicaid managed care program (Turquoise Care). It will also enable UNH to deepen its presence across states with a significant number of Medicaid enrollees. Apart from UNH, other managed care organizations were recently chosen by the New Mexico HSD to award Turquoise Care Medicaid contracts, which include BlueCross BlueShield, Presbyterian Health Plan and Molina’s New Mexico health plan.Inevitably, contract wins boost the customer base and fetch health insurers with higher premiums, which remain the most significant contributors to their top line. The medical membership of UnitedHealth Group grew 3.1% year over year as of Jun 30, 2023. Besides, its Medicaid membership witnessed a year-over-year increase of 4.6% at the same time.The strength of its Medicaid business has fetched numerous contract wins from time to time. In March 2023, the company won a contract from the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration. This was another commendable opportunity for UnitedHealth Group to penetrate a geography which serves around 100,000 Medicaid LTSS members. Contract wins like these are expected to help UnitedHealth Group achieve its 2023 revenue guidance in the range of $357-$360 billion.UnitedHealth Group served as a Medicaid administrator in Mexico from 2013 to 2018, which makes it an experienced candidate to support the health of New Mexicans. Currently, UNH has 210,000 plus members enrolled in individual, employer-sponsored and Medicare plans in New Mexico. It also has a network of 11,000 physicians and 49 hospitals in the state.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceUNH currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Shares of UnitedHealth Group have lost 6.8% year to date compared with the industry’s 5.2% decline.

The upbeat performance was driven by higher silver revenues, offset by lower zinc and lead revenues.  The top line however missed the consensus estimate of $25 million.Higher silver and lead production from the Galena Complex and increased silver production from the Cosalá Operations were partially offset by lower realized zinc prices in the quarter.Americas Gold and Silver Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Americas Gold and Silver Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAmericas Gold and Silver Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Americas Gold and Silver Corporation QuoteThe company’s consolidated attributable silver production surged 92% year over year to around 0.57 million in the quarter under review.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read Goldman Sachs Dividend Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.Investors love dividend stocks because they are reliable and often a refuge during tough times when the economy and markets are wavering. More importantly, dividends have a strong history of keeping up with inflation. In the US, companies that provide dividends usually perform better during times of high inflation and increasing interest rates compared to non-dividend payers. Additionally, they're often seen as safer choices, declining less than the overall market during downturns. This defensive quality is especially significant in the current unpredictable circumstances. Since 1926, dividends have represented nearly one-third of the stock market’s overall returns.Dividend stocks experienced a slight drop this year as other asset classes began to catch the interest of investors. This doesn't mean that dividend stocks have lost their appeal, as their demand remains steady regardless of the economic situation. In one of our previous articles on dividend investing we cited data from Fidelity Investments, which mentioned that dividends made over half of the market's gains in high inflationary periods. The study also highlighted specific periods, like the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, where dividends accounted for 67%, 44%, and 73% of market gains, respectively. These decades saw inflation averaging above 5%, and overall returns were less than 10%.Also read: Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 12 Stock PicksEarlier this year, David Kostin, a Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist, gave an optimistic view regarding dividend stocks. He expects a 5% increase in dividend payments from S&amp;P 500 companies this year, with the potential for further growth. Here are some comments from the analyst:""We expect that S&amp;P 500 DPS [dividend-per-share] will reach $70 in 2023 and $73 (+4%) in 2024. Recent company actions also point to a healthy dividend growth environment. The difference in outlooks for dividend and buyback growth suggests firms focusing on dividends will continue to outperform buyback stocks.""Story continuesHe further mentioned that investors often consider companies that have long dividend growth histories because such companies are often financially sound, with the ability to generate sustained profits. By continuously boosting dividends, these companies prioritize providing returns to their shareholders, appealing to those seeking stable income and potential capital appreciation.In this article, we will discuss the top dividend stocks in Goldman Sachs's portfolio.

69,687a716e-db53-365b-ab22-72cdee3ee7a3,GS,2023-08-19,Here are the leading bidders in Goldman’s sale of GreenSky,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leading-bidders-goldman-sale-greensky-113742366.html,1692358662,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[As Goldman Sachs exits parts of the consumer banking business, it's been inching closer to finding a buyer for GreenSky.Second-round bids for GreenSky were due earlier in August, or about two weeks ago, four banking and private equity sources told my colleague Luisa Beltran. In the running is a consortium of investors led by Sixth Street, which is trying to buy GreenSky, the people said. There's also Apollo Global Management, which isn't part of the Sixth Street investor group, that is also vying for the specialty lender, the story said.Here's more:Goldman is weighing different options for GreenSky, the people said. It could sell the GreenSky platform and loan book to one party, or it could offload the platform to one party and sell the loan book to another. Or Goldman could sell the platform and keep the existing loan book. Goldman received different bids for the different the options and it’s unclear how the offers line up. Proposals came in at between $500 million to $1 billion, one of the bankers said, while others said the bids were half of what Goldman paid in 2022, they said. (The GreenSky acquisition was initially valued at $2.24 billion in September 2021 but dropped to $1.7 billion when the transaction closed the following March.)It’s unlikely there will be a third round of bidding for GreenSky. “They need to finish,” one of the people said. “This is a super long, long process,” said one banker, who wasn’t involved in the auction.Could the second time be the charm for Apollo to snap up GreenSky, the fintech founded in 2006 that helps consumers get home improvement loans?The current sale of GreenSky gives Apollo another chance to buy GreenSky, which was up for sale in 2019. Late that year, Goldman made $7 a share, or about $1.3 billion cash offer to buy GreenSky, according to a regulatory filing. The process went dormant after Goldman refused to raise its bid and GreenSky ended up calling off the auction in August 2020, the filing said. In mid-2021, Goldman resumed talks to buy GreenSky and the discussions heated up after a private equity firm, identified in the filing as “Financial Sponsor D,” made an offer to buy the lender. The unnamed private equity firm, which the Wall Street Journal reported was Apollo, tried to preempt the process and then engaged in a bidding war with Goldman for GreenSky, according to the filing. Goldman Sachs ended up winning the process, agreeing to buy GreenSky for about $12.15 a share in September 2021, the filing said. It completed the acquisition in March 2022. Roughly one year later, in April, Goldman confirmed that it had put GreenSky up for sale.Story continuesYou can read the full story here.An important programming note…I wanted to say a quick word and thank Jackson Fordyce for his tireless efforts curating the Term Sheet deals section every single day since he joined us in January 2022.

This is impressive, given the ongoing inflationary pressures, high interest rates and persisting supply-chain disruptions.Strategic acquisitions will also aid growth of the company.Let’s delve deeper and analyze the factors that make this stock worth holding on to at present.Demand in E-Commerce to Aid Growth: Despite the current weakness, Packaging Corp stands to gain from strong growth in e-commerce activities that has led to increased demand for packaging.The Packaging segment accounts for around 91% of the company’s revenues. Packaging products are essential for distributing food, beverage and pharmaceutical products. The Packaging segment will continue to be supported by stable packaging demand for meat, fruit and vegetables, processed food, beverages, medicine, and other consumer products.Optimistic Outlook: In the third quarter of 2023, shipments per day are anticipated to improve sequentially despite one less shipping day for the corrugated business.In the Paper segment, volumes are expected to pick up, aided by back-to-school shipments. These tailwinds are expected to boost performance in the upcoming quarters as well.Acquisitions to Boost Growth: In December 2021, the company acquired all assets of Advanced Packaging Corporation in a cash-free transaction. The company acquired a full-line 500,000-square-foot corrugated products facility located in Grand Rapids, MI.The deal supported Packaging Corp’s focus on enhancing its containerboard portfolio through organic box volume growth and strategic box plant acquisitions. This will also boost the company’s mill capacity and box plant operations.Price Performance: Packaging Corp’s shares have gained 1.1% in the past year against the industry’s fall of 10.2%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Near-Term ConcernsGlobal and domestic economic conditions continue to be less favorable, with ongoing inflationary pressures, high interest rates and persisting supply-chain disruptions. As customers are working to lower their high inventory levels, it has impacted the order flow and demand for Packaging Corp’s products.Containerboard production in the upcoming quarters will likely be lower as the company plans to match production with demand. The company anticipates lower prices in the Packaging segment in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of the recent decreases in the published domestic containerboard prices, as well as lower export prices.In the Paper segment, prices are suggested to trend lower based on the recent declines in index prices.Packaging Corp expects to complete the scheduled annual maintenance outage and the first phase of the containerboard conversion work on the No. 3 machine at the Jackson, AL-based mill. The No.3 machine has reached the first-phase design capacity and is producing high-quality virgin linerboard. However, given the current containerboard demand, the company decided to postpone the second phase of the conversion work until 2024.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderPackaging Corp currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the Industrial Products sector are Worthington Industries, Inc.

Shares have lost about 7.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Netflix due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Netflix Q2 Earnings Beat, Revenues Up Y/Y on User GainNetflix reported second-quarter 2023 earnings of $3.29 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.25% and increased 2.8% year over year.Revenues of $8.19 billion increased 2.7% year over year but lagged the consensus mark by 0.93%. On a foreign-exchange neutral basis, revenues grew 6% year over year.The streaming giant gained 5.89 million paid subscribers globally, thanks to a crackdown on password-sharing and the introduction of paid sharing in more than 100 countries in May, which represents more than 80% of Netflix’s revenue base. The company lost 0.97 million paid subscribers in the year-ago quarter.Netflix now expects revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of 2023, driven by the launch of paid sharing. However, it anticipates foreign-exchange neutral average revenues per membership (ARM) to be flat to slightly down year over year due to limited price increases over the past 12 months and immaterial revenues from advertising and paid-sharing.ARM decreased 3% year over year on a reported basis and 1% on a foreign-exchange neutral basis in the second quarter. ARM declined due to a higher mix of membership growth from lower ARM countries and limited price increases over the past 12 months.Netflix scrapped the basic ad-free plan for new and rejoining members in Canada and is doing the same for U.K. and U.S.-based subscribers.At the end of the second quarter, the company had 238.39 million paid subscribers globally, up 8% year over year.Although Netflix is suffering from growing competition from services provided by Amazon, Disney and Apple, it benefited from a strong content portfolio in the reported quarter.Hit shows like The Night Agent, Beef, Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story and Love is Blind S4 helped Netflix win subscribers.

The $13.2 plan provides 2GB of 5G data daily, and the $18 plan offers 3GB daily data. Both plans are valid for 84 days and feature unlimited free voice calls.""We are thrilled to expand our relationship with Jio. Over the years, we have launched a variety of successful local shows, documentaries and films which have been loved by audiences across India. Our collection of must watch stories is growing and our new prepaid bundle partnership with Jio will give more customers access to this exciting line-up of Indian content as well as some incredible stories from around the world,"" said Tony Zameczkowski, vice president of APAC Partnerships for Netflix, in a statement.This is the first time Netflix has partnered with a telecom operator in India to offer the streaming service on a prepaid, or pay-as-you-go plan, Reliance said. (An existing partnership between the two firms also offers a Netflix subscription with the carrier's postpaid and fibre plans. The vast majority of people in India top up their phones with pay-as-you-go plans instead of subscribing to the typical recurring subscription common in most developed markets.)The deepening partnership between the companies underscores the unique approach Netflix takes in India, where the average revenue per subscriber is markedly lower than in the U.S. and U.K. The expansion coincides with Netflix raising its subscription prices in the U.S. and several other developed markets multiple times in recent quarters, as well as a global crackdown on password-sharing.Story continuesFor Jio Platforms, India's leading telecom with over 450 million users, Friday's move highlights the intensity of Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries unit's efforts to outpace rivals Bharti Airtel and Vodafone-Idea.

Ross Stores topped quarterly estimates and improved its outlook, with its shares rising about 6% on Thursday upon Thursday's report during extended trading. Premium cosmetics giant, The Estee Lauder Companies (NYSE: EL), issued a weak guidance and slow recovery of its business in Asia. Farfetch Limited (NYSE: FTCH) stock tanked after the luxury fashion e-commerce retailer posted a big revenue miss and weaker than expected guidance. These latest reports continue the trend that Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) and Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) portrayed earlier which is that high-end and premium ‘wants’ retailers are on the losing side of this macroeconomic chapter, while necessities and off-price retailers are on the winning one, with customers still being willing to splurge and find bargainsf for discounted premium goods.Ross Stores jumped nearly 5% a day upon its report. Like TJX who reported steady sales of its discount apparel and accessories and a stronger than expected demand for home decor goods, the discount retailer topped both sales and earnings estimates for its second quarter.  Net sales grew 7.7% to $4.93 billion, topping the expected $4.75 billion with earnings per share amounting to $1.32, surpassing Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $1.16. While Ross Stores previously expected its 2023 same-store sales be stay relatively flat, it now expects them to expand between 2% and 3%. The off-price retailer also lifted its annual profit per share guidance from the previous range of $4.77 to $4.99 to a newly projected range of $5.15 to $5.26.As for the e-commerce fashion platform, Farfetch made a big revenue miss as it reported it generated $572 million in the second quarter, which is a far cry from Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $649 million. Its shares tanked 41% in early morning trading upon results as the e-commerce luxury fashion retailer provided a weaker-than-expected full year guidance as well as trimmed its gross merchandise value outlook. With a second quarter report riddled with disappointing figures and debt, Farfetch suffered on the side of losing high-end retailers.Story continuesEstee Lauder, who was once the star of challenging times thanks to “the lipstick index” its chairman coined, didn’t get to be a winner in these post-pandemic recessionary times. As skincare replacing lipsticks when COVID-19 started its relentless march across the globe, now the beauty brand reported declining sales for its fiscal fourth quarter. Still, it succeeded to top fourth quarter earnings and revenue estimates. Adjusted earnings per share of 7 cents surpassed the loss of 4 cents per share that Refinitiv’s survey of analysts expected, while revenue of $3.61 billion topped Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $3.48 billion. For the undergoing first fiscal quarter, Estee Lauder is expecting an EPS loss in the range between 31 and 21 cents per share, while Fact Set’s survey of analysts earnings per share of 98 cents. Its shares tanked 4% as the cosmetics giant lowered its full-year outlook.Consumer Behavior Brought Darkness To High End Retailers And Dawn To Discounted RetailersTJX and Ross Stores inflation-hit customers shopped for its discounted clothing and shoes and looking for bargains on premium apparel brands. Despite tightened household spending, consumers looked for cheaper deals on both essentials and non-essentials. While high-end retailers struggled with bloated inventories, they were ‘rescued’ by discounting retailers who got to offer a wider assortment as a result of offloading their inventories. Therefore, consumers are not willing to give up on splurges despite tightened budgets but are approaching them in a cost-conscious way, leaving high-end retailers in the dark while boosting revenue of discount retailers such as TJX and Ross Stores.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

PLCE reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein both top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, this pure-play children’s specialty apparel retailer witnessed a year-over-year decline in both the metrics.Management narrowed down its previously provided fiscal 2023 guidance for the top and bottom line and issued a dismal third-quarter guidance owing to a tough macroeconomic environment and tempered consumer sentiment.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have increased 14.7% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 6.2%.The Children's Place, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Children's Place, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe Children's Place, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Children's Place, Inc. Quote Q2 in DetailThe Children’s Place posted an adjusted loss per share of $2.12, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $2.16 per share. The company posted an adjusted loss of 89 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Net sales of $345.6 million declined 9.3% year over year, primarily due to soft consumer demand stemming from a high inflationary environment and the impact of permanent store closures. Comparable retail sales declined 9% in the reported quarter compared with our estimate of a 7.7% decline. Net sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $342 million.Management highlighted that digital channel comprised 51% of retail sales during the reported quarter compared with 47% in the year-ago period. The company witnessed low double-digit growth in e-commerce traffic during the fiscal second quarter.Adjusted gross profit came in at $87.8 million, down $27 million from $114.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted gross margin deleveraged 480 basis points (bps) to 25.4% due to increased input and supply chain costs and the impacts of the accelerated liquidation of seasonal inventory. Deleverage of fixed costs due to softness in net sales was also a reason. We expected an adjusted gross margin of 28.2% for the quarter under review.Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses came in at $101.7 million, down from $113.5 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted SG&amp;A, as a percentage of sales, deteriorated by 40 bps to 29.4% and fared better than our estimate of 33%. The metric declined due to reduced store expenses, equity compensation expenses and home office payroll, partially offset by the deleveraging of fixed costs and planned higher marketing spend.Adjusted operating loss came in at $25 million compared with an adjusted operating loss of $11.7 million posted in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating loss as a percentage of net sales deleveraged 410 bps to 7.2%. Our estimate for adjusted operating loss was $27.8 million for the quarter under review.Story continuesStore UpdateThe company ended the quarter with 596 stores. With respect to its store fleet optimization strategy, PLCE permanently shuttered 603 stores since 2013. It plans to close 80-100 stores in fiscal 2023.Other Financial AspectsThe Children’s Place ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $19 million. The company had $348 million outstanding on its revolving credit facility as of Jul 29, 2023. Stockholders' equity at the end of the quarter was $85.9 million.OutlookPLCE estimates third-quarter fiscal 2023 net sales of $470-$475 million, representing approximately a 7% decline from the year-ago figure. It expects gross margin to expand by 200-300 bps. The company envisions quarterly adjusted operating profit to be approximately 13.5% of net sales. Lastly, adjusted net earnings per share is anticipated in the band of $3.55-$3.65 in the fiscal third quarter. For the fiscal third quarter, it expects interest expenses of $7-$7.5 million, while the tax rate is projected in the range of 20%-21%.For the second half of fiscal 2023, PLCE expects net sales of $910-$920 million, indicating a year-over-year decline in the mid-single digit percentage range. Adjusted operating income is likely to be 10% of net sales during the second half. Adjusted net earnings per share is anticipated in the band of $5.00-$5.25 in the same period. For the second half of fiscal 2023, it expects an interest expense of $13 million, while the tax rate is projected in the range of 20%-21%.Management downgraded its view for fiscal 2023 owing to tough macroeconomic headwinds. For fiscal 2023, net sales are anticipated between $1.575 billion and $1.585 billion, narrowing down from the previous guidance of $1.575-$1.590 billion. The metric is expected to decline from $1.71 billion reported in fiscal 2022.Adjusted operating income is likely to be in the band of 2.7-3% of net sales during the fiscal year.

How hard are rising costs of living hitting Americans and are adjustments keeping up? Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith, Dani Romero, Diane King Hall, and Julie Hyman explore how various factors, from student loan payments and child care costs to inflation, may be pricing consumers out from various living essentials.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Welcome back, everyone. You're watching ""Yahoo Finance Live"". And for this special Friday conversation bringing your way focus on cost of living right now and particularly here as we've continued to see a lot of retail data come out over the course of this week.Some of the focus needs to still be on areas where inflation is remaining increasingly sticky. Housing is one of those. But also if you look at the main areas that consumers are going to be concerned about it is what they're paying just for their cost of living and housing and shelter but also energy where that factors into what they're purchasing here.And we've got, of course, our panel that has brought together some great statistics. And we've got Dani Romero, of course, Diane King Hall, and Julie Hyman, yours truly Brad Smith here, and as we think about where the cost of living is. There's so much geographical focus, but perhaps we start with where homes particularly have continued and the prices there for shelter costs have continued to remain elevated. This is something you track on a day in, day out basis standing.DANI ROMERO: And housing has two categories. We have houses like homes, and we also have rents. So they're a little bit separate. But let's go to the housing front specifically. Consumers are still very sensitive to rates. And now that mortgage rates hovered way north of that 7%, you're really seeing that pull back in demand.Story continuesBut another perspective is that today's rates are actually at a normalized level if you compare it to prior to 2008. So that's to give you some perspective. Wow, to us, it might be a little bit of a shocker. But if we compare it to historical levels, it is about normal range, the 7%. But we're also seeing that the Fed's efforts to crush inflation is really happening in that housing market. Demand is slowing down. The applications to purchase a home hit the lowest level.JULIE HYMAN: But are prices coming down?DANI ROMERO: That's the issue. And it goes back to that inventory issue, the supply and demand side of things. And inventory is still a big issue. But I think on the housing front specifically, it's the affordable inventory.DIANE KING HALL: And it's not enough. With rates continuing to rise, like that 7% level, should it get to 8%, that's not going to get any buyers in the market. I mean, people are sitting on levels. Like if they got in a home at 3%, 3.25%, they're not going to sell their home now because they can't get something new for better. So they're going to stay in that starter home for longer.It's going to become more than a starter home. They may raise their kids through college there because of where rates are now. And the indications when we think about where the Fed could potentially go and especially what we heard this week in terms of the minutes, it could go higher. And that just continues to hurt demand within the housing market.DANI ROMERO: One way that an economist had explained to me is that if mortgage rates go up, there's actually more inventory that gets onto the market because the cost of households goes up. And so that squeezes the person.And so if rates are lower, if mortgage rates go down, that means there's lower inventory because people-- that spurs up the whole [? horroring. ?] I'm going to stay in my home. But that was a dynamic that an economist brought up of how he's looking at the market right now. So that's kind of an interesting perspective to look at too.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah, it's hard to see it that way. And I mean, we talked to economists after economist about if it's a buyer's market, is it a seller's market. And the point that many of them come back to is, it's neither, you know? You can't go anywhere really.I was shocked when I saw that number. I know from a historical perspective, it's certainly not the highest we've ever seen if we go back to the '80s. I don't know if all of us were around in the '80s. I know at least three of us were.DANI ROMERO: Don't age yourself. Don't age yourself.DIANE KING HALL: It's fine. I mean--JULIE HYMAN: Two of us.DIANE KING HALL: Two of us. Oh, OK. Right.BRAD SMITH: I was here.JULIE HYMAN: You were here in the '80s?BRAD SMITH: Yeah, first image of it.JULIE HYMAN: Yes, first image.DIANE KING HALL: Happy birthday shout out on air. We have to do it. It's only apropos.BRAD SMITH: But the cost of living has certainly risen a lot since then. And when we think about so many of the different factors that consumers right now are faced with, there's housing, there's your energy costs. And energy costs have receded from some of the highs that we had seen even a year ago.And you think back to even the retail sales data that we've seen. And that gives us a sense of how consumers are spending, and where they're looking at price. And for the retail companies that have reported earnings this week, while volumes might be receding a little bit, that price that they're having to pass on, that continuing to remain elevated as well.JULIE HYMAN: I keep thinking too about there's the cost of living and there's the perception of cost of living. And while we tend to talk to a lot of economists who talk about disinflation, the rate of inflation--DIANE KING HALL: SlowingJULIE HYMAN: --is decreasing, I don't think that's how consumers look at the issue.DIANE KING HALL: No.JULIE HYMAN: If you go to the grocery store, you're not saying, oh, well, I'm only paying 2/10 of a percent more this month than I was paying last month. You're thinking year over year. You're thinking over time, and you're thinking more of a vibe, more of a feeling.I mean, if you look at the food at home prices in July on an unseasonably adjusted basis, they rose 3.6% year-over-year. So away food in restaurants rose about 7% year-over-year. So even if you don't know exactly what those figures are and even if it isn't going up at the same rate month-over-month, you still feel like you're spending more. And that is also going to inform your spending decisions in a number of different areas.DIANE KING HALL: That's right. And we saw that play out in the numbers at Target versus Walmart. I mean, Walmart was the winner there in terms of the grocery spend. Walmart gets-- I mean, we don't know what it is for the quarter but annually, they get about half of their revenue from grocery. So they're winning there because to your point, consumers are spending on needs. They have to buy food. Even if inflation is still sticky when it comes to food, you have to. You can't not eat, right? Excuse the double negative.But Target they only get what? About a fifth of their sales from grocery. I mean, look at their grocery section. It's much smaller. We had a conversation about that early in the week. And you're not-- generally when you're going to Target, that's not necessarily what you're going for. And if you're making cuts to your budget and what you're spending on, you're going to cut out those non-essentials.So Target did a little bit better in beauty, but it wasn't enough to account for that slowdown and what they're seeing in other areas. Nobody needs to replace their throw pillows every quarter or whatever. You're not replacing all your accessories. So Target needs to do something different.And we saw also the difference between Target and Walmart when it comes to e-commerce. So Walmart did better on e-commerce as well, and that was a surprise. They did 24% better whereas Target saw a slowdown. Target's talking on their earnings call about making some changes to mobile, et cetera.But again Target also appeals to that more higher end shopper. And another kind of thing that we're waiting for and what this may do to quote unquote, ""higher end shopper"" is the student loan payments coming back, what that's going to do to people's budgets, right?BRAD SMITH: Right and so--DANI ROMERO: But will it though? Because a lot of the student loans have-- I was reading your ""Morning Brief"", Julie, and you really hammered that point home that, is it really going to impact those budgets? I mean, I already got my student loan payment requirement, what I'm supposed to do. So, I mean, yeah, you look at it and you're like, OK, I see it. This is-- I mean, it's lower for me than what I was paying before, but that's because I've been chucking away at it.JULIE HYMAN: And that was the argument that I cited in that ""Morning Brief"". It was from some Bank of America research that essentially said, the people who suspended their student loan payments when they were given the opportunity to do so are people whose household balance sheets were not in great shape to begin with.So in other words, when they have to repay the marginal spend that's going to go away is smaller than it would be for someone who's in better financial shape anyway. So in other words, it's going to be just a smaller hit. Yes, for that individual, it's going to make a difference. But if you look at the wholesale effect on consumer spending, it might not be that huge. Now take it in concert with the work down in excess savings and some of the other effects--DIANE KING HALL: Exactly.JULIE HYMAN: --maybe you'll have a difference. But I also go back to the idea of consumers being more choosy. When Walmart talks about high net-worth consumers spending at Walmart, trading down to Walmart, it's not necessarily because those folks cannot afford to shop at Whole Foods or a Target or wherever else. Maybe it's because they took that family vacation to Europe.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: And so they're reallocating--DIANE KING HALL: Their spendingJULIE HYMAN: --their money. So, yes, the cost of living for everyone has gone higher, but spending hasn't necessarily on a real level, real spending if you account for changes in inflation, that picture is not as clear.BRAD SMITH: So just to bring this all together here because there's a few topics that we've talked about; we've talked about the cost of shelter; we've talked about the cost of just transportation, kind of getting around and gas, but also the necessity and food as well. But what does this all come back to in your cost of living? It's how much you're making, which you were starting to get into a moment ago.And if we're looking at where that marries up to the data that we've already seen, the August 4th reading even in the survey of consumers as they had noted there, the environment, the economic environment, consumers are perceiving little difference from last month substantial improvements relative to three months ago here. And what does this come back to? It comes back to how much they're making and where the job opportunities to continue to come forward.And so even within that, we've been continuing to have the conversation about where there's been so much investment in the US, whether that is making sure that there are more chip factories that are getting brought online. We just had a conversation this morning about industrials and where they need to back though for some of those jobs too.And so then you see this circular motion of, well, if the wages need to still continue to go higher in those categories that are still hiring heavily, how does that still continue to add to the broader inflationary picture where companies are saying, all right, well, if the employment environment is strong, then people are still going to be willing to pay up just a little bit more.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah. And I mean, that is a good point, especially when you think about how robust the job market has been. We've continued to see it hold up in the front of expectations for it to weaken and it hasn't. And that begs the question about what direction are we going in terms of also this fight against inflation. Are we going to continue to go higher? Is it again also that theme that we've heard higher for longer, and then what that does in general to the economy?JULIE HYMAN: I mean, at this point you have a lot of economists saying that the Fed is going to cut rates next year just to bring rates more down to a normal level. If indeed though you see the same trajectory we've been seeing where wages remain relatively elevated because most of the folks we're talking to are still seeing it might not be as hard to find workers, but it's still not easy for them necessarily to find workers, particularly in the services industry. And then you can add on the new chip factories and all of that onto that.So if you're going to see that persistence, are you going to have the Fed with the ability to cut rates? It's far from a certain outcome.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah, and definitely not right now.DANI ROMERO: I wanted to say one thing that we haven't discussed is the population. I mean, we've been growing. I mean, the pandemic babies, that's also another factor that I think we weren't seeing before and now we're seeing it. Right now we have a newborn. People I know, my friends have newborns. And so that's something to consider in your budget too.I mean, if before you were doing OK, now you have a newborn or two newborns, childcare costs is really-- household formation is happening. We're seeing that more so now than obviously during the pandemic. And also immigration is part of this too. So I think those are all other factors to factor into this living cost equation.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And child care costs, by the way, are not slowing down.DIANE KING HALL: Yes--BRAD SMITH: No.DIANE KING HALL: --they're not.JULIE HYMAN: They're not So that's something--DIANE KING HALL: We've had that con-- yeah, like just the conversation about that and what people are choosing to do when they figure out how they're going to manage their budget around that. It is expensive. Childcare is expensive. So we had this conversation about some people doing things like taking their kid with them to a bar which--JULIE HYMAN: There's an article about that that wasn't there.DIANE KING HALL: Yes, some bars are family friendly.DANI ROMERO: Here in New York I feel likeBRAD SMITH: I know my buddy took his child.JULIE HYMAN: I mean, stick a baby in a carriage you can take them anywhere, trust me.DIANE KING HALL: Yes.JULIE HYMAN: When they're small enough--DIANE KING HALL: Yes, take them with you.JULIE HYMAN: They're portable.DIANE KING HALL: Exactly. They are portable.BRAD SMITH: You just got to be able to check that sippy cup and a good amount of time.JULIE HYMAN: That's right.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah.BRAD SMITH: Absolutely. I believe we've got to leave things there on the day before things get a little too saucy out here.JULIE HYMAN: But wait, we got one more thing to say.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, what's that?JULIE HYMAN: Happy birthday, Brad.

Meanwhile earnings from Walmart (WMT) and TJX (TJX) were strong, whereas Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) sales took a hit. New York Times Retail Reporter Jordyn Holman joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what these recent earnings results are showing about the state of the consumer.Holman explains how consumers are being discerning at this time, which is something Walmart CEO Doug McMillon noted on the company’s earnings call. “People are buying groceries, they’re trading down,” which is “part of this longer trend that we’ve been seeing over the past year,” Holman says. Walmart has “a bigger leg up” than Target, Holman says because it sells more groceries and has lower price points. Target also experienced boycotts in June over pride-themed displays at stores, which impacted the company’s sales.As this summer saw consumers spending on goods for experiences such as Barbie and tours from superstars Taylor Swift and Beyoncé, Holman notes that although “people have been spending a lot on those experiences as expected...they’re still leaving space in their budget to buy the groceries or buy some of the bigger items that we weren’t expecting.” “It still remains to be seen how long that can last,” as people have a “finite amount of money,” but that’s “one of these really interesting dynamics that’s happened this summer,” Holman says.Video Transcript- It has been a huge week for retail, starting with retail sales for July blowing past estimates to rise 0.7% on a monthly basis, showing that the consumer is still strong. Then we had earnings galore. Home Depot, Target continuing to struggle in sales growth as consumers traded down. Meanwhile, Walmart and TJX excelled as they captured those cautious shoppers. Apparently, that's hard to say, cautious shoppers looking for deals.Joining us now with more on this week in retail is Jordyn Holman, New York Times retail reporter. And you wrote about Target among other things this week and how they were not necessarily participating here, Jordyn. One of the things we've been talking about this morning is sort of the selectiveness, the discretion that shoppers are exercising right now. Because it's not that they're not spending, it's just they're only buying certain stuff. So how are you sort of thinking about the bigger themes here?Story continuesJORDYN HOLMAN: Yes. I think it's part of this longer trend that we've been seeing over the past year, I would say, about people are buying groceries. They're trading down. Meaning, they're buying private label if they're buying groceries or apparel. And when you look at a store like Target and you compare it with Walmart, Walmart just has a bigger leg up because they sell more groceries than a Target does. And then they do have lower price points relative to a Target.And so that's kind of that discerning nature. And even Walmart's CEO yesterday, on a call with investors, used that word. Customers are being discerning. And that's why Walmart is winning right now this environment.- I mean, we're looking at some of these shoppers with a household income of about $100,000 really honing in on Walmart here, especially when it comes to groceries. What's Walmart going to do to have to hang on to some of these shoppers? And how key are they to the bottom line?JORDYN HOLMAN: I thought that was actually a really interesting point that Doug McMillon, Walmart CEO, made yesterday on the call. He said these higher income shoppers are coming into Walmart because they also are trying to save money where they can, and that is through grocery. But once they have them in the store, that opens up an opportunity to maybe sell them more discretionary items. Maybe you're selling them the clothes or an interesting-- like cooking supplies or whatnot.And so that's one strategy that they're using to bring them in. And then also, given that this is a back-to-school season, that's a crucial selling holiday that sets them up for Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas to keep them coming back for that even more crucial selling season.- Jordyn, we continue to talk about, and hear from actually, many of the executives who are trying to lean into cultural relevance in order to grow out the client base, the customer base, that they're able to welcome into their stores and able to perhaps create a deeper relationship with. But then issues on the other side when they waver on their stances. And that was the issue for Target. How much did they shoot themselves in the foot this quarter?JORDYN HOLMAN: Yes. As I'm sure we all remember back during Pride Month or actually just a few days before June, Target was at the center of an anti-LGBTQ boycott given their pride merchandise, where Target moved a lot of the merchandise to the back of the store. And that issue came up again in their earnings, noting that in June, they did take a sales hit because-- I mean, in addition to the consumer pullback, there is obviously consumers who said, I'm not shopping with Target.The CEO got a lot of questions on the call about that. Where does Target stand when they want to support a specific community? And Target said, hey, we want to be welcoming to all people. We learn from that. And we don't quite know what that will mean-- of how that shows up at Target. But I think what was clear is that cultural issue came up in a financial call. So it's all intertwined and it's just putting a fine point on the idea that culture and sales and retail are all connected.- And Jordyn, I want to talk about some of the discernment that we've seen on good spending. Meanwhile, people were willing to risk it all together-- outfits together for Beyonce, for Taylor Swift, for Barbie as well. How much of this is going to be a blip? Being that you have these huge tours that people are spending on and really getting dressed up and spending on goods, how much of an anomaly is this though?JORDYN HOLMAN: Yeah, I was talking to our analysts about this yesterday. There was this idea going into the year that people would just pull back on spending a lot on goods, and that it would just be a summer and a year of experiences and the concerts and the movies. But there's a lot more dynamics at play. Yes, people have been spending a lot on those experiences as expected. But they're still leaving space in their budget to buy the groceries or buy some of the bigger items that we weren't expecting.And I think it still remains to be seen how long that can last because we all do have a finite amount of money. But that is definitely one of these really interesting dynamics that's happened this summer.- What's the setup for the holiday season? Now coming off of what we've kind of started to get some insight into the back-to-school season, and then even further as we perhaps all get ready to dress like Barbie and Ken all over again once we hit Halloween.JORDYN HOLMAN: Yes. So retailers are planning conservatively still for the back half of this year because student loan repayments have to start again. Interest rates are still high. Inflation is still stubborn. So we're not out of the clear yet. But when going back to Walmart, for them, they're like, well that's actually-- we play well in that.People are already looking to save money. They'll come to us for all of those things. But a company like Home Depot, Walgreens, Target, they all said that they're playing more conservatively for the holiday season. And it will be a nice surprise if that is a strong one.- Certainly, that consumer hanging in there, at least for now. A big thank you to Jordyn Holman, New York Times retail reporter. Thank you for joining us today.]"

It is worth considering Macy's (M), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Regional Department Stores industry.This department store operator has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 20.74%.For the last reported quarter, Macy's came out with earnings of $0.56 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.46 per share, representing a surprise of 21.74%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.57 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.88 per share, delivering a surprise of 19.75%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Macy's lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Macy's has an Earnings ESP of +6.59% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on August 22, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Macy's (M) earns a Zacks Rank #3 four days from its next quarterly earnings release on August 22, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.14 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.14 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.13 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Macy's has an Earnings ESP of 6.59%.M is just one of a large group of Retail-Wholesale stocks with a positive ESP figure. Costco (COST) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Costco, which is readying to report earnings on September 26, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $4.77 a share, and COST is 39 days out from its next earnings report.Costco's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.08% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.72.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, M and COST could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

West Pharmaceutical surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 12.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Proprietary Products Segment: We are upbeat about West Pharmaceutical’s proprietary products business, which continues to exhibit sustained strength and is an important contributor to the company’s top line. In the second quarter of 2023, high-value products or HVP (components and devices) represented more than 70% of segment sales, led by customer demand for Westar components and HVP devices. The Generics market unit had high-single-digit organic net sales growth and the Pharma market unit had mid-single-digit organic net sales growth during the same time.Continued Strength in R&amp;D: West Pharmaceutical maintains its research-scale production facilities and laboratories for creating new products and provides contract engineering design and development services to help customers with new product development. These raise our optimism. In second-quarter 2023, the company’s R&amp;D expenses increased from the prior-year quarter. WST continues to invest in elastomeric packaging components, formulation development, drug containment systems, self-injection systems and drug administration consumables.Story continuesStrong Q2 Results: West Pharmaceutical’s organic growth in second-quarter 2023 buoys optimism. The company expects business performance in the second half of 2023 to be better than the first half, reflecting higher top-line and bottom-line outlooks. This also looks promising for the stock.DownsidesInformation Security Breaches: West Pharmaceutical’s systems and networks, along with that of its customers and other stakeholders, might have become the target of cyberattacks and information security breaches in the future. This can lead to unauthorized release and misuse of confidential or proprietary information about the company and its employees or customers and can also hamper or damage its operations or that of third parties. Failure to comply with regulations or prevent the unauthorized access can result in financial losses and hurt the company’s reputation.Macroeconomic Challenges: Uncertainty in the global economy, which includes recession or slow economic growth in the United States, Europe or emerging markets in Asia and South America, can have adverse effects on the company’s operating results. If there is a weakness in economic conditions in the country or Europe, or emerging markets, the company’s operations might be negatively impacted.Estimate TrendWest Pharmaceutical has been witnessing an upward estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 2.6% north to $7.83.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $746.9 million, suggesting an 8.7% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Patterson Companies, Inc.

NVRO recently announced the publication of 24-month data from the SENZA Painful Diabetic Neuropathy (PDN) Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) in Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice. The SENZA-PDN trial enrolled 216 patients with refractory PDN, where 142 patients were implanted with Nevro's high-frequency (10 kHz) spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system, Nevro HFX, and were followed for 24 months.The latest publication of favorable results is expected to strengthen Nevro’s foothold in the SCS therapy business.Significance of the DataPer Nevro’s estimates, the number of diabetics has quadrupled in the last two decades globally, and PDN is one of its most common complications, affecting up to 25% of people with diabetes. PDN symptoms, which can significantly impact the quality of life, include numbness and tingling, among others. Patients typically manage complications with oral pain medications, but the efficacy of these medications is relatively low and can result in intolerable side effects for patients. This may lead PDN patients to suffer significantly-reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and other comorbidities like sleep disorders, depression and anxiety.However, the published 24-month data from the SENZA-PDN RCT demonstrated that patients who received a high-frequency 10 kHz SCS implant and conventional medical management (CMM) experienced durable pain relief and significant improvements in both HRQoL and sleep at 24 months post-implantation, unlike CMM alone. Additionally, most participants experienced neurological symptom improvements. The long-term data further supports 10 kHz SCS as a safe and highly-effective therapy for PDN and a therapy that establishes durable quality-of-life improvements.Per an expert associated with the SENZA-PDN RCT, the 24-month data validates that high-frequency SCS is a viable and long-term relief solution for people with PDN. This shows promise for a condition that naturally worsens over time.Story continuesPer Nevro's management, the latest data indicating the long-term efficacy of Nevro HFX to treat people suffering from PDN worldwide is encouraging as high-frequency 10 kHz SCS demonstrated greater pain reduction and higher responder rates over time, unlike previous studies assessing traditional low-frequency systems for these patients.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Market Data Forecast, the global SCS market was estimated to be $2207 million in 2023 and is anticipated to reach $3334 million by 2028 at a CAGR of 8.6%. Factors like rising cases of chronic and neuropathic pain and the growing adoption of SCS therapy are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the publication of the latest positive data is expected to significantly boost Nevro’s business.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, Nevro announced the launch of HFX Connect in Europe to deliver comprehensive, life-changing solutions for treating chronic pain. The company also announced the receipt of the CE mark for label expansion of the HFX SCS system to include PDN and non-surgical back pain.The same month, Nevro reported its second-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered a solid improvement in overall top-line results and robust domestic and international revenues. An uptick in total U.S. permanent implant procedures and U.S. trial procedures was also recorded. An improvement in U.S. PDN trial procedures was also witnessed.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 60.1% in the past year compared with the industry’s 4.5% decline. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed a 3.8% growth in the said time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Nevro carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Patterson Companies, Inc.

It is seeing a strong customer uptake of RED 72 (with the proprietary SENDit technology), RED 43 and BMX81. These products represent significant advances in both the trackability of 0.072-sized aspiration catheters as well as distal clot removal. According to Penumbra, coupled with the recently launched BMX81, these products will continue to increase the company’s growth and market share in Neuro, particularly as physicians continue to realize the trade-off with oversized aspiration catheters in the market in the past several years.In the second quarter 2023, the revenues were up 23.8% year-over-year driven by new products in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific.Raised Guidance: Penumbra expects net sales in the range of $1.05-$1.07 billion, implying a 24-26% improvement year over year.

Medtronic surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 1.57%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlaySimilar to the last reported quarter, Medtronic's business is expected to have registered growth led by procedure volume recovery, supply improvements, and innovative product introductions.Within the Cardiovascular segment’s cardiac rhythm management, Medtronic’s pacing business continues to outperform the market banking on strong global growth of its Micra leadless pacemaker family as it enters new geographies and expands penetration in existing markets. In May 2023, Medtronic received FDA approval for Micra AV2 and VR2, which extend the battery life by 40% to a projected 16 and 17 years, respectively. ICDs (Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) within cardiac rhythm management are gaining in terms of market share following the latest CE Mark for the Aurora Extravascular ICD. We believe these developments to have boosted the company’s first-quarter revenues.Per our model, we project the Medtronic Cardiovascular segment to register growth of 1.9% in Q1.Within Medtronic’s Neuroscience portfolio, the Cranial Spinal technologies business registered robust growth in recent quarters. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the company's acquisition of Intersect ENT within the Specialty Therapies division in the Neuroscience portfolio contributed positively. We expect these trends to have continued through the fiscal first quarter, thus adding to the top line.Per our model, we project Medtronic’s Neuroscience segment to register growth of 1.5% in the fiscal first quarter.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise Medtronic PLC Price and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC price-eps-surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteStory continues Within Medtronic’s MedSurg portfolios, the rollout of differentiated Hugo robotic system in many international markets and the United States will likely drive the company’s revenue within the segment in the to-be-reported quarter.  Further, the AI-enabled surgical planning platform for patient-specific spine implants and robotic technologies worldwide are increasingly attracted to Medtronic’s differentiated and innovative solutions. This is expected to have contributed to the company’s growth in fiscal Q1 2024.Per our model, we project Medtronic’s MedSurg segment to register growth of 5.7% in Q1.In Diabetes, MDT might have faced some competitive pressure in the United States, where Medtronic lacks the latest products due to regulatory complications. However, the company is expected to have seen significant growth in markets outside the United States of the increasing user base of the MiniMed 780G insulin pump, combined with the Guardian 4 sensor.According to our model, Medtronic’s overall Diabetes is expected to decline 0.2% in Q1.Q1 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medtronic’s fiscal first-quarter total revenues of $7.57 billion suggests a 2.7% rise from the prior-year reported number. The consensus mark for earnings of $1.11 per share implies a 1.8% increase from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Medtronic this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Medtronic has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value that the stock should ideally be traded at. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor.

Masco has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.12, which ranks worse than 85.48% of companies in the Construction industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Masco's financial strength as 5 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.Is Masco Corp (MAS) Fairly Valued?

Overall, GuruFocus ranks Masco's profitability as strong.Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing, the company usually creates value for its shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable.

The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Masco's ROIC was 30.45, while its WACC came in at 8.52.Is Masco Corp (MAS) Fairly Valued?

Rising investment income, a strong CareCredit Platform and prudent strategic partnerships are driving the company.Headquartered in Stamford, CT, Synchrony Financial offers a wide range of credit products and consumer installment loans for a diverse group of clients. It currently has a market cap of $13.7 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCan SYF Retain Momentum?The answer is yes, and before we get into the details, let us show you where this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s main estimates for 2023 stand.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share currently stands at $4.96, which increased by 2 cents over the past week. During this time, it has witnessed three upward estimate revisions against none in the opposite direction. SYF beat earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters and missed once, with an average surprise of 5.7%.The consensus mark for 2023 revenues is pegged at $16.9 billion, predicting 8% growth from the 2022 level, with the support of rising active accounts and loan receivables. Elevated benchmark rates are also likely to boost its results.Our estimate for total period-end loan receivables for 2023 indicates a 10.6% year-over-year increase. Further, we expect average active accounts to increase almost 2% this year. The Health and Wellness platform is expected to be a major contributor to the upside. SYF’s focus on expanding the CareCredit brand is likely to support in this regard.The company’s consistent efforts to strike new deals, create partnerships and expand old ones are expected to position the company for long-term growth. Even in the past few months, it created new partnerships and deals, including entities like Floor &amp; Décor, Independence American Insurance Company, Nextech, Miracle-Ear and others. It also renewed tie-ups with companies like CCA Global Partners, JTV, The Container Store and others.Story continuesThe list of Synchrony Financial’s partners is continually rising, with more than 30 partners being added or relationships being renewed in the first half of 2023 alone. These moves are likely to enhance and diversify SYF’s revenue base, which is crucial during volatile economic times.RisksDespite the upside potential, there are a few factors that investors should keep an eye on.While the high interest rate environment is good for SYF’s investment income, it is likely to affect consumers’ spending levels. Also, losses are expected to build up on cards. The company estimates net charge-offs to average loans for 2023 to lie between 4.75 and 4.90%, which indicates a significant increase from the 2022 level of 3%. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive long-term growth.Key PicksInvestors interested in the broader finance space may look at players like Globe Life Inc.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 88% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Mastercard. Check out our latest analysis for Mastercard ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Mastercard?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Mastercard. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Mastercard's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Mastercard. The MasterCard Foundation, Endowment Arm is currently the largest shareholder, with 10% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.9% and 7.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 19 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of MastercardThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Mastercard Incorporated in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$394m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in Mastercard. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -8.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, which Qualcomm falls in, has lost 8.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $1.91 per share, indicating a change of -39% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.6% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.30 points to a change of -33.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.5%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.15 indicates a change of +10.2% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Qualcomm is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate of $8.51 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -25.3%. The $35.69 billion and $37.13 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -19.3% and +4.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryQualcomm reported revenues of $8.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -22.7%. EPS of $1.87 for the same period compares with $2.96 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.51 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.72%. The EPS surprise was +3.31%.Over the last four quarters, Qualcomm surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Qualcomm is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

LMT recently clinched a contract to provide program management, non-recurring unique requirements and training for supporting the integration efforts of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The contract will serve the government of Germany under Foreign Military Sales.The deal has been awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. Valued at $622.4 million, the contract is expected to be complete by December 2027. The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed has a significant presence in the global military aircraft sector, largely due to its F-35 Lightning II fleet. The jet is considered to be one of the most advanced and versatile aircraft, and due to its diverse capabilities in air warfare, ground attack and reconnaissance, it enjoys strong and consistent demand worldwide. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Considering the solid demand for this multi-variant stealth aircraft, the F-35 Lightning II fleet is the major contributor to LMT’s Aeronautics business segment. Its strong demand can also be gauged from its delivery numbers. In the second quarter of 2023, LMT delivered 45 aircraft and ended the quarter with a backlog of 421 aircraft.LMT’s continuous efforts to upgrade the model to match the evolving needs of military missions are likely to result in a steady inflow of orders for the company, like the latest one. Going forward, the company expects to deliver between 100 and 120 aircraft in 2023. This should continue to boost LMT’s revenues in the days ahead.Peer ProspectsPer the report from the Coherent Market Insights firm, the global military aircraft market is poised to witness a CAGR of 5.4% over the 2022-2030 period. This should benefit Lockheed as the company enjoys a dominant position in the military aircraft market with its portfolio containing combat-proven jets like F-16 and F-35 Fighter Aircraft.Story continuesOther defense companies that may enjoy the perks of the expanding military aircraft market are as follows:Boeing BA: The company is a prominent jet maker and enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.

Instead, they are forecasting a slight increase.""We are revising our home price forecasts higher, to 1.8% for full-year 2023 vs. -2.2% prior, and 3.5% in 2024 vs. 2.8% prior,"" Vinay Viswanathan, a fixed income strategist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note for the firm's housing team. “These forecasts imply home prices will remain roughly unchanged through [the] year-end and then return to trend growth levels in 2024.”This comes as home prices have resumed an upward trend and mortgage rates remain elevated, creating a bleak homeownership situation for many Americans. Goldman Sachs analysts previously thought that higher mortgage rates would put more downward pressure on home prices.After declining month over month for seven straight months late last year and into 2023, home prices reversed course in February have stayed that way through May, the latest month for which there is data from Case-Shiller's national price index.Craig Lazzara, managing director at S&amp;P DJI, said the data backs the case that the final month of monthly declines was in January.There are two key drivers supporting home prices, Viswanathan wrote.First, housing supply remains tight. The share of available existing homes for sale is around 1 million now, while that inventory was closer to 2 million homes before the pandemic, according to data from the National Association of Realtors data cited by Goldman.At the same time, while the supply of new homes continues to increase as builders step up their construction plans, ""most of this new inventory is still under construction,"" Viswanathan noted. ""New completions, on the other hand, remain below pre-COVID levels.""Housing starts for new single-family units increased by 6.7% in July from the month prior, according to the Census Bureau data out Wednesday, while completions registered a smaller 1.3% gain.Story continuesSecond, demand for housing remains stronger than expected.Based on the firm's housing affordability index hitting record lows, the Goldman Sachs analysts expected that home prices would need to decline nationwide before buyers would bite. But that conclusion has changed.""We trace most of this demand to non-economic sources: household formation and seasonal turnover,"" Viswanathan wrote. ""While high frequency data suggests housing turnover may moderate, household formation is well above its long-term trend.""Housing Affordability Index hit the lowest level on record this week (Source: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research)Housing affordability has worsened over the past year due to high mortgage rates, with the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage climbing north of 7% in the past week, Freddie Mac reported. While so far many homebuyers have swallowed these increased costs, they ""demonstrated behavior that, in our view, reflects unsustainable adaptations to elevated mortgage rates,"" Goldman Sachs noted.For instance, the average debt-to-income ratio on conforming purchase mortgages is over 38%, ""a significant aberration from post-Global Financial Crisis averages,"" Viswanathan wrote.""In addition, smaller and lower price homes have seen stronger price growth than larger, higher-quality properties. That said, we expect mortgage rates fall by 100 basis point through the end of next year, somewhat stabilizing affordability,"" Viswanathan wrote.A for sale sign stands outside a home on Nevada Avenue Thursday, June 22, 2023, in Colorado Springs, Colo.

The suit from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and several pharmaceutical companies, including Merck (MRK) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), is asking the courts to delay the implementation of a new law that would let Medicare negotiate the prices of certain drugs. Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani reports the details.Video Transcript- The legal battle over Medicare's drug pricing negotiations is heating up, and it could be heading to the Supreme Court. AARP opposing the Chamber of Commerce's request to delay the implementation of that part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani is following this story for us. Anj.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right, Seana. So AARP adding its name to the very short list, the only one so far to file an amicus brief on behalf of the health department and specifically, Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, who's been named in these lawsuits brought on by multiple pharma companies, as well as the US Chamber of Commerce and pharma, the large lobbying firm that represents all of the pharma companies.Now, it is, as you can see on your screen, a growing list on the against side. These companies asking for a delay in the implementation and also calling it unconstitutional. A number of these lawsuits name different amendments, including the First, Fifth, Eighth, as well as Ninth and 10th in some instances, saying that the implementation of the rule would be taking away free speech by forcing at the end of the day these companies to sign on after a brief negotiation period.As well as the Fifth Amendment, saying that it's an excessive-- sorry, government seizing property by taking the drugs at a negotiated price that they're, quote unquote, being forced to take. And then the Eighth Amendment being cited as excess tax in the fines that these companies would face for noncompliance according to Medicare.Story continuesSo all of this put together is really setting up the stage for possibly a long, drawn out battle. Bloomberg just reporting today that legal experts do say it could head to the Supreme Court, especially because of that use of the Fifth Amendment and specifically calling it unconstitutional. So it will be certainly an interesting one to watch.AARP saying that the delay on this rule could really harm patients, especially those who need the lifesaving drugs at lower prices, they said so in their filing. And they're looking at what else can be done there. This battle really is not over. We do expect likely more companies who are weighing their timing of entry, as well as other organizations that could file also on behalf for the Medicare pricing negotiations. So all within the timeline. We know that 2026 is that starting period. So time is starting to count down.- Certainly is. All right. Anjalee Khemlani, thanks so much for that update.]"

111,53b47260-a384-3b9d-8264-ac569fa47137,JNJ,2023-08-19,Kenvue Is a Timely Stock,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kenvue-timely-stock-173227448.html,1692379947,STORY,"['KVUE', 'JNJ']","[Kenvue Inc. (NYSE:KVUE), the consumer products division of health care giant Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), will fully separate from its parent next week as the company distributes the roughly 90% of the shares it currently holds to its shareholders that have decided to take exchange. The company decided to go for the split off route rather than the more common spinoff route in separating out Kenvue. This means shareholders will have had to tender in the Johnson &amp; Johnson shares via their brokers they want to exchange for Kenvue shares. The exchange is expected to be tax free for the shareholders as the same shareholders are simply exchanging shares for shares and there is no money and capital gains involved.Final exchange ratio and expectationsWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with KVUE. Click here to check it out. KVUE 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of KVUEJohnson &amp; Johnson announced on Aug. 16 that it has determined the final exchange ratio. For each share of Johnson &amp; Johnson common stock, it will deliver 8.0324 shares of Kenvue common stock. This is very close to the cap for the exchange (8.05 Kenvue shares per J&amp;J share) the company had established prior to the exchange announcement.Based on the final exchange ratio, Johnson &amp; Johnson currently expects to accept for exchange approximately 190,955,436 shares of common stock if the exchange offer is fully subscribed. The exchange offer is currently scheduled to expire at the end of the day on Aug. 18. Observers expect the offer to be over-subscribed as the company was offering a 7% discount for Kenvue shares in order to incentivize shareholders to take up the offer.Implications of the split for Johnson &amp; JohnsonBasically, I see this as a complicated way for Johnson &amp; Johnson to buy back its own stock as the number of shares outstanding will go down as it off-loads Kenvue. The company clearly want to focus on its higher growth and more profitable pharma and medtech business, where it has a dominant position. While its consumer business is quite large, the industry itself does not have growth characteristics. The industry itself is slow growth.Story continuesImpact on KenvueJ&amp;J is off-loading the Kenvue Inc (NYSE:KVUE) business at a forward PE of around 17 for a business which is basically flat to low single digit growth. J&amp;J had decided that it does not want to be in a flattish growth business. Kenvue also benefits as it gains a shareholder base which wants to own its stock (given that they had to actively and consciously exchange their J&amp;J stock). Normally in a spin-off situation many shareholders do not want to own the stock and the spun-off shares are then dumped into the market thus creating selling pressure before fundamental kick in. However because J&amp;J went the split off route rather than the spin-off route the selling pressure had started after the exchange offer was announced and should abate when the exchange deadline ends.Arbitrage opportunity and stock dynamicsBecause of the 7% discount built into the exchange offer, I believe traders have been buying Johnson &amp; Johnson stock and shorting Kenvue stock to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity. This can be seen in the price action of both stocks. While Johnson &amp; Johnson is up about 7% from Kenvue's debut on May 4, Kenvue is down about 17%. I expect this dynamic to reverse in the coming weeks as arbitragers sell J&amp;J shares and buy Kenvue shares to close out their positions.Kenvue Is a Timely StockFuture prospects for KenvueThe second catalyst I anticipate for Kenvue is that it will be joining the S&amp;P 500 index at a date that will be announced in the near future. This announcement should be coming any day now. This means the stock will experience buying pressure as indexes rejig their portfolio to accommodate Kenvue. Many pension funds and institutions which imitate the indexes will also buy the stock.ConclusionKenvue is an interesting short-term play. Because of the dynamics of the split off and the addition of the company into the S&amp;P 500, I expect the stock to rise in the short term. But this bounce will not last beyond three to six months. However, in the longer term, I think the stock is a little overvalued given its low growth profile. However, the company has a roster of strong brands (like Tylenol, Aveeno, Listerine, Neurogena, Johnson's etc.) and a steady business. I think a price-earnings ratio of about 12 to 15 is more appropriate for this company rather than the multiple of 17.5 it sports currently.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

But in any portfolio, there are likely to be some stocks that fall short of that benchmark. We regret to report that long term Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 17% in three years, versus a market return of about 27%.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the three years that the share price fell, Medtronic's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 7.5% each year. This fall in the EPS is worse than the 6% compound annual share price fall. This suggests that the market retains some optimism around long term earnings stability, despite past EPS declines.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Medtronic's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Medtronic's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Medtronic's TSR for the last 3 years was -11%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveMedtronic shareholders are down 11% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 3.4%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 0.7% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Medtronic that you should be aware of before investing here.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

There was no specific comment on Medtronic's device.ReCor's device, a balloon-like structure inside a catheter, is inserted through a small cut into the kidney's arteries and sends ultrasound energy to burn nerves that are believed to control blood pressure.On the other hand, Medtronic's device is a spiral shaped catheter and generator combination that uses targeted radiofrequency energy to destroy select nerves.The devices are meant for patients whose hypertension, or high blood pressure, cannot be controlled with drugs.These devices have successfully met the main goal of reducing blood pressure as their makers re-designed their trials and reconstituted their patient groups after earlier tests failed. Details on the patient group were not available.Needham analysts expect the devices might see limited sales for the first few years as the companies take time to build a market.According to Medtronic, the market size could reach $500 million by 2026 and $2 billion to $3 billion by 2030.The FDA advisers will meet on Tuesday to discuss ReCor's device and convene the day after to deliberate on rival Medtronic's equipment.

Medtronic surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 1.57%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlaySimilar to the last reported quarter, Medtronic's business is expected to have registered growth led by procedure volume recovery, supply improvements, and innovative product introductions.Within the Cardiovascular segment’s cardiac rhythm management, Medtronic’s pacing business continues to outperform the market banking on strong global growth of its Micra leadless pacemaker family as it enters new geographies and expands penetration in existing markets. In May 2023, Medtronic received FDA approval for Micra AV2 and VR2, which extend the battery life by 40% to a projected 16 and 17 years, respectively. ICDs (Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) within cardiac rhythm management are gaining in terms of market share following the latest CE Mark for the Aurora Extravascular ICD. We believe these developments to have boosted the company’s first-quarter revenues.Per our model, we project the Medtronic Cardiovascular segment to register growth of 1.9% in Q1.Within Medtronic’s Neuroscience portfolio, the Cranial Spinal technologies business registered robust growth in recent quarters. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the company's acquisition of Intersect ENT within the Specialty Therapies division in the Neuroscience portfolio contributed positively. We expect these trends to have continued through the fiscal first quarter, thus adding to the top line.Per our model, we project Medtronic’s Neuroscience segment to register growth of 1.5% in the fiscal first quarter.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise Medtronic PLC Price and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC price-eps-surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteStory continues Within Medtronic’s MedSurg portfolios, the rollout of differentiated Hugo robotic system in many international markets and the United States will likely drive the company’s revenue within the segment in the to-be-reported quarter.  Further, the AI-enabled surgical planning platform for patient-specific spine implants and robotic technologies worldwide are increasingly attracted to Medtronic’s differentiated and innovative solutions.

117,301f134f-af98-3f99-adf7-705600ad0fb1,MRK,2023-08-19,AARP urges courts to keep drug pricing talks on track,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/aarp-urges-courts-keep-drug-201114251.html,1692389474,VIDEO,"['BMY', 'MRK', 'JNJ']","[AARP is one of the few groups so far to have filed an amicus brief on supporting of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The suit from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and several pharmaceutical companies, including Merck (MRK) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), is asking the courts to delay the implementation of a new law that would let Medicare negotiate the prices of certain drugs. Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani reports the details.Video Transcript- The legal battle over Medicare's drug pricing negotiations is heating up, and it could be heading to the Supreme Court. AARP opposing the Chamber of Commerce's request to delay the implementation of that part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani is following this story for us. Anj.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right, Seana. So AARP adding its name to the very short list, the only one so far to file an amicus brief on behalf of the health department and specifically, Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, who's been named in these lawsuits brought on by multiple pharma companies, as well as the US Chamber of Commerce and pharma, the large lobbying firm that represents all of the pharma companies.Now, it is, as you can see on your screen, a growing list on the against side. These companies asking for a delay in the implementation and also calling it unconstitutional. A number of these lawsuits name different amendments, including the First, Fifth, Eighth, as well as Ninth and 10th in some instances, saying that the implementation of the rule would be taking away free speech by forcing at the end of the day these companies to sign on after a brief negotiation period.As well as the Fifth Amendment, saying that it's an excessive-- sorry, government seizing property by taking the drugs at a negotiated price that they're, quote unquote, being forced to take. And then the Eighth Amendment being cited as excess tax in the fines that these companies would face for noncompliance according to Medicare.Story continuesSo all of this put together is really setting up the stage for possibly a long, drawn out battle. Bloomberg just reporting today that legal experts do say it could head to the Supreme Court, especially because of that use of the Fifth Amendment and specifically calling it unconstitutional. So it will be certainly an interesting one to watch.AARP saying that the delay on this rule could really harm patients, especially those who need the lifesaving drugs at lower prices, they said so in their filing. And they're looking at what else can be done there. This battle really is not over. We do expect likely more companies who are weighing their timing of entry, as well as other organizations that could file also on behalf for the Medicare pricing negotiations. So all within the timeline. We know that 2026 is that starting period. So time is starting to count down.- Certainly is. All right. Anjalee Khemlani, thanks so much for that update.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read Goldman Sachs Dividend Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.Investors love dividend stocks because they are reliable and often a refuge during tough times when the economy and markets are wavering. More importantly, dividends have a strong history of keeping up with inflation. In the US, companies that provide dividends usually perform better during times of high inflation and increasing interest rates compared to non-dividend payers. Additionally, they're often seen as safer choices, declining less than the overall market during downturns. This defensive quality is especially significant in the current unpredictable circumstances. Since 1926, dividends have represented nearly one-third of the stock market’s overall returns.Dividend stocks experienced a slight drop this year as other asset classes began to catch the interest of investors. This doesn't mean that dividend stocks have lost their appeal, as their demand remains steady regardless of the economic situation. In one of our previous articles on dividend investing we cited data from Fidelity Investments, which mentioned that dividends made over half of the market's gains in high inflationary periods. The study also highlighted specific periods, like the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, where dividends accounted for 67%, 44%, and 73% of market gains, respectively. These decades saw inflation averaging above 5%, and overall returns were less than 10%.Also read: Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 12 Stock PicksEarlier this year, David Kostin, a Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist, gave an optimistic view regarding dividend stocks. He expects a 5% increase in dividend payments from S&amp;P 500 companies this year, with the potential for further growth. Here are some comments from the analyst:""We expect that S&amp;P 500 DPS [dividend-per-share] will reach $70 in 2023 and $73 (+4%) in 2024. Recent company actions also point to a healthy dividend growth environment. The difference in outlooks for dividend and buyback growth suggests firms focusing on dividends will continue to outperform buyback stocks.""Story continuesHe further mentioned that investors often consider companies that have long dividend growth histories because such companies are often financially sound, with the ability to generate sustained profits. By continuously boosting dividends, these companies prioritize providing returns to their shareholders, appealing to those seeking stable income and potential capital appreciation.In this article, we will discuss the top dividend stocks in Goldman Sachs's portfolio.

The Air Force hopes to begin buying a next-generation tanker in the mid-2030s and has its eyes on designs that could offer greater range and stealth needed in the Asia-Pacific.While military contracts could offer JetZero a chance to break into aircraft production, it also eyes a much-touted gap in the civil market between medium- and long-haul jets, where its 200-250 seat aircraft will sit, CEO Tom O'Leary said.Boeing abandoned a ""middle of the market"" plane project in 2022, saying the case did not work. Airbus has focused on expanding smaller models.In an interview, O'Leary said this would not deter JetZero and its radical design.""We're beginning conversations with all of the airlines and finding out what their appetite is for aircraft in the middle market,"" he told Reuters.""There's been universal interest and appeal because they're all interested in fuel efficiency and emissions reductions.""Two people familiar with the process said the Air Force, anxious to take advantage of higher volume and lower costs, had insisted bidders included a civil design when bidding.NORTHROP PARTNERStory continuesJetZero's partner Northrop Grumman will manufacture the demonstrator.That taps Northrop's pedigree in so-called flying-wing stealth bombers - an even more radical bat-wing design - though analysts say civil success depends on meeting goals of reliability very different from military jets.Northrop's B-2, the world's first stealth bomber, fired the opening shots of the 1999 Kosovo war, while its newly-revealed B-21 successor also incorporates a bat-winged design.The Air Force said materials and manufacturing advances have made production more attainable.However, blended wing designs have not yet garnered significant support in civil markets. Airbus dropped the concept from candidates for a small hydrogen-powered plane for 2035. It has not ruled out another look later.While range and payload make a blended wing body optimal for a freighter or tanker, an airliner is ""trickier"" because of logistical constraints at airports and difficulties of scaling families of jets, said Bank of America analyst Ron Epstein.One thing that would not radically change is engines.Whereas Boeing aimed to commission new engines for its abandoned project, JetZero says aerodynamic savings allow it to exploit existing models.The demonstrator will be powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney's Geared Turbofan used by Airbus. A decision has not been taken on eventual production models.Capital Alpha Partners analyst Byron Callan said the decision to back JetZero suggested Air Force ""frustration"" with traditional aerospace companies' use of cash to favor shareholders rather than bigger developmental risks.""One way to potentially change behaviors is to award contracts to smaller firms like JetZero,"" he wrote.(Reporting by Valerie Insinna and Tim Hepher; Editing by Mark Potter)]"

LMT recently clinched a contract to provide program management, non-recurring unique requirements and training for supporting the integration efforts of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The contract will serve the government of Germany under Foreign Military Sales.The deal has been awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. Valued at $622.4 million, the contract is expected to be complete by December 2027. The majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed has a significant presence in the global military aircraft sector, largely due to its F-35 Lightning II fleet. The jet is considered to be one of the most advanced and versatile aircraft, and due to its diverse capabilities in air warfare, ground attack and reconnaissance, it enjoys strong and consistent demand worldwide. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Considering the solid demand for this multi-variant stealth aircraft, the F-35 Lightning II fleet is the major contributor to LMT’s Aeronautics business segment. Its strong demand can also be gauged from its delivery numbers. In the second quarter of 2023, LMT delivered 45 aircraft and ended the quarter with a backlog of 421 aircraft.LMT’s continuous efforts to upgrade the model to match the evolving needs of military missions are likely to result in a steady inflow of orders for the company, like the latest one. Going forward, the company expects to deliver between 100 and 120 aircraft in 2023. This should continue to boost LMT’s revenues in the days ahead.Peer ProspectsPer the report from the Coherent Market Insights firm, the global military aircraft market is poised to witness a CAGR of 5.4% over the 2022-2030 period. This should benefit Lockheed as the company enjoys a dominant position in the military aircraft market with its portfolio containing combat-proven jets like F-16 and F-35 Fighter Aircraft.Story continuesOther defense companies that may enjoy the perks of the expanding military aircraft market are as follows:Boeing BA: The company is a prominent jet maker and enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.

Shares of drug distributors like McKesson (MCK), AmerisourceBergen (ABC), and Cardinal Health (CAH) each fell more than 2%.But analysts say the reality of the announcement is less severe than the market's initial reaction suggested.""Thursday was a unique 'perfect storm' of news that likely had a bigger impact on sentiment than it will in setting precedent,"" wrote UBS analyst Kevin Caliendo in a note, adding the selloff Thursday was ""nonsensical.""The Blues insurer, which is responsible for about 5 million members in California and posts $24 billion in annual revenue, is unbundling its PBM service and doling out portions to disruptors like Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs and Amazon Pharmacy (AMZN).The move, according to Blue Shield, will save $500 million on medications annually— a number CEO Paul Markovich told Yahoo Finance he is confident will be achieved.""We're creating a different mouse trap here. We've done the math,"" Markovich said.Under the new arrangement, Cost Plus Drugs will be responsible for generics and Amazon will take on the mail order business. Puerto Rico-based Abarca Health will manage claims and Prime Therapeutics, a PBM jointly owned by 19 Blues plans which works with partners like Walgreens (WBA) and Cigna's Express Scripts, will handle drug pricing negotiations.The shift will take effect starting in 2024 when Blue Shield's contract with CVS, which has been in place since 2021, ends.However, CVS will maintain the most profitable segment: specialty pharmacy. That, according to analysts, is the reason the announcement isn't all doom and gloom for the Big 3 PBMs — CVS, Cigna, and United Health Group.Story continues""[The] spectre of AMZN will likely negatively impact sentiment for the group, again,"" JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill wrote in a note on Thursday. ""However, we think the announcement actually highlights the value of legacy PBMs and limitations of newer models as Blue Shield is keeping the fastest growing and largest portion of its drug spend with CVS.""Gill noted that generics typically represent only 15% of drug spend even though they represent a higher volume of spend, and specialty drugs continue to rise in cost and represent a pain point for large employers, as seen during the recent demand surge for branded weight loss drugs like Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy and Ozempic, and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Mounjaro.""Per Cost Plus's page, the company has over 1,000 generic medications available but almost no branded drugs. Although the company seeks to add more branded drugs, it appears to be focusing only on specialty drugs that can be delivered via mail order,"" Gill said.In addition, mail order prescriptions have not taken over in-person pickups, despite a surge seen during the pandemic, so there is little concern about Amazon's share of the new arrangement, analysts said.Some are concerned about the customer experience with the complex makeup of PBMs.""Coordinating five vendors is like an average Tuesday for us,"" Markovich said.He added that despite the criticism, Blue Shield is going to be sticking to the unbundled model long-term, even though it is likely the combination of players changes in the future.A sign marks a CVS branch on May 16 in Pasadena, Calif. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)'Hard to replicate'The announcement from California Blue Shield on Thursday also isn't the first time an insurer has tried such a move.""Health plans have a mixed track record of separating or in-sourcing PBM functions,"" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note Friday. ""This decision by a large health plan will keep scrutiny on PBM economics and attention on proposed legislative changes, though we see the stock reactions as disproportionate relative to the likely implications.""""Historically, the value of scale offered by the Big 3 PBMs has been difficult to replicate,"" the firm added.Craig Garthwaite, a health economist and director of the Program on Healthcare at the Kellogg School at Northwestern University, told Yahoo Finance he's willing to bet the savings California Blue Shield ends up seeing isn't actually $500 million.""There's got to be a belief (by Blue Shield) that there's $500 million per year in excessive, unwarranted profit that the PBM is taking. I just don't believe that's true,"" Garthwaite said.The fact that CVS has been able to keep the profitable specialty pharmacy business also bolsters the unpopular opinion that the Big 3 serve a purpose. Garthwaite said this move runs counter to the idea that ""PBM executives are these monopolous fat cats lighting cigars with hundred dollar bills. It's not that. They actually do things that matter to people.""He also noted that CVS could respond by increasing the cost of the business segment it is keeping in the new contract with Blue Shield.Markovich said anything is possible, but the contracts are in place and renegotiating them could be a breach.The plan has been in the works for more than two years, with a lengthy request for proposal process, which began just before the pandemic, he said.The announcement has excited watchers of health care industry trends, who anticipate other Blues and employer plans could emulate the strategy.""Almost every investor we spoke with felt the consortium hired by Blue Shield was risky at best to be able to execute on the new business,"" UBS's Caliendo wrote. ""We tend to agree, but also understand that this thesis is not likely to be proven anytime soon given timing on onboarding.""We do think the idea that PBM contracting will be increasingly 'unbundled'...perhaps leading to lower overall profits from purchasing, rebates, and couponing.""Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The move comes after CVS lost part of a contract with insurer Blue Shield of California, which has selected Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and a collection of other companies to take on the tasks of a pharmacy benefit manager.The analysts estimate that Cigna’s pharmacy benefit manager business contributed two-thirds of the insurer’s profit last year, and they noted that while it is just one contract for CVS, Blue Shield of California’s move highlights the growing competitive threat in the business.While Blue Shield of California’s multi-player model – for example Amazon will provide home delivery of drugs, while other companies will manage claims, and another will negotiate prices – rather than the familiar bundled approach will be complicated to implement. CVS will continue to provide Blue Shield of California with specialty drug services.But, the analysts said, the new model could weigh on CVS shares. “The BCS contract could also encourage customers to be more aggressive in negotiating future PBM contracts with industry players,” they wrote.Shares of Cigna closed up 2%, while shares of CVS were flat.For Cigna, the analysts pointed to opportunities in MedicareAdvantage and biosimilars, which are generic versions of complex injectable drugs. “The health insurance market is growing due to the expansion of MA, and we believe Cigna can increase marketshare,” they said.As for CVS, the analysts noted that it is also a diverse model, with a retail drugstore business, Aetna health insurance, specialty drug services, and patient care services. That is helping it transform into a one stop shop for health care.“Over the long term, this integrated strategy should lead to accelerating earnings growth for the company,” they said.Story continuesRelated ArticlesCigna, CVS Health downgraded on competition in pharmacy benefit manager businessJetZero looks beyond Pentagon to airlines with radical jetS&amp;P 500 ends near flat as energy, defensive sectors counter megacap declines]"

Meanwhile, EPS was ($0.21), compared to the consensus of ($0.28). For the full 2023 year, the company expects revenue of $2.5 billion, worse than the consensus estimate of $2.8B.According to KeyBanc, the rating change is based on decreased confidence in execution and the timeline to profitability. Factors such as macroeconomic challenges and a decline in Brand Platform GMV by 42% year-over-year had a negative impact on the quarter's results. Additionally, softened expectations for Reebok's performance, as well as year-over-year declines in the U.S. and China, increase the risk of achieving profitability in fiscal 2023.Though we view cost rationalization initiatives positively, we think reduced guidance implies a fairly tough 2H hurdle given softer trends.

This will take the dividend yield to an attractive 1.8%, providing a nice boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for TE Connectivity TE Connectivity's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Before making this announcement, TE Connectivity was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 35.6% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 28% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendTE Connectivity Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.84, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.36. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 11% over that duration. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that TE Connectivity has been growing its earnings per share at 14% a year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.We Really Like TE Connectivity's DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.

The Air Force hopes to begin buying a next-generation tanker in the mid-2030s and has its eyes on designs that could offer greater range and stealth needed in the Asia-Pacific.While military contracts could offer JetZero a chance to break into aircraft production, it also eyes a much-touted gap in the civil market between medium- and long-haul jets, where its 200-250 seat aircraft will sit, CEO Tom O'Leary said.Boeing abandoned a ""middle of the market"" plane project in 2022, saying the case did not work. Airbus has focused on expanding smaller models.In an interview, O'Leary said this would not deter JetZero and its radical design.""We're beginning conversations with all of the airlines and finding out what their appetite is for aircraft in the middle market,"" he told Reuters.""There's been universal interest and appeal because they're all interested in fuel efficiency and emissions reductions.""Two people familiar with the process said the Air Force, anxious to take advantage of higher volume and lower costs, had insisted bidders included a civil design when bidding.Northrop partnerJetZero's partner Northrop Grumman will manufacture the demonstrator.Story continuesThat taps Northrop's pedigree in so-called flying-wing stealth bombers - an even more radical bat-wing design - though analysts say civil success depends on meeting goals of reliability very different from military jets.Northrop's B-2, the world's first stealth bomber, fired the opening shots of the 1999 Kosovo war, while its newly-revealed B-21 successor also incorporates a bat-winged design.The Air Force said materials and manufacturing advances have made production more attainable.However, blended wing designs have not yet garnered significant support in civil markets. Airbus dropped the concept from candidates for a small hydrogen-powered plane for 2035. It has not ruled out another look later.While range and payload make a blended wing body optimal for a freighter or tanker, an airliner is ""trickier"" because of logistical constraints at airports and difficulties of scaling families of jets, said Bank of America analyst Ron Epstein.One thing that would not radically change is engines.Whereas Boeing aimed to commission new engines for its abandoned project, JetZero says aerodynamic savings allow it to exploit existing models.The demonstrator will be powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney's Geared Turbofan used by Airbus. A decision has not been taken on eventual production models.Capital Alpha Partners analyst Byron Callan said the decision to back JetZero suggested Air Force ""frustration"" with traditional aerospace companies' use of cash to favor shareholders rather than bigger developmental risks.""One way to potentially change behaviors is to award contracts to smaller firms like JetZero,"" he wrote.

With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of 30.14, the question arises: Is the stock fairly valued? In this article, we will delve into an in-depth analysis of Northrop Grumman's valuation. Read on to discover if this could be a worthwhile investment for you.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NOC. Click here to check it out. NOC 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NOCNorthrop Grumman is a leading defense contractor that offers a diversified portfolio of aeronautics, defense, mission, and space systems. The company's aerospace segment is responsible for the fuselage of the F-35 program and produces both autonomous and piloted aircraft. Its defense systems segment specializes in artillery and missile ammunition, guidance systems, and missile defense systems. The mission systems segment integrates radar, navigation, and communication systems for avionics, weapons control, and countermeasures. Finally, the space systems segment produces satellites, sensors, space structures, and manufactures long-range missiles and rocket motors.With a current share price of $436.65, it's important to compare this figure to the company's estimated fair value or GF Value. This will give us a clearer picture of whether the stock is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly valued.Is Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC) Stock Fairly Valued?Understanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of a stock's intrinsic value. It is based on three factors: historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded. If the stock price is significantly above or below the GF Value Line, it may be overvalued or undervalued, respectively.According to GuruFocus, Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is fairly valued. The stock's fair value is estimated based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. Conversely, if the stock price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have higher future returns. At its current price of $436.65 per share, Northrop Grumman stock is believed to be fairly valued.Story continuesBecause Northrop Grumman is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Is Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC) Stock Fairly Valued?Link: These companies may deliever higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy its stock. A good starting point for understanding a company's financial strength is to look at its cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. Northrop Grumman has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.22, which is worse than 68.47% of companies in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of Northrop Grumman at 6 out of 10, indicating that the company's financial strength is fair.Is Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC) Stock Fairly Valued?Profitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk. A company with high profit margins is also typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. Northrop Grumman has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $37.90 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $30.14. Its operating margin is 9.67%, which ranks better than 67.49% of companies in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks the profitability of Northrop Grumman at 9 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock.

With an unmatched passion that surrounds the sport, football has long had the capacity to link communities, stir powerful emotions, and even break down cultural barriers. Football has also become one of the most profitable industries with billions upon billions of dollars being generated every year.From the players and fans to sponsorships and TV rights, a lot of factors come into play to make football a very profitable business. Football as a sport has been around for generations and is enjoyed in many countries around the world. Previously, in the top 20 richest football leagues in the world, we looked at the most valuable football leagues in terms of value. In this piece, we will be looking at the 25 most valuable football clubs in the world. First, let’s take a look at the global football industry and the market in the US.Analysis of the Global Football IndustryPreviously, the COVID-19 crisis had negatively impacted the global sports industry as well as the football market because of closures and cancellations of several tournaments around the world. Sports stadiums all over the world were either shut down or left empty.However, post-COVID-19 crisis the market has been recovering. The success of the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar provided the global sports industry and the football market with a much needed boost. According to FIFA, the 2022 World Cup tournament was the most profitable in FIFA’s history where the ticketing program alone generated as much as $686 million in revenue.According to Research and Markets, the global football market size was valued at $3.2 billion in 2022. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.79% during 2022-2028, propelling the market to reach $4 billion by the end of the forecasted period. The increasing passion for the sport has led to a surge in professional association football tournaments and leagues at different levels around the world. The growing awareness among individuals about the health benefits of playing football has resulted in an increased demand for football goods and products, which continues to influence the global football market positively. The emerging trend of physical fitness activities and the development of stadiums, parks, and clubs to encourage the participation of individuals in footballing events and outdoor games should further augment market growth.Story continuesWithout a doubt, Europe has the largest football market. According to Deloitte Football Money League 2023, 30 of the highest revenue generating clubs in world football were all from Europe. The huge number of famous football clubs combined with the increasing number of supporters and football participants positively influences the demand for football among all age groups. This provides an excellent opportunity for football manufacturing companies to grow their business in the region. Some of the biggest European Football Clubs are Manchester United PLC (NYSE:MANU), Borussia Dortmund (ETR:BVB), and Juventus FC (BIT:JUVE). On June 16, Reuters reported that English football club Manchester United PLC (NYSE:MANU) is negotiating to grant exclusivity to the consortium led by Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani, the son of Qatar's former prime minister who is one of the richest men in the Gulf state, in talks to sell itself for more than $6 billion. This would be one of the biggest ever deals in the sports world. On August 1, Reuters reported in another post that Manchester United PLC (NYSE:MANU) signed a $1.1 billion deal with Adidas AG (ETR:ADS) to renew the football club's partnership with its official kit supplier for 10 more years. The post also mentions that the club is still in talks to sell itself after its American owners, the Glazer family, launched a formal sale process late last year and mentions Qatar's Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani among the potential suitors for the club.According to a report by Transparency Market Research, the global Football Merchandise market was valued at $11.4 billion in 2022. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.5% during 2023-2031, to reach a value of $20 billion by the end of the forecasted period. Football fans are more enthusiastic about supporting their favorite players and teams. The rise in football fans around the world is driving the sales of football jerseys and other accessories to create a positive outlook for the market. Some of the key players in this market that are expected to benefit from the increased demand for football merchandise include NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Adidas AG (ETR:ADS), and Puma SE (ETR:PUM).Saudi League has also joined the race after signing a number of famous football stars from European Clubs. On August 10, Reuters reported that the Saudi Pro League will herald a new dawn for football in the Gulf kingdom which has spent close to half a billion dollars to lure some of the biggest names from Europe. The Saudi Pro League entered the spotlight when Cristiano Ronaldo signed for Al-Nassr last season in a deal which made him the highest-paid athlete on the planet. With so many big names coming to the Saudi Pro League, the demand for football merchandise is on the rise in the region. The hottest news right now in the football world is that the Brazilian star Neymar has joined the Saudi club Al-Hilal as the latest star signing of the Saudi Pro League. On August 15, Reuters reported that Neymar has signed a two-year contract at Saudi Arabia's Al-Hilal with a reported fee of $98.24 million. The interest around the Saudi Pro League looks set to reach yet another peak. The number of transfers, the money being offered to some of the biggest football stars highlights the ambition of the Saudi league to become one of the major competitions in the world in the coming years.Lionel Messi and the Market in the USFor decades the quality of football, or soccer, in the US was not at the same level of excellence domestically compared to European and even Latin American leagues. However, since the advent of Major League Soccer (MLS) in the 90s things have started to change. MLS has been growing its fan base steadily and the sport is quickly becoming a fan favorite in the US. Moreover, on June 9, Reuters reported that the MLS announced what might as well be the most significant news since its foundation: the arrival of Lionel Messi, arguably one of the best football players to have ever played the sport and also the 2022 FIFA World Cup champion with Argentina.On August 10, Reuters reported that Lionel Messi’s move to Inter Miami could significantly raise the profile of MLS and of the sport as a whole in the US. Messi has brought with him a wave of devoted fans to the MLS and the league continues to draw attention from all around the world. The post also mentions that since the announcement of Messi's signing, there has been a huge surge in searches for match dates and tickets to see the Argentine play. Fans are also looking to buy Messi’s official pink Inter Miami shirt. The post also mentions that in 2022, Apple TV (NASDAQ:AAPL) and MLS announced a 10 year partnership and with Messi’s arrival, the MLS's viewership is also expected to skyrocket.Here are some comments from Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Q3 2023 earnings call that discuss more on this:“In the few years since its launch, Apple TV+ has earned more than 1,500 nominations and 370 wins. That includes the 54 Emmy Award nominations across 13 titles that Apple TV+ received last month. It's also been an exciting time for sports on Apple TV+. Soccer legend Lionel Messi made his debut with Major League Soccer last month, and fans all over the world tuned in with MLS Season Pass. We are excited about our MLS partnership, and we're thrilled to see Messi suiting up with Inter Miami.”On July 18, CNBC reported that Jorge Mas, managing owner of Inter Miami, said that the arrival of Messi is expected to double the club’s revenues over the next 12 months and that the team’s valuation could reach above $1.3 billion in the next year.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read Goldman Sachs Dividend Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.Investors love dividend stocks because they are reliable and often a refuge during tough times when the economy and markets are wavering. More importantly, dividends have a strong history of keeping up with inflation. In the US, companies that provide dividends usually perform better during times of high inflation and increasing interest rates compared to non-dividend payers. Additionally, they're often seen as safer choices, declining less than the overall market during downturns. This defensive quality is especially significant in the current unpredictable circumstances. Since 1926, dividends have represented nearly one-third of the stock market’s overall returns.Dividend stocks experienced a slight drop this year as other asset classes began to catch the interest of investors. This doesn't mean that dividend stocks have lost their appeal, as their demand remains steady regardless of the economic situation. In one of our previous articles on dividend investing we cited data from Fidelity Investments, which mentioned that dividends made over half of the market's gains in high inflationary periods. The study also highlighted specific periods, like the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, where dividends accounted for 67%, 44%, and 73% of market gains, respectively. These decades saw inflation averaging above 5%, and overall returns were less than 10%.Also read: Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 12 Stock PicksEarlier this year, David Kostin, a Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist, gave an optimistic view regarding dividend stocks. He expects a 5% increase in dividend payments from S&amp;P 500 companies this year, with the potential for further growth. Here are some comments from the analyst:""We expect that S&amp;P 500 DPS [dividend-per-share] will reach $70 in 2023 and $73 (+4%) in 2024. Recent company actions also point to a healthy dividend growth environment. The difference in outlooks for dividend and buyback growth suggests firms focusing on dividends will continue to outperform buyback stocks.""Story continuesHe further mentioned that investors often consider companies that have long dividend growth histories because such companies are often financially sound, with the ability to generate sustained profits. By continuously boosting dividends, these companies prioritize providing returns to their shareholders, appealing to those seeking stable income and potential capital appreciation.In this article, we will discuss the top dividend stocks in Goldman Sachs's portfolio.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Bank of America Corporation (BAC). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Apple shares have struggled lately, with the stock losing losing -11.6% of its value since the start of August, lagging the Zacks Tech sector's -7.3% decline and the S&amp;P 500 index's -4.6% pullback. This recent weakness notwithstanding, the stock has been a standout performer this year, handily outperforming the Tech sector as well as the broader market.  The company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade, as well as the launch of its high-yield savings account with Apple Card, helped in driving subscriber growth.Apple’s results also benefited from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption among enterprises. Apple expects iPhone and Services’ year-over-year growth to accelerate in fiscal fourth-quarter as compared with the June quarter.However, revenues for both Mac and iPad are expected to decline by double digits on a year-over-year basis due to difficult comparison. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt top-line.(You can read the full research report on Apple here &gt;&gt;&gt;)As is the case with Apple, NVIDIA shares have struggled lately as well, with the stock lagging the Tech sector as well as the S&amp;P 500 index this month (-9.4% vs. -7.3% for the Tech sector &amp; -4.6% for the index). That said, Nvidia's performance this year is one for the record books, with the stock up +192.9% this year vs. +32.7% for the Tech sector and +15.2% for the market. Story continuesNvidia has literally been in a league of its own since its last quarterly release on May 24th when it raised guidance by a magnitude that we have never seen from another company. With the company on deck to report results on Wednesday, August 23rd, it is under the spotlight as to whether the preceding quarter's numbers were a one-off or the start of a sustained period of outperformance. The company is gaining from strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute &amp; Networking revenues.A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.However, NVDA’s near-term prospects look gloomy due to weakening demand for chips used in gaming and professional visualization end markets. While macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and professional visualization chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Bank of America have underperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past six months (-10.9% vs. -15.9%). The tough economic backdrop is expected to keep weighing on investment banking (IB) business. This, along with the volatile nature of the capital markets, might hurt non-interest income.

140,f9049856-a251-365c-8492-83d095fb4bb4,WFC,2023-08-19,Brokers Suggest Investing in Wells Fargo (WFC): Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-wells-fargo-133007804.html,1692365407,STORY,['WFC'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Wells Fargo (WFC).Wells Fargo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.91, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 17 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.91 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 17 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 47.1% and 11.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for WFCBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for WFCCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Wells Fargo here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Wells Fargo, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in WFC?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Wells Fargo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.86.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Wells Fargo. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Wells Fargo.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Scientists are keeping an eye on the new lineage, named BA.2.86, because it has 36 mutations that distinguish it from the currently-dominant XBB.1.5 variant.So far there is no evidence that BA.2.86 spreads faster or causes more serious illness than previous versions. The CDC said its advice on protecting yourself from COVID remains the same.What is new about COVID?COVID infections and hospitalizations have been rising in the U.S., Europe and Asia, with more cases in recent months attributed to the EG.5 ""Eris"" subvariant, a descendant of the Omicron lineage that originally emerged in November 2021.Over the past few days, public health authorities have documented one case each of BA.2.86 in the United States, the UK, and Israel, and three cases in Denmark.What do scientists say about BA.2.86?BA.2.86 stems from an ""earlier branch"" of the coronavirus, so it differs from the variant targeted by current vaccines, explained Dr. S. Wesley Long, medical director of diagnostic microbiology at Houston Methodist Hospital.He said it remains to be seen whether BA.2.86 will be able to out-compete other strains of the virus or have any advantage in escaping immune responses from prior infection or vaccination.But many countries have drastically reduced testing of patients and their efforts to analyze the genomes of the viruses causing new COVID cases. In that situation, the trajectory of BA.2.86 ""doesn't look good right now,"" given the speed at which new cases are being identified, said Dr. Eric Topol, a genomics expert and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California.Its many mutations make BA.2.86 ""radically different in its structure"" compared to earlier variants, Topol said.Story continuesThe main question, he added, is whether BA.2.86 will turn out to be highly transmissible.Do the new variants make people sicker?U.S. emergency department visits and hospitalizations for COVID remain low, but have been rising since early July, according to data on the CDC website. So far, however, doctors have been reporting that patients seen in recent weeks, as the Eris variant has been spreading, are not as sick as those they treated during earlier waves of the pandemic.Wider spread of BA.2.86 would likely cause more illness and death in vulnerable populations, Topol said.It is too soon to know whether BA.2.86 will cause more-severe illness.""Based on the available evidence, we do not yet know what risks, if any, (BA.2.86) may pose to the public's health beyond what has been seen with other currently circulating lineages,"" a CDC spokesperson said.Will vaccines protect against new variants?Due to the waning of the pandemic, it may have been a year or more since many people were either previously infected or vaccinated against COVID.""The vaccine is still going to provide you great defense against illness and death,"" Long said.Updated COVID booster shots now being developed have been designed to target the Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5.Moderna said preliminary trial data suggest its latest version of the vaccine shows promise against Eris and a related variant called Fornax, which has begun to circulate in the U.S.Pfizer Inc has said its updated COVID-19 shot showed neutralizing activity against the Eris subvariant in a study conducted on mice.

Yet to be authorized by the FDA, mRNA-1273.815 is designed to target the XBB descendent lineage viruses.Recently designated by the World Health Organization (“WHO”) as a variant of interest, EG.5 (also known as ‘Eris’) is currently the dominant variant in the United States. Per the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), the variant is responsible for more than 17% of COVID-19 infections in the country.Infection cases from FL.1.5.1 (also known as ‘Fornax’) are growing in the United States. Based on the latest CDC data, Fornax accounted for 8.6% of all cases nationwide.At an FDA committee meeting held in June, Moderna presented clinical data that showed that mRNA-1273.815 generated robust neutralizing antibodies against the key circulating XBB strains.A regulatory filing is currently under the agency’s review seeking authorization for mRNA-1273.815. A final FDA decision is expected in the coming weeks for the vaccine’s launch for the upcoming fall season. A similar regulatory submission is also currently under review in Europe.Shares of Moderna have lost 40.9% year to date compared with the industry’s 13.6% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchManagement claims it has built an ample supply for mRNA-1273.815 and is ready to ship the same doses for the upcoming fall vaccination season, provided that the FDA authorizes the vaccine.Apart from Moderna, other COVID vaccine makers like Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX and Novavax NVAX have also updated their own vaccines to target the XBB lineages. During the FDA committee meeting held in June, Pfizer/BioNTech and Novavax also presented their pre-clinical findings supporting the use of their own vaccines that target the XBB.1.5 variant.Story continuesIn June, Pfizer and BioNTech submitted filings in Europe and the United States seeking approval for their Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. If approved, the companies intend to launch their vaccine for the fall season.Earlier this week, Reuters reported that Pfizer/BioNTech’s updated vaccine was effective against the Eris variant in a study conducted on mice. Pfizer/BioNTech expects to make their updated vaccine ready for supply immediately post-regulatory approvals.Alongside its second-quarter 2023 results, Novavax announced that it had initiated a filing with the FDA for its updated COVID vaccine and intends to submit one in Europe in the coming weeks. Novavax stated that it is manufacturing its protein-based monovalent XBB.1.5 COVID vaccine candidate at a commercial scale, intended to be in the market during the upcoming fall vaccination campaign.

Novartis’ NVS generics division, Sandoz announced positive data from a phase III study evaluating a biosimilar version of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ REGN EyleaRecap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesFDA Approves Pfizer’s Elranatamab for Multiple Myeloma: The FDA granted accelerated approval to Pfizer’s BCMA-CD3-targeted agent Elrexfio (elranatamab) for treating heavily pre-treated patients with RRMM). Continued approval of the drug will be based on verification of clinical benefit in a confirmatory study. The FDA’s approval of Elrexfio is based on data from the pivotal phase II MagnetisMM-3 study, which evaluated elranatamab in heavily pretreated patients with RRMM who received Elrexfio as their first BCMA-directed therapy. Data from the study showed early and deep responses and a manageable safety profile for elranatamab. Elranatamab’s marketing authorization application is also under review in the EU.FDA Approves J&amp;J’s Prostate Cancer Tablet Akeega: The FDA granted approval to J&amp;J’s Akeega, which is a combination of Zejula (niraparib) and abiraterone acetate, plus prednisone in the form of a dual action tablet, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA-positive mCRPC. The approval of Akeega is based on results from the phase III MAGNITUDE study. Data from the study showed that patients treated with Akeega plus prednisone achieved a reduction of 47% in radiographic progression-free survival compared to abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in patients with BRCA-positive mCRPC. Akeega was approved in the EU in April.Story continuesAbbVie’s Atogepant Gets EU Nod for Preventive Treatment of Migraine: The European Commission approved AbbVie’s CGRP receptor antagonist, Aquipta (atogepant) in Europe for prophylaxis (prevention) of migraine in adults who have four or more migraine days per month. This approval was based on results from two pivotal phase III studies, PROGRESS and ADVANCE, evaluating 60 mg dose strength of Aquipta/Qulipta in adult patients with chronic migraine or episodic migraine, respectively.Atogepant is already approved in the United States as Qulipta for the preventive treatment of both chronic and episodic migraine. With the latest approval in EU, Aquipta has become the first and only once-daily oral CGRP receptor antagonist to be approved for the preventive treatment of both chronic and episodic migraine in the European Union.Novartis’ Eylea Biosimilar Meets Goal in Study: Novartis unit Sandoz’s phase III study called Mylight, evaluating a biosimilar version of Regeneron’s blockbuster eye drug, Eylea (aflibercept), met its primary efficacy endpoint. It showed no clinically meaningful differences to the reference biologic, Eylea. The study showed therapeutic equivalence in mean change of best corrected visual acuity from baseline to week 8 between the biosimilar aflibercept and Eylea.Eylea is presently approved to improve visual acuity in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion and other specific neovascular retinal diseases.

""That said, you really have to de-average because the amount of turnover in, say, the S&amp;P 500 has remained relatively stable over the last five years, with the exception of 2022, where there was a decrease. In the S&amp;P 500, there was a significant increase throughout 2022 of external CEO hires.""The list of CEOs making their exits has grown massively in just the last week.After an extensive search, PayPal (PYPL) announced that CEO Dan Schulman's successor would be longtime Intuit executive Alex Chriss. Meanwhile, Synopsys (SNPS) revealed a CEO shift this week, as Aart de Geus steps aside at the chip design tools company, making way for Sassine Ghazi to become president and CEO.Kraft Heinz (KHC) CEO Miguel Patricio shocked the Street on Monday when he announced plans to step down. Patricio will be succeeded by insider US CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera. Also last week, coffee chain Dutch Bros (BROS) named Christine Barone, who has served as president of the company since February 2023, to replace Joth Ricci as CEO. Both leadership changes are effective Jan. 1 of next year.And in February, Restaurant Brands International (QSR) CEO José Cil announced the end of his term as chief executive and was replaced by insider Joshua Kobza.Dan Schulman, CEO of PayPal, delivers a keynote speech during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Febr. 22, 2016. (Albert Gea/REUTERS) (Albert Gea / Reuters)This turnover is happening in large part because of the macroeconomic and societal shifts that have happened as the worst of COVID-19 subsided, said London Business School professor Randall Peterson.""CEOs are changing over now because the situation has changed so dramatically in the last 18 months,"" he said. ""We went from super low interest rates, learning to work from home, and a Donald Trump world to the highest inflation in 40 years, people relearning to work in the presence of others, and Joe Biden’s very different style. What worked to get [companies] through COVID will not work now. We’ve had just long enough post COVID to really start seeing that.""Story continuesThese C-suite changes tend to mirror changes in the wider workforce.""In many cases, CEOs have taken very tough and necessary action to right-size their workforce and organizational structures,"" Keith Giarman, a managing partner at DHR Global, told Yahoo Finance. ""When you add all this up, coupled with the overarching workforce trend of prioritizing work-life balance, these impacts are being reflected on to the C-suite level as well. Is it any wonder CEOs are not necessarily geared up for the next iteration of the market, regardless of how much money we are paying them?""In particular, layoffs and CEO departures correlate over time, Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas senior vice president Andy Challenger said. Though ""it's not always exact,"" he said.""At the height of COVID, we saw huge numbers of layoffs, the highest we've ever seen, and we also saw very few CEO layoffs,"" Challenger explained. ""That was kind of one of those moments where the trends diverged. Companies didn't want to let go of their leaders in the crisis, but they were letting employees go.""""Now, we're seeing them much more highly correlated,"" he added, ""which I think is companies returning back to some sort of normalcy. ... They're bringing in leaders that are going to have a strategy that is going to work over this next period.""A man walks out through a propped-open door in New York City, New York, Sept. 23, 2019. (Yana Paskova/REUTERS) (Yana Paskova / reuters)It's not just CEOs who have been getting the boot lately. Companies are reshuffling their C-suites in all kinds of ways.For example, just this week Subway revealed Trevor Haynes, president of North America, would be leaving the company after almost two decades at the sandwich chain.But these sorts of shifts can make for risky times.""CEO change is always going to be a time of increased risk as new leaders tend to come in with less confidence than is ideal, and their priorities get reflected down the chain fairly quickly,"" Peterson said. ""If the organization or specific people are hungry for change, then this will be welcomed. If things have been going well, change can feel threatening to that success. So when you destabilize the most successful people, that is a risky time.""Still, a new board-chosen CEO can offer some insight into where companies want to go.There are benefits and drawbacks to choosing someone internally, as was the case at Kraft Heinz, or externally, as was the case at PayPal. External successors have grown increasingly common but don't always promise stability, BCG's Barton said.""In terms of the composition of internal to external hires, within the S&amp;P 500, we have seen material increases in external successors in 2018 and 2022,"" she told Yahoo Finance.""Over the last five years, the highest rates of external hires occurred in 2018 and 2019. This could reflect improvements in succession planning by smaller companies as well as the desire to maintain stability and experience in the role in the face of increasing external volatility, complexity, and expectations of CEOs.""In the case of Dutch Bros, Ricci said the CEO transition started before the company went public in 2021.""We were planning and executing the type of leadership and the leadership skill sets the company was going to need to really carry forward in the journey,"" Ricci said. ""Bringing Christine [Barone] on was natural. ... Over the five years, we've created something that's now on a national stage and took it public and managed COVID, and I'm just really proud of how full the cupboard is what we can do to put our leadership in a great position to succeed for the future.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Every one of those people was a vital contributor to the high standards of journalism that have made CoinDesk a household name in the world of crypto.They helped us win awards — a Polk award, a New York Press Club award and, just this week, a finalist listing for this year’s Loeb awards. They contributed to the best “play for each other” spirit I’ve ever encountered in a newsroom. They made working at CoinDesk exciting and rewarding. They are all, already, sorely missed. I wish them all the very best and hope that one day I have the pleasure of working with some or all of them again.You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.Also, another downer: This will be the last Money Reimagined for 2023. I’m putting the newsletter on hiatus to free up time to write a book – more details on that later – and to address the challenge of thinner staffing resources at CoinDesk. It will resume publication in January.My weekly Money Reimagined podcast, with Sheila Warren, will continue, however. This week, we feature a conversation with Frank McCourt, the construction magnate, philanthropist and founder of Project Liberty, an initiative aimed at fixing a broken internet. Frank, who is co-authoring the book mentioned above, makes the compelling point that decentralized storage solutions will allow society to break its toxic dependence on large, data-hogging internet platforms.This embedded content is not available in your region.And now for the main column of the week.What now for U.S. stablecoins?As a divided Congress readies to vote on – and quite possibly kill – a new bill that would regulate stablecoins, it’s worth reflecting on how far ahead of the U.S. other jurisdictions are in this process and what the United States’ laggard status might mean for the dollar’s place in the future of money.Story continuesThe Monetary Authority of Singapore this week released a new regulatory framework for stablecoins that, among other rules, imposes minimum capital requirements on issuers. Many see the new rules creating clarity and setting the generally crypto-friendly city-state up as a hub for these increasingly popular crypto payments instruments.Also from Singapore, but executed in Switzerland, former Singaporean parliamentarian Calvin Cheng launched stablecoins pegged to the Swiss franc and the euro, according to a press release Tuesday. His company, Anchored Coins, is incorporated in Zug and, as a licensed member of the country’s VQF self-regulatory organization, is authorized to issue the coins under regulations established by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or FINMA.The Bermuda Monetary Authority has had a licensing system for digital asset companies since 2018. In December 2022, it issued the island territory’s first license to Jewel Bank, allowing it to issue its dollar-backed stablecoin, JUSD.In Dubai, a set of stablecoin-issuance rules has existed since the formation of the Emirate’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) in March 2022.The Canadian Securities Administrators, an umbrella organization for Canada’s provincial securities regulators, issued guidance in February to regulated crypto exchanges demanding that any stablecoin they list meet certain standards around custodial arrangements, reserve management and audits. The decision to regulate the exchange rather than the issuers, which sets up a kind of backdoor self-regulatory organization, still leaves some questions around the applicability of securities laws. But Alex McDougall, Toronto-based CEO of QCAD-issuer Stablecorp, says the rule-setting was mostly constructive, calling it “a collaborative process, not a witch hunt.”Finally, in New York – note: not Washington, New York – payments giant PayPal harnessed the trust charter that its partner Paxos has held from the New York Department of Financial Services since 2015 to launch what Paxos calls the first regulated stablecoin in the U.S. U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) eviscerated PayPal for launching its coin before her colleagues in the House and Senate have had time to deliberate over a federal law. Her harsh words provoked comparisons to the backlash she and others spearheaded against Facebook’s failed stablecoin, Libra, four years ago.Some are arguing that PayPal’s move, in angering Democrats like Waters, makes it even more likely that the House stablecoin bill, which FInancial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) successfully got through committee last month, dies in the Democrat-controlled Senate. Already, McHenry’s bill has faced opposition from the White House. But as I argued last week, PayPal is pretty safe – there’s just too much pressure now on the federal government to support such projects. Other countries making progress on regulation adds to that pressure.Even so, the fact that so many other places are acting constructively on this issue should be cause for concern for any policymaker charged with furthering U.S. interests globally. Even though dollar stablecoins issued in the U.S. and elsewhere are by far the most sought after in the world — mostly seen in crypto users’ demand for Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT – the “American opportunity” that Castle Ventures Partner Nic Carter and others see in a global “crypto dollar surge'' won't arise until USD stablecoins are given Washington’s imprimatur.In the meantime, other countries will use their head start in regulating this rapidly evolving technology to grab a share of this new field in ways that could undermine U.S. financial leadership. Would it matter if a Swiss-issued, euro-backed stablecoin took market share away from dollars? Maybe not so much. But what if China, which is already working with Russia and other allies on crypto solutions that bypass the dollar in foreign trade, fills the vacuum?I suppose I shouldn’t complain too much. The world might be a much better place if the U.S. squanders this opportunity to turn open-access protocols and the natural demand for dollars into a new form of domination.But the flip side is that if, as expected, the legislative process in the U.S. drags on for a lot longer, it will perpetuate the existing system of Washington-regulated, Wall Street-managed surveillance. That’s a system that puts bank compliance officers and many other types of middlemen into subtle but powerful rent-seeking positions within the global financial system, imposing trillions of dollars in unnecessary costs and often insurmountable barriers to financial access on every person on earth.It’s time to act.]"

At present, the Fed fund rate is in the range of 5.25-5.5%, marking the highest level in more than 22 years. Per the minutes, “In discussing the policy outlook, participants continued to judge that it was critical that the stance of monetary policy be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to the Committee’s 2% objective over time.”On Aug 17, the yield on the short-term 2-Year U.S. Treasury Note rose to 4.928%. This yield is closely linked to the movement of the Fed fund rate. The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note touched 4.255%, its highest since October 2022. This link is closely associated with the mortgage rate. The yield on the long-term 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note closed at 4.367%.Prices of cryptocurrencies are inversely related to the market interest rate. Following the above-mentioned developments, prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC) plummeted 7.3%, 5.8%, 4.4%, 8.45 and 13.4%, respectively.Other ConcernsThe Wall Street Journal reported that Elan Mush promoted space travel company SpaceX wrote down the value of its bitcoin holdings by a total of $373 million in 2022 and 2021, and had sold the crypto currency.U.S. banks are currently under rating watch. On Aug 15, Fitch Ratings warned that it may downgrade ratings of more than a dozen U.S. heavyweight banks in the near future. The rating agency already cut its assessment of the U.S. banking sector in June.Fitch said that another one-notch downgrade of the banking sector’s rating from AA- to A+ will compel the rating agency to reevaluate the ratings of all 70 U.S, banks that it covers for possible downgrade.Story continuesOn Aug 8, Moody’s Investors Service cut the rating of 10 small and mid-sized U.S. banks by a single notch. Moreover, the rating agency put six big banks under review for a potential downgrade. Moody’s also changed its rating outlook to negative for 11 banks.Stocks in FocusRobinhood Markets Inc.

Shares have added about 1.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is IBM due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.IBM Q2 Earnings Beat, Revenues Miss Despite Cloud DemandIBM reported mixed second-quarter 2023 results, wherein the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same. However, the company witnessed healthy demand for hybrid cloud and AI solutions with a client-focused portfolio and broad-based growth.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations was $1,581 million or $1.72 per share compared with $1,465 million or $1.61 per share in the year-ago quarter. The improvement in GAAP earnings was primarily attributable to top-line growth and lower operating expenses.Excluding non-recurring items, non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was $2.18 per share compared with $2.31 in the prior-year quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18 cents.Quarter DetailsQuarterly total revenues decreased to $15,475 million from $15,535 million despite strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, driving growth in the Software and Consulting segments. On a constant currency basis, revenues were up 0.4% year over year. The top line missed the consensus estimate of $15,541 million.Gross profit was $8,501 million compared with $8,290 million in the prior-year quarter, resulting in respective gross margins of 54.9% and 53.4% owing to a strong portfolio mix. Total expenses decreased to $6,501 million from $6,568 million, driven by improvement in the business mix and ongoing productivity initiatives.Segmental PerformanceSoftware: Revenues improved to $6,608 million from $6,166 million, driven by growth in Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions, Red Hat, Data &amp; AI and Transaction Processing. The reported segment revenues exceeded the consensus estimate of $6,352 million owing to solid hybrid cloud traction. Segment pre-tax income from continuing operations was $1,504 million compared with $1,375 million in the year-ago quarter for respective margins of 22.8% and 22.3%. The company is witnessing healthy hybrid cloud adoption by clients and solid demand trends across RedHat, automation and Data &amp; AI.Consulting: Revenues were $5,013 million, up from $4,809 million, led by pervasive growth driven by demand for digital transformation, increasing revenues across all business lines and regions. The reported segment revenues exceeded the consensus estimate of $4,903 million. Segment pre-tax income was $446 million compared with $343 million in the year-ago quarter, driven by productivity enhancement initiatives for respective margins of 8.9% and 7.1%.Infrastructure: Revenues were $3,618 million, down from $4,235 million, owing to lower demand for zSystems and Distributed Infrastructure and support services. Segment pre-tax income was $633 million compared with $757 million in the year-ago quarter for respective margins of 17.5% and 17.9%.Financing: Revenues improved to $185 million from $146 million. Segment pre-tax income was $64 million compared with $102 million in the year-ago quarter for respective margins of 34.9% and 69.7%.Story continuesCash Flow &amp; LiquidityDuring the second quarter, IBM generated $2,638 million in cash from operations compared with $1,321 million in the year-ago quarter, bringing the respective tallies for the first six months of 2023 and 2022 to $6,412 million and $4,569 million. Free cash flow was $2,101 million in the quarter, up from $2,091 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher profit and working capital efficiencies. As of Jun 30, 2023, the company had $9,394 million in cash and cash equivalents with $50,691 million of long-term debt.OutlookFor full-year 2023, the company expects 3-5% revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Free cash flow is estimated to be approximately $10.5 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresAt this time, IBM has a subpar Growth Score of D, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, IBM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of International Business Machines, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for International Business Machines ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About International Business Machines?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.International Business Machines already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see International Business Machines' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in International Business Machines. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.0% by the third-largest shareholder.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of International Business MachinesThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that International Business Machines Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$96m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 42% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand International Business Machines better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for International Business Machines   you should know about.Ultimately the future is most important.

Technological advancements and global market shifts drive the industry's dynamics, often leading to volatile stock movements. For sharp investors, this volatility offers a chance to find hidden gems: stocks that hold underrated value and show promise for significant growth. However, any experienced investor will tell you that to understand a stock's value truly, you need a deep dive into its fundamentals, not just a passing glance at market sentiment.Methodology for Stock SelectionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with F. Click here to check it out. F 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of FTo compile this list, I used the GuruFocus All-In-One Screener. I first screened for car stocks. Then, I examined companies trading at valuations attractive compared to the rest of the industry. Next, I dived deeper into valuation metrics for a comprehensive analysis.Understanding Key Valuation MetricsNow, let's discuss the metrics: P/E ratio, forward P/E ratio, and P/S ratio. These three have consistently showcased their importance in stock valuation. The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, a timeless metric, relates a stock's current market price to its earnings per share, giving an insight into the valuation of each dollar of a company's current earnings. A lower P/E could suggest an undervalued stock. Yet, we should remember that transient factors can sometimes affect current earnings.The Forward P/E ratio gives insight into the market's expectations for a company's future earnings. By relating a stock's present market price to its projected earnings per share for the upcoming fiscal year, we often get a more transparent view of its likely value path.On the other hand, the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio, though not as popular as P/E, centers on a company's revenue. A consistent revenue flow can hint at a stable business in industries where earnings can fluctuate.Story continuesUsing these metrics collectively can shed light on the real value opportunities in the auto sector, pinpointing stocks possibly trading beneath their true worth. In the spirit of GuruFocus, join me as we meticulously research two undervalued auto stocks, viewing them through these crucial valuation metrics.General Motors Co (NYSE:GM): An OverviewFor investors keen on dissecting the Vehicles &amp; Parts sector, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) presents an intriguing case. A glance at its Price-to-Sales (PS) ratio reveals a meager 0.27. In perspective, when stacked against a pool of 1,241 industry counterparts, GM drives ahead of 77.36% of them in valuation terms. Simply put, the market currently values every dollar of GM's sales cheaper than nearly four out of five competitors. While some might argue that a low PS ratio reflects potential business challenges, others could contend it's a flashing ""Buy"" sign for value-oriented investors.GM's Recent Performance and Future ProspectsAlthough its stock slid by roughly 20% in the last six months, the company's recent first-quarter results for 2023 present a glimmering hope for investors seeking undervalued stocks with future growth potential. Revenue surged to an impressive $44.75 billion, marking a 25% year-on-year growth, while the net income leaped by 52% to touch $2.57 billion. In tandem with the company's raised full-year guidance, such promising figures highlight GM's operational efficiency and capacity to meet global automotive demand, even amidst economic downturns.GM's Strategic Moves in EV and Self-Driving TechnologyDiving into the automotive trends, GM is not merely resting on its laurels. They're making discernible strides in electric vehicles (EVs) and self-driving technology, areas primed to redefine the future of mobility. The brand's commitment to hybrid technology and electric mobility is evident in its ambitious aim to churn out one million EV units annually by 2025. Furthermore, their significant stake in Cruise, an autonomous vehicle venture, sets them on a path to potentially rake in $50 billion in revenue by 2030. This aspiration, backed by the company's consistent R&amp;D in automotive innovations and sustainability initiatives, underlines GM's adaptability to emerging markets and dedication to maintaining a competitive edge.GM's Position in the Broader Automotive IndustryHowever, it's essential to acknowledge the broader context. The automotive industry, replete with barriers to entry and influenced by trade tariffs and regulations, requires brands to evolve continuously. GM, amidst this landscape, is focused on enhancing its brand loyalty and expanding its market share. Given their resilience, agility, and the undeniable weight their brand holds in the automotive sector, one could argue that the road ahead seems promising for General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F): An OverviewFord Motor Co (NYSE:F), an American auto behemoth, has showcased impressive numbers that underscore its inherent value. With a trailing twelve months (TTM) price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 11.6, Ford stands ahead of 65.07% of the 896 companies in its sector. This highlights a modestly priced earnings profile relative to many of its competitors. However, the forward PE ratio pegged at 6.34, is where Ford truly shines. This figure is more attractive than a whopping 85.80% of the 169 entities in its industry, hinting at a brighter earnings outlook for the company.Ford's Valuation and Market PositionMoving over to the price-to-sales (PS) ratio, Ford's 0.28 metric suggests a lean valuation in terms of its sales, bettering 77.03% of 1241 industry participants. In an industry driven by innovation and the constant push for sustainability, these valuation indicators suggest that Ford might be an overlooked gem in the expansive Vehicles &amp; Parts marketplace.Ford's Recent Performance and Earnings OutlookOver the past six months, Ford Motor Co's stock performance has experienced a dip of 8%, a metric that might deter the casual investor. Yet, a deeper dive into their recent earnings showcases an intriguing narrative. In the second quarter of 2023, Ford posted revenue of $44.95 billion, marking an impressive surge of 12% year-on-year. Even more striking is its net income of $1.92 billion, a monumental 187% jump compared to the previous year. The company significantly outperformed expectations, beating its June 2023 EPS forecast by 34%.Ford's Strategic Initiatives in EV and Digital TechnologyDelving into the broader automotive industry landscape, there's a palpable shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid technology. Ford, recognizing the future growth potential of this segment, is investing heavily in EV infrastructure. Its recent collaboration with South Korean firms to establish a $886 million EV battery materials plant in Quebec is a testament to this commitment. On the technological forefront, Ford's recruitment of a former Apple executive to oversee its software subscription business signals its ambition to marry automotive innovation with digital prowess. Further, its burgeoning alliance with Chongqing Changan Automobile in the realm of new-energy vehicles highlights Ford's strategic maneuvers to solidify its footprint in emerging markets, especially amidst the constantly evolving automotive trends.Ford's Operational Efficiency and Future ProspectsFactor in Ford's operational efficiency evident from its recent restart of the F-150 Lightning production in response to rising demand and it becomes evident that the company is well-poised to capitalize on global automotive demand. With a robust R&amp;D division, an unwavering commitment to sustainability, and renowned brand loyalty among consumers, Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) might be one of the undervalued stocks to watch in the coming months.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Shares have lost about 12.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is United due for a breakout?

UAL’s revenues increased 17.1% year over year due to upbeat air-travel demand. The year-over-year increase in the top line was driven by a 20.1% rise in passenger revenues (accounting for 91.7% of the top line) to $13,002 million. Nearly 42 million passengers traveled on UAL flights in the second quarter.Cargo revenues fell 36.9% year over year to $362 million. Revenues from other sources increased 14.8% from the second quarter of 2022 to $814 million.Other Details of Q2Below, we present all comparisons (in % terms) with the second quarter of 2022 figures unless otherwise stated.Consolidated passenger revenue per available seat mile (a key measure of unit revenues) increased 2.2%. Total revenue per available seat mile fell 0.4% to 19.28 cents. The average yield per revenue passenger mile increased 2.6% to 20.46 cents.Consolidated airline traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles, grew 17%, while capacity, measured in available seat miles, grew 17.5%. Consolidated load factor (percentage of seat occupancy) inched down 0.3 percentage points to 86.4%, higher than our estimate of 81.4%.The average aircraft fuel price per gallon fell 36.4% to $2.66, lower than our expectation of $2.83. Fuel gallons consumed were up 16.4% from the second quarter of 2022 actuals.Story continuesOperating expenses (on a reported basis) increased 12.7% to $12,661 million. Consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile (CASM), excluding fuel, third-party business expenses, profit-sharing and special charges, grew 2% to 11.85 cents.UAL exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $9,605 million compared with $7,634 million at the end of the prior quarter.

However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

The third-quarter 2023 dividend will be paid out on Nov 15 to shareholders of record as of Oct 31, 2023.Based on the Aug 17 closing price of $200.61, Virtus Investment's annual dividend yield post the dividend hike will stand at 3.79%.Prior to the recent hike, the company had increased its dividend by 10% in August 2022. VRTS raised its quarterly dividend six times in the last five years. Also, it has a five-year annualized dividend growth of 34.5%. Currently, the company's payout ratio is 32% of earnings.George R. Aylward, president and CEO of VRTS, commented, ""We are pleased to raise our dividend for the sixth consecutive year, reflecting the strong free cash flow generated by the business and the flexibility of our balance sheet to support our capital priorities. Returning capital to shareholders is an important element of our capital management strategy, alongside investing in the growth of the business and maintaining appropriate levels of leverage.""Apart from the regular dividend payments, VRTS has a share repurchase program in place. In 2010, the company announced a new repurchase program, under which, it authorized to repurchase 5,680,045 shares. In second-quarter 2023, Virtus Investment repurchased 51,840 shares. As of Jun 30, 2023, the plan had nearly 776,512 shares remaining under the repurchase authorization.Supported by its solid assets under management balance as of Jun 30, 2023, and decent capital position, the company is expected to continue with efficient capital deployment activities.

How hard are rising costs of living hitting Americans and are adjustments keeping up? Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith, Dani Romero, Diane King Hall, and Julie Hyman explore how various factors, from student loan payments and child care costs to inflation, may be pricing consumers out from various living essentials.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Welcome back, everyone. You're watching ""Yahoo Finance Live"". And for this special Friday conversation bringing your way focus on cost of living right now and particularly here as we've continued to see a lot of retail data come out over the course of this week.Some of the focus needs to still be on areas where inflation is remaining increasingly sticky. Housing is one of those. But also if you look at the main areas that consumers are going to be concerned about it is what they're paying just for their cost of living and housing and shelter but also energy where that factors into what they're purchasing here.And we've got, of course, our panel that has brought together some great statistics. And we've got Dani Romero, of course, Diane King Hall, and Julie Hyman, yours truly Brad Smith here, and as we think about where the cost of living is. There's so much geographical focus, but perhaps we start with where homes particularly have continued and the prices there for shelter costs have continued to remain elevated. This is something you track on a day in, day out basis standing.DANI ROMERO: And housing has two categories. We have houses like homes, and we also have rents. So they're a little bit separate. But let's go to the housing front specifically. Consumers are still very sensitive to rates. And now that mortgage rates hovered way north of that 7%, you're really seeing that pull back in demand.Story continuesBut another perspective is that today's rates are actually at a normalized level if you compare it to prior to 2008. So that's to give you some perspective. Wow, to us, it might be a little bit of a shocker. But if we compare it to historical levels, it is about normal range, the 7%. But we're also seeing that the Fed's efforts to crush inflation is really happening in that housing market. Demand is slowing down. The applications to purchase a home hit the lowest level.JULIE HYMAN: But are prices coming down?DANI ROMERO: That's the issue. And it goes back to that inventory issue, the supply and demand side of things. And inventory is still a big issue. But I think on the housing front specifically, it's the affordable inventory.DIANE KING HALL: And it's not enough. With rates continuing to rise, like that 7% level, should it get to 8%, that's not going to get any buyers in the market. I mean, people are sitting on levels. Like if they got in a home at 3%, 3.25%, they're not going to sell their home now because they can't get something new for better. So they're going to stay in that starter home for longer.It's going to become more than a starter home. They may raise their kids through college there because of where rates are now. And the indications when we think about where the Fed could potentially go and especially what we heard this week in terms of the minutes, it could go higher. And that just continues to hurt demand within the housing market.DANI ROMERO: One way that an economist had explained to me is that if mortgage rates go up, there's actually more inventory that gets onto the market because the cost of households goes up. And so that squeezes the person.And so if rates are lower, if mortgage rates go down, that means there's lower inventory because people-- that spurs up the whole [? horroring. ?] I'm going to stay in my home. But that was a dynamic that an economist brought up of how he's looking at the market right now. So that's kind of an interesting perspective to look at too.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah, it's hard to see it that way. And I mean, we talked to economists after economist about if it's a buyer's market, is it a seller's market. And the point that many of them come back to is, it's neither, you know? You can't go anywhere really.I was shocked when I saw that number. I know from a historical perspective, it's certainly not the highest we've ever seen if we go back to the '80s. I don't know if all of us were around in the '80s. I know at least three of us were.DANI ROMERO: Don't age yourself. Don't age yourself.DIANE KING HALL: It's fine. I mean--JULIE HYMAN: Two of us.DIANE KING HALL: Two of us. Oh, OK. Right.BRAD SMITH: I was here.JULIE HYMAN: You were here in the '80s?BRAD SMITH: Yeah, first image of it.JULIE HYMAN: Yes, first image.DIANE KING HALL: Happy birthday shout out on air. We have to do it. It's only apropos.BRAD SMITH: But the cost of living has certainly risen a lot since then. And when we think about so many of the different factors that consumers right now are faced with, there's housing, there's your energy costs. And energy costs have receded from some of the highs that we had seen even a year ago.And you think back to even the retail sales data that we've seen. And that gives us a sense of how consumers are spending, and where they're looking at price. And for the retail companies that have reported earnings this week, while volumes might be receding a little bit, that price that they're having to pass on, that continuing to remain elevated as well.JULIE HYMAN: I keep thinking too about there's the cost of living and there's the perception of cost of living. And while we tend to talk to a lot of economists who talk about disinflation, the rate of inflation--DIANE KING HALL: SlowingJULIE HYMAN: --is decreasing, I don't think that's how consumers look at the issue.DIANE KING HALL: No.JULIE HYMAN: If you go to the grocery store, you're not saying, oh, well, I'm only paying 2/10 of a percent more this month than I was paying last month. You're thinking year over year. You're thinking over time, and you're thinking more of a vibe, more of a feeling.I mean, if you look at the food at home prices in July on an unseasonably adjusted basis, they rose 3.6% year-over-year. So away food in restaurants rose about 7% year-over-year. So even if you don't know exactly what those figures are and even if it isn't going up at the same rate month-over-month, you still feel like you're spending more. And that is also going to inform your spending decisions in a number of different areas.DIANE KING HALL: That's right. And we saw that play out in the numbers at Target versus Walmart. I mean, Walmart was the winner there in terms of the grocery spend. Walmart gets-- I mean, we don't know what it is for the quarter but annually, they get about half of their revenue from grocery. So they're winning there because to your point, consumers are spending on needs. They have to buy food. Even if inflation is still sticky when it comes to food, you have to. You can't not eat, right? Excuse the double negative.But Target they only get what? About a fifth of their sales from grocery. I mean, look at their grocery section. It's much smaller. We had a conversation about that early in the week. And you're not-- generally when you're going to Target, that's not necessarily what you're going for. And if you're making cuts to your budget and what you're spending on, you're going to cut out those non-essentials.So Target did a little bit better in beauty, but it wasn't enough to account for that slowdown and what they're seeing in other areas. Nobody needs to replace their throw pillows every quarter or whatever. You're not replacing all your accessories. So Target needs to do something different.And we saw also the difference between Target and Walmart when it comes to e-commerce. So Walmart did better on e-commerce as well, and that was a surprise. They did 24% better whereas Target saw a slowdown. Target's talking on their earnings call about making some changes to mobile, et cetera.But again Target also appeals to that more higher end shopper. And another kind of thing that we're waiting for and what this may do to quote unquote, ""higher end shopper"" is the student loan payments coming back, what that's going to do to people's budgets, right?BRAD SMITH: Right and so--DANI ROMERO: But will it though? Because a lot of the student loans have-- I was reading your ""Morning Brief"", Julie, and you really hammered that point home that, is it really going to impact those budgets? I mean, I already got my student loan payment requirement, what I'm supposed to do. So, I mean, yeah, you look at it and you're like, OK, I see it. This is-- I mean, it's lower for me than what I was paying before, but that's because I've been chucking away at it.JULIE HYMAN: And that was the argument that I cited in that ""Morning Brief"". It was from some Bank of America research that essentially said, the people who suspended their student loan payments when they were given the opportunity to do so are people whose household balance sheets were not in great shape to begin with.So in other words, when they have to repay the marginal spend that's going to go away is smaller than it would be for someone who's in better financial shape anyway. So in other words, it's going to be just a smaller hit. Yes, for that individual, it's going to make a difference. But if you look at the wholesale effect on consumer spending, it might not be that huge. Now take it in concert with the work down in excess savings and some of the other effects--DIANE KING HALL: Exactly.JULIE HYMAN: --maybe you'll have a difference. But I also go back to the idea of consumers being more choosy. When Walmart talks about high net-worth consumers spending at Walmart, trading down to Walmart, it's not necessarily because those folks cannot afford to shop at Whole Foods or a Target or wherever else. Maybe it's because they took that family vacation to Europe.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: And so they're reallocating--DIANE KING HALL: Their spendingJULIE HYMAN: --their money. So, yes, the cost of living for everyone has gone higher, but spending hasn't necessarily on a real level, real spending if you account for changes in inflation, that picture is not as clear.BRAD SMITH: So just to bring this all together here because there's a few topics that we've talked about; we've talked about the cost of shelter; we've talked about the cost of just transportation, kind of getting around and gas, but also the necessity and food as well. But what does this all come back to in your cost of living? It's how much you're making, which you were starting to get into a moment ago.And if we're looking at where that marries up to the data that we've already seen, the August 4th reading even in the survey of consumers as they had noted there, the environment, the economic environment, consumers are perceiving little difference from last month substantial improvements relative to three months ago here. And what does this come back to? It comes back to how much they're making and where the job opportunities to continue to come forward.And so even within that, we've been continuing to have the conversation about where there's been so much investment in the US, whether that is making sure that there are more chip factories that are getting brought online. We just had a conversation this morning about industrials and where they need to back though for some of those jobs too.And so then you see this circular motion of, well, if the wages need to still continue to go higher in those categories that are still hiring heavily, how does that still continue to add to the broader inflationary picture where companies are saying, all right, well, if the employment environment is strong, then people are still going to be willing to pay up just a little bit more.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah. And I mean, that is a good point, especially when you think about how robust the job market has been. We've continued to see it hold up in the front of expectations for it to weaken and it hasn't. And that begs the question about what direction are we going in terms of also this fight against inflation. Are we going to continue to go higher? Is it again also that theme that we've heard higher for longer, and then what that does in general to the economy?JULIE HYMAN: I mean, at this point you have a lot of economists saying that the Fed is going to cut rates next year just to bring rates more down to a normal level. If indeed though you see the same trajectory we've been seeing where wages remain relatively elevated because most of the folks we're talking to are still seeing it might not be as hard to find workers, but it's still not easy for them necessarily to find workers, particularly in the services industry. And then you can add on the new chip factories and all of that onto that.So if you're going to see that persistence, are you going to have the Fed with the ability to cut rates? It's far from a certain outcome.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah, and definitely not right now.DANI ROMERO: I wanted to say one thing that we haven't discussed is the population. I mean, we've been growing. I mean, the pandemic babies, that's also another factor that I think we weren't seeing before and now we're seeing it. Right now we have a newborn. People I know, my friends have newborns. And so that's something to consider in your budget too.I mean, if before you were doing OK, now you have a newborn or two newborns, childcare costs is really-- household formation is happening. We're seeing that more so now than obviously during the pandemic. And also immigration is part of this too. So I think those are all other factors to factor into this living cost equation.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And child care costs, by the way, are not slowing down.DIANE KING HALL: Yes--BRAD SMITH: No.DIANE KING HALL: --they're not.JULIE HYMAN: They're not So that's something--DIANE KING HALL: We've had that con-- yeah, like just the conversation about that and what people are choosing to do when they figure out how they're going to manage their budget around that. It is expensive. Childcare is expensive. So we had this conversation about some people doing things like taking their kid with them to a bar which--JULIE HYMAN: There's an article about that that wasn't there.DIANE KING HALL: Yes, some bars are family friendly.DANI ROMERO: Here in New York I feel likeBRAD SMITH: I know my buddy took his child.JULIE HYMAN: I mean, stick a baby in a carriage you can take them anywhere, trust me.DIANE KING HALL: Yes.JULIE HYMAN: When they're small enough--DIANE KING HALL: Yes, take them with you.JULIE HYMAN: They're portable.DIANE KING HALL: Exactly. They are portable.BRAD SMITH: You just got to be able to check that sippy cup and a good amount of time.JULIE HYMAN: That's right.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah.BRAD SMITH: Absolutely. I believe we've got to leave things there on the day before things get a little too saucy out here.JULIE HYMAN: But wait, we got one more thing to say.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, what's that?JULIE HYMAN: Happy birthday, Brad.

167,77fa34ec-eb7d-3871-952f-8efe780434b3,TGT,2023-08-19,What we learned about the consumer this week,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/learned-consumer-week-160554700.html,1692374754,VIDEO,"['WMT', 'HD', 'TGT', 'TJX']","[There was a lot of retail data out this week, with July retail sales coming in better than economists were expecting. Meanwhile earnings from Walmart (WMT) and TJX (TJX) were strong, whereas Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) sales took a hit. New York Times Retail Reporter Jordyn Holman joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what these recent earnings results are showing about the state of the consumer.Holman explains how consumers are being discerning at this time, which is something Walmart CEO Doug McMillon noted on the company’s earnings call. “People are buying groceries, they’re trading down,” which is “part of this longer trend that we’ve been seeing over the past year,” Holman says. Walmart has “a bigger leg up” than Target, Holman says because it sells more groceries and has lower price points. Target also experienced boycotts in June over pride-themed displays at stores, which impacted the company’s sales.As this summer saw consumers spending on goods for experiences such as Barbie and tours from superstars Taylor Swift and Beyoncé, Holman notes that although “people have been spending a lot on those experiences as expected...they’re still leaving space in their budget to buy the groceries or buy some of the bigger items that we weren’t expecting.” “It still remains to be seen how long that can last,” as people have a “finite amount of money,” but that’s “one of these really interesting dynamics that’s happened this summer,” Holman says.Video Transcript- It has been a huge week for retail, starting with retail sales for July blowing past estimates to rise 0.7% on a monthly basis, showing that the consumer is still strong. Then we had earnings galore. Home Depot, Target continuing to struggle in sales growth as consumers traded down. Meanwhile, Walmart and TJX excelled as they captured those cautious shoppers. Apparently, that's hard to say, cautious shoppers looking for deals.Joining us now with more on this week in retail is Jordyn Holman, New York Times retail reporter. And you wrote about Target among other things this week and how they were not necessarily participating here, Jordyn. One of the things we've been talking about this morning is sort of the selectiveness, the discretion that shoppers are exercising right now. Because it's not that they're not spending, it's just they're only buying certain stuff. So how are you sort of thinking about the bigger themes here?Story continuesJORDYN HOLMAN: Yes. I think it's part of this longer trend that we've been seeing over the past year, I would say, about people are buying groceries. They're trading down. Meaning, they're buying private label if they're buying groceries or apparel. And when you look at a store like Target and you compare it with Walmart, Walmart just has a bigger leg up because they sell more groceries than a Target does. And then they do have lower price points relative to a Target.And so that's kind of that discerning nature. And even Walmart's CEO yesterday, on a call with investors, used that word. Customers are being discerning. And that's why Walmart is winning right now this environment.- I mean, we're looking at some of these shoppers with a household income of about $100,000 really honing in on Walmart here, especially when it comes to groceries. What's Walmart going to do to have to hang on to some of these shoppers? And how key are they to the bottom line?JORDYN HOLMAN: I thought that was actually a really interesting point that Doug McMillon, Walmart CEO, made yesterday on the call. He said these higher income shoppers are coming into Walmart because they also are trying to save money where they can, and that is through grocery. But once they have them in the store, that opens up an opportunity to maybe sell them more discretionary items. Maybe you're selling them the clothes or an interesting-- like cooking supplies or whatnot.And so that's one strategy that they're using to bring them in. And then also, given that this is a back-to-school season, that's a crucial selling holiday that sets them up for Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas to keep them coming back for that even more crucial selling season.- Jordyn, we continue to talk about, and hear from actually, many of the executives who are trying to lean into cultural relevance in order to grow out the client base, the customer base, that they're able to welcome into their stores and able to perhaps create a deeper relationship with. But then issues on the other side when they waver on their stances. And that was the issue for Target. How much did they shoot themselves in the foot this quarter?JORDYN HOLMAN: Yes. As I'm sure we all remember back during Pride Month or actually just a few days before June, Target was at the center of an anti-LGBTQ boycott given their pride merchandise, where Target moved a lot of the merchandise to the back of the store. And that issue came up again in their earnings, noting that in June, they did take a sales hit because-- I mean, in addition to the consumer pullback, there is obviously consumers who said, I'm not shopping with Target.The CEO got a lot of questions on the call about that. Where does Target stand when they want to support a specific community? And Target said, hey, we want to be welcoming to all people. We learn from that. And we don't quite know what that will mean-- of how that shows up at Target. But I think what was clear is that cultural issue came up in a financial call. So it's all intertwined and it's just putting a fine point on the idea that culture and sales and retail are all connected.- And Jordyn, I want to talk about some of the discernment that we've seen on good spending. Meanwhile, people were willing to risk it all together-- outfits together for Beyonce, for Taylor Swift, for Barbie as well. How much of this is going to be a blip? Being that you have these huge tours that people are spending on and really getting dressed up and spending on goods, how much of an anomaly is this though?JORDYN HOLMAN: Yeah, I was talking to our analysts about this yesterday. There was this idea going into the year that people would just pull back on spending a lot on goods, and that it would just be a summer and a year of experiences and the concerts and the movies. But there's a lot more dynamics at play. Yes, people have been spending a lot on those experiences as expected. But they're still leaving space in their budget to buy the groceries or buy some of the bigger items that we weren't expecting.And I think it still remains to be seen how long that can last because we all do have a finite amount of money. But that is definitely one of these really interesting dynamics that's happened this summer.- What's the setup for the holiday season? Now coming off of what we've kind of started to get some insight into the back-to-school season, and then even further as we perhaps all get ready to dress like Barbie and Ken all over again once we hit Halloween.JORDYN HOLMAN: Yes. So retailers are planning conservatively still for the back half of this year because student loan repayments have to start again. Interest rates are still high. Inflation is still stubborn. So we're not out of the clear yet. But when going back to Walmart, for them, they're like, well that's actually-- we play well in that.People are already looking to save money. They'll come to us for all of those things. But a company like Home Depot, Walgreens, Target, they all said that they're playing more conservatively for the holiday season. And it will be a nice surprise if that is a strong one.- Certainly, that consumer hanging in there, at least for now. A big thank you to Jordyn Holman, New York Times retail reporter. Thank you for joining us today.]"

On the one hand, historically high inflation is causing consumers to spend more, resulting in excess savings in the U.S. dropping more than 75% since August 2021, according to the San Francisco Federal Reserve. On the other hand, retail sales in the U.S. grew 0.7% in July, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, which continues a streak of better-than-expected sales numbers.Continue reading]"

The interest rate debate as bond yields surge following the Fed's July FOMC meeting minutes. China undergoes a harsh economic slowdown with the nation's central bank cutting its interest rates.Yahoo Finance Live's Brad Smith and Julie Hyman debrief on this week's top developments and how these earnings and economic narratives are presenting new pressures for consumers and investors alike.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Did we learn this week? For shoppers who have been more cautious focused on trading down and buying lower priced items, Walmart won big. While the more discretionary leaning Target saw sales slump.BRAD SMITH: Second. The rates debate is, yeah, alive and well. The 10-year Treasury yield saw its highest close since 2008 after Wednesday's Fed minutes suggested officials are still focused on containing inflation.JULIE HYMAN: And finally, economic woes abound in China. The world's second largest economy is still struggling to recover post-pandemic. China's central bank cutting key interest rates on disappointing economic data. And new fears of a looming property crisis there from mega developers, Country Garden and, I guess, the ghost of Evergrande, you could say, after it filed for chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the US. That is not helping matters either.So a pretty eventful week for Summer August week. But I think whether you look at any of these three factors, they're not just a one-week story, whether you're talking about the consumer, whether you're talking about inflation, the Fed, and the trajectory for bond yields, or whether you're talking about China, these themes are going to be lasting.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. Three types of woes in different area codes here, as we think about specifically the consumer, though. And what we were hearing from some of the larger retailers over the course of this week, many of them trying to glean as best as they could into the back-to-school shopping season and see what that sets up in terms of a demand profile for consumers and the propensity to spend going into the holiday season.Story continuesAnd that really gets us to the crux of some of the forecasts that we heard. And Target really jumped out. And even though you did see some interesting stock price movement in reaction to the earnings, where they did lower that guidance, I think, critically here, Walmart may have saved some of that tenure at least.And it really is about where the consumer is going to be spending, where they're looking for discounts. We spoke with Tanger Outlets CEO, as well. And he laid out a picture saying, consumers are clearly looking for sales and discounts right now. So it's a matter of which brands are being able to not just manage inventory the best in this retail environment, but also make sure that the pricing strategy is such that consumers will continue to feel comfortable spending their dollars, those discretionary dollars where they had shown some weakness coming into this year, especially in that apparel and footwear category too.JULIE HYMAN: I keep coming back to the comment that Simeon Siegel of BMO made to us, where he talked about that because of normalization in inventory right now, and more of a normalization of the environment, it's going to be more about management execution on the part of retailers.So that begs the question of, is Target a macro issue of people really looking to save money? Or is it a Target issue? And I don't think we have the answer to that question yet. But we do have a few other clues.Firstly, we did have Walmart saying that there is a little bit of purchasing of big ticket items coming back in a little bit, even though Home Depot said the opposite. We got retail sales this week as well. And those numbers were quite strong, particularly even online, yes, but even for things like apparel.So how is that going to play out beyond a Target, which has seen in the past strength in its apparel business? How is that going to play out for the specialty retailers when we start to hear from the Gaps of the world now? Gap has its own issues. But how is that going to start to play out when we hear from more of those companies?So there's all of these hints and still questions about it's not that people are pulling back on their spending-- I think the retail sales number made that clear-- it's still that they are spending on certain things. Are they spending more on travel, and, therefore, will only buy clothes on sale, for example?So I think we're still getting a bigger picture for all of this.BRAD SMITH: Or only buy t-shirts that say I love New York on them. Who knows. But for the Fed and how they weigh all of this data, it's been amazing to see even in the minutes and how they were discussing the state of the consumer coming into their last meeting, and what that sets up for September and November.And a lot of the signs pointing towards a potential November hike. And even if we do have a muted decision in September here, the way that the Fed has been talking about this, as shown through their meeting minutes over the course of this week, that certainly had some price action in the bond market and the yields, particularly, saying that consumer price inflation as measured by the 12-month percent change in the price index for PCE remained elevated in May.Available information suggested that inflation declined, but remained elevated in June. And so since then, we've also had July's reading. And now, we're thinking about where the Fed will continue to need to dampen down on-- of course, that's chart right there, that larger trend, the inflation rate, and their target.Remember, folks, 2% is what they're going to be looking for here. And so will the Fed be comfortable with us remaining around this 3% ballpark, at least, for the time being, while they wait to see if their policy that is enacted has fully been digested. And at what point will they believe it's fully digested?JULIE HYMAN: One thing that maybe we'll get it a little bit closer to being digested, we saw an increase in mortgage rates, in 30-year mortgage rates this week. And so that's something that eventually, we could see weigh on consumer spending, especially we got a little bit of a warning, perhaps, from Canada in the form of Doug McMillon, the CEO of Walmart, making commentary about Canadian customers being a little more cautious.Apparently, the mortgage market there is more short-term mortgages than it is here in the US. And so then they are starting to feel the pinch of higher rates a little more. That's moving its way through the system a little more quickly than it is here. I thought that was a really interesting comment.BRAD SMITH: To that, I say, hey, all right.]"

These latest reports continue the trend that Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) and Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) portrayed earlier which is that high-end and premium ‘wants’ retailers are on the losing side of this macroeconomic chapter, while necessities and off-price retailers are on the winning one, with customers still being willing to splurge and find bargainsf for discounted premium goods.Ross Stores jumped nearly 5% a day upon its report. Like TJX who reported steady sales of its discount apparel and accessories and a stronger than expected demand for home decor goods, the discount retailer topped both sales and earnings estimates for its second quarter.  Net sales grew 7.7% to $4.93 billion, topping the expected $4.75 billion with earnings per share amounting to $1.32, surpassing Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $1.16. While Ross Stores previously expected its 2023 same-store sales be stay relatively flat, it now expects them to expand between 2% and 3%. The off-price retailer also lifted its annual profit per share guidance from the previous range of $4.77 to $4.99 to a newly projected range of $5.15 to $5.26.As for the e-commerce fashion platform, Farfetch made a big revenue miss as it reported it generated $572 million in the second quarter, which is a far cry from Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $649 million. Its shares tanked 41% in early morning trading upon results as the e-commerce luxury fashion retailer provided a weaker-than-expected full year guidance as well as trimmed its gross merchandise value outlook. With a second quarter report riddled with disappointing figures and debt, Farfetch suffered on the side of losing high-end retailers.Story continuesEstee Lauder, who was once the star of challenging times thanks to “the lipstick index” its chairman coined, didn’t get to be a winner in these post-pandemic recessionary times. As skincare replacing lipsticks when COVID-19 started its relentless march across the globe, now the beauty brand reported declining sales for its fiscal fourth quarter. Still, it succeeded to top fourth quarter earnings and revenue estimates. Adjusted earnings per share of 7 cents surpassed the loss of 4 cents per share that Refinitiv’s survey of analysts expected, while revenue of $3.61 billion topped Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $3.48 billion. For the undergoing first fiscal quarter, Estee Lauder is expecting an EPS loss in the range between 31 and 21 cents per share, while Fact Set’s survey of analysts earnings per share of 98 cents. Its shares tanked 4% as the cosmetics giant lowered its full-year outlook.Consumer Behavior Brought Darkness To High End Retailers And Dawn To Discounted RetailersTJX and Ross Stores inflation-hit customers shopped for its discounted clothing and shoes and looking for bargains on premium apparel brands. Despite tightened household spending, consumers looked for cheaper deals on both essentials and non-essentials. While high-end retailers struggled with bloated inventories, they were ‘rescued’ by discounting retailers who got to offer a wider assortment as a result of offloading their inventories. Therefore, consumers are not willing to give up on splurges despite tightened budgets but are approaching them in a cost-conscious way, leaving high-end retailers in the dark while boosting revenue of discount retailers such as TJX and Ross Stores.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.Barbara Rentler: Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter 2023 performance followed by our updated outlook for the second-half and fiscal year. Afterwards we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our second quarter results with both sales and earnings well above our expectations. Along with easing inflationary pressures, customers responded well to our improved value offerings throughout our stores. Total sales for the period were $4.9 billion, up from $4.6 billion last year, while comparable store sales rose 5%.Story continuesEarnings per share for the 13-weeks ended July 29, 2023 were $1.32 on net income of $446 million. These results compared to $1.11 per share on net earnings of $385 million in the prior year second quarter. For the first six months, earnings per share were $2.41 on net income of $818 million. These results compared to earnings per share of $2.08 on net earnings of $723 million and first-half of 2022. Sales to 2023 year-to-date period were $9.4 billion with comparable sales up 3% versus a 7% decline in the first-half of last year. Cosmetics and accessories were the strongest merchandise areas during the quarter, while performance across geographic areas was broad based. Similar to Ross, dd’s DISCOUNTS performance also improved due to better merchandised assortments and the aforementioned moderating inflation.At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were down 15% versus last year, while average store inventories were up 4%. Packaway merchandise represented 38% of total inventories versus 41% in the same period of the prior year. Turning to store growth, we opened 18 new Ross and nine dd's DISCOUNT locations in the second quarter. We remain on track to open a total of approximately 100 locations this year, comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plan to close or reclose -- relocate about 10 stores. Now, Adam will provide further details on our second quarter results and additional color on our updated outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2023.Adam Orvos: Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales were, up 5% for the quarter, driven by higher traffic. Second quarter operating margin was flat, compared to last year at 11.3%. Cost of goods sold during the period improved by 185 basis points. Merchandise margin increased 200 basis points, primarily due to lower ocean freight costs. Domestic freight declined 60 basis points, while occupancy and distribution cost improved by 20 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively. Partially offsetting these benefits were buying expenses that delevered by 100 basis points, mainly due to higher incentives. SG&amp;A for the period increased 180 basis points as higher incentive costs and store wages more than offset the leverage from higher sales.Girl shopping, Girl in supermbarket, girl with shopping cartCopyright: nicoletaionescu / 123RF Stock PhotoDuring the second quarter we repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $230 million, we remain on track to buyback a total of $950 million in stock for the year. Now let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2023. As Barbara noted in today’s press release, despite the recent moderation and inflation, our low to moderate income customer continues to face persistently higher costs on necessities. As a result, we believe it is prudent to continue to plan the business cautiously. However, given our improved second quarter performance we are raising our second-half sales and earnings outlook. We are now planning comparable store sales for the third and fourth quarters of 2023 to be up 2% to 3% and 1% to 2% respectively.As noted in our press release, if the second-half performs in line with these updated sales assumptions, earnings per share for the third quarter is projected to be $1.16 to $1.21 versus $1 last year and $1.58 to $1.64 for the fourth quarter, compared to $1.31 in 2022. Based on our first-half results and second-half guidance, earnings per share for fiscal year 2023 are now planned to be in the range of $5.15 to $5.26 versus $4.38 last year. Incorporated in this updated guidance range is an estimated benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.16 from the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. Now let's turn to our guidance assumptions for the third quarter of 2023. Total sales are forecast to increase 4% to6% versus the prior year. We expect to open 51 stores during the quarter, including 43 Ross and eight dd's locations.Operating margin for the third quarter is planned to be in the 10.3% to 10.5% range versus 9.8% in 2022, as the benefit from lower ocean and domestic freight costs more than offsets an increase in other expenses, primarily related to incentive compensation and store wages. Net interest income is estimated to be approximately $34 million versus $2.8 million last year as we continue to benefit from higher interest rates and our cash balance. The tax rate is projected to be about 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $337 million. Now I'll turn the call over to Barbara for closing comments.Barbara Rentler: Thank you, Adam. While we are pleased with our above planned results in the second quarter, the macroeconomic, geopolitical and retail environments remain uncertain. Moving forward we remain keenly focused on delivering the most compelling bargains possible as our customer is more motivated than ever to seek the best branded values as prolonged inflation remains an issue. We will also carefully manage our expenses and inventory to maximize our potential for both sales and earnings growth. Longer term, we believe the rigorous execution of our off-price business models will allow us to consistently deliver solid results. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.See also 25 Biggest Land Owners in the US and Top 20 Most Profitable Airlines in the World.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Domestic freight declined 60 basis points while occupancy and distribution costs improved by 20 and 5 basis points, respectively. Partially offsetting these benefits were buying expenses that delevered by 100 basis points mainly due to higher incentives. SG&amp;A for the period increased 180 basis points as higher incentive costs and store wages more than offset the leverage from higher sales. During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $230 million. We remain on track to buyback a total of $950 million in stock for the year. Now let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2023. As Barbara noted in today's press release, despite the recent moderation in inflation, our low to moderate income customer continues to face persistently higher costs on necessities. As a result, we believe it is prudent to continue to plan the business cautiously. However, given our improved second quarter performance, we are raising our second half sales and earnings outlook. We are now planning comparable store sales for the third and fourth quarters of 2023 to be up 2% to 3% and 1% to 2%, respectively. As noted in our press release, if the second half performs in line with these updated sales assumptions, earnings per share for the third quarter is projected to be $1.16 to $1.21 versus $1 last year, and $1.58 to $1.64 for the fourth quarter compared to $1.31 in 2022.Based on our first half results and second half guidance, earnings per share for fiscal year 2023 are now planned to be in the range of $5.15 to $5.26 versus $4.38 last year. Incorporated in this updated guidance range is an estimated benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.16 from the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. Now let's turn to our guidance assumptions for the third quarter of 2023. Total sales are forecast to increase 4% to 6% versus the prior year. We expect to open 51 stores during the quarter, including 43 Ross and 8 dd's locations. Operating margin for the third quarter is planned to be in the 10.3% to 10.5% range versus 9.8% in 2022 as the benefit from lower ocean and domestic freight costs more than offset an increase in other expenses, primarily related to incentive compensation and store wages. Net interest income is estimated to be approximately $34 million versus $2.8 million last year as we continue to benefit from higher interest rates on our cash balance. The tax rate is projected to be about 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 337 million. Now I will turn the call over to Barbara for closing comments.Barbara RentlerThank you, Adam. While we are pleased with our above-plan results in the second quarter, the macroeconomic, geopolitical and retail environments remain uncertain. Moving forward, we remain keenly focused on delivering the most compelling bargains possible as our customer is more motivated than ever to seek the best branded value as prolonged inflation remains an issue. We will also carefully manage our expenses and inventory to maximize our potential for both sales and earnings growth. Longer term, we believe the rigorous execution of our off-price business model will allow us to consistently deliver solid results. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions)And the first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.Matthew Robert BossGreat. Thanks and congrats on a really nice quarter. So Barbara, could you just elaborate on the improved value offerings that you cited in the release and just proactive assortment changes that you've made in stores that you think are contributing to the improved performance. If any way to speak to trends that you're seeing with traffic versus basket as the second quarter progressed and into August, that would be really helpful.Michael J. HartshornMatthew, let me start on overall trends for the quarter on sequential trends. We wouldn't provide specifics, but I would say comps were relatively strong across the quarter, both on a single year comp basis in a multiyear basis. On the components, as we said in the commentary, traffic was the primary driver of the 5% comp. That was true for both chains. Average basket was flat with an increase -- slight increase in the units per transaction and a lower AUR, which offset the units per transaction.Barbara RentlerAnd then, Matt, in terms of the improved value offerings, as we said before, we are really striving to offer better branded value margins to the customer. I mean, our customer is a low to moderate income customer and the merchants have been out there really chasing the business, buying closeouts really looking for compelling, compelling values in bargains, and that's across all areas in the company. It's not just one particular area. It's everywhere because that's really what the customers are responding to and because the amount of availability of the market, we've been able to do that.Matthew Robert BossGreat. And then just as a follow-up, could you expand on gross margin for the balance of this year, meaning how best to think about the opportunity to recapture markdown headwinds that we saw a year ago as the year progresses within merchandise margin? And then just multiyear, are there any structural impediments to returning to pre-pandemic operating margin levels, which I think were in the mid-13s?Adam M. OrvosYes, I'll take the first piece. Matt, this is Adam. Thanks for the question. Third quarter, from an operating margin standpoint, the components will look similar to second quarter. So ocean freight was a significant tailwind for us will continue in third quarter. But I'll remind you that in fourth quarter last year, we started to see the benefits of ocean freight. So it will moderate considerably in fourth quarter. But again, to answer -- third quarter versus second quarter should be comparable on that standpoint. From a domestic freight standpoint, again, we commented in the call on 60 basis points of good news, assuming fuel costs stay the same, we'd expect that to continue through the balance of 2023. Other big movers, we've commented a lot about incentive cost. We knew that would be a headwind coming into the year as we outperform this year and go up against an underperforming 2022. So that was a big moving part, and that will continue in the third quarter and fourth quarter, but would also comment the way we flowed incentive costs last year's second quarter was the most impactful quarter. So it'll still be a significant headwind, but in third quarter and fourth quarter, but not as significant as second quarter.Michael J. HartshornMatthew, on the long-term growth algorithm. We still believe we can achieve gradual improvement in profitability over time. In general, EBIT growth, though, will be highly dependent on sustained strong sales growth and certainly how the macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including inflation may continue to unfold. To achieve this, obviously, strengthening our price value offerings across our entire assortment is going to be key to that success. I'd say outside top line, we continue to believe there are opportunities throughout the P&amp;L that can help drive comp growth and EBIT margin expansion over time.Adam M. OrvosAnd I think you also asked markdown so we didn't answer that question. So given the elevated levels last fall, should expect some benefit as we move through the second half, obviously, assuming we deliver our sales expectations.Matthew Robert BossGreat color. Congrats again.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.Lorraine Corrine Maikis HutchinsonI wanted to focus on SG&amp;A for a minute. Understanding this year, there's a rebuild of incentive comp. How are you thinking about that line item over the longer term? And what comp would you expect to need to leverage SG&amp;A in the out years? .Adam M. OrvosLorraine, this is Adam. So SG&amp;A, we knew would be pressured due to incentive costs coming into this year, and it clearly was. But most of our SG&amp;A deleverage in the second quarter was driven by incentive costs, although higher store wages played a part in that. Also I think your kind of longer-term leverage question, 4% comp is where we think we can clearly lever in SG&amp;A, and that fundamentally hasn't changed for us.Lorraine Corrine Maikis HutchinsonAnd then any change to your outlook on wage pressures either for this year or for the coming years? .Michael J. HartshornSure, Lorraine. Generally speaking, wages in our stores and DCs are relatively stable. So there was no change to the outlook for 2023. We continue to take a market-by-market approach to staffing and we do adjust wages where appropriate in individual markets. I say longer term, I think it's going to be dependent on the statutory environment that's really what's driven our wage growth over the last few years.Operator(Operator Instructions)And the next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird.Mark R. AltschwagerBack to the top line for a moment, just with the positive inflection you're seeing in comps, what's your level of confidence that the business can return to a 3%, 3% plus next year? And bigger picture, do you think you've hit the point where the value is resonating in a way that it can trump the inflationary pressure your consumer is feeling elsewhere. I guess, asked another way, tough times is when we would think more customers would need Ross and the trade down can drive the top line. Do you think that's where we are today?Michael J. HartshornHere's how I'd answer that. Generally speaking, we can control what we can control. We know that we made some progress improving our assortments during the second quarter. We also know there's -- we can make significantly more improvements. And with that, I think that gives us confidence or that we can continue to grow comp. Longer term, when we start talking about next year, I think we'll be in a better position to see what the outlook is when we give our earnings guidance early next year. So we'll continue to monitor the economy. It still remains very uncertain, and we'll do what we can to offer the customer the best possible value possible in this environment, which is very important to our customers.Barbara RentlerI think the other piece, Mark, is that if we continue to improve on our value offerings, we really think that, that's the way to gain share across all customer income demographics. So if we do a good, better, best strategy, and we have incredible values, we have more of an opportunity to gain more customers.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.Charles P. GromCan you guys hear me?Adam M. OrvosWe can.Charles P. GromI wanted to see if you guys are talking about the home category a little bit. You called out cosmetics and accessories being areas of strength, your largest peer at the end of the day, you talked about home being strong. And I was wondering if you could talk about that and also tie in what's happened with the bath.Barbara RentlerI'm sorry. I didn't catch the last piece you said. With?Charles P. GromIf you could just tie in any benefit you think you saw in the quarter and could expect to see in the coming quarters from bed, bath and beyond.Barbara RentlerFrom bed, bath and beyond. Okay, sorry. Home also performed above the chain average. And so we feel that there's a lot of growth still left in home for us, pretty broad-based across the board. In terms of bed, bath and beyond, two thoughts. One is that they lost a lot of volume prior to that even happening and the classification that they carried where we have overlap. I think over time, we could pick up more volume perhaps, but I think that's very hard to measure. And you have to have overlap of the locations. So I think there's some opportunity how to measure that. I'm not really sure how to measure it. I think of it more as a total home package. We feel like we have a lot of growth in home still ahead of us. And again, I think that's pretty broad-based.Charles P. GromAnd just as a quick follow-up. Do you like the home category is starting to form a base after several quarters now of attrition?Barbara RentlerYou mean specifically to us or you mean in the world.Charles P. GromI guess both because it seems like more people are starting to talked about the home category starting to form the bottom.Barbara RentlerYes. Look, I think it depends on where you are in your development of the home business. So we have some businesses that are more developed than others. And so I think as we develop some of those other businesses, it will help us to continue to grow that as opposed to if we were in every business and everything was developed. So all businesses within our home business are not created equal. And so I think, Ross, we still see opportunity. In terms of the outside world, yes, there are a lot of people in home, and it goes back to what you're offering. So if I take the whole value equation for us in the entire box that would include home and making sure that we have the right values to continue to grow that business and then to maximize the areas where we are still what I would call underdeveloped.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup.Paul Lawrence LejuezCurious how dd's performed relative to Ross. I think you said you saw improvement at both. But curious on an absolute basis how dd's performed. I think it's been underperforming for about a year now. And so also curious if you think that underperformance continues or perhaps do easier comparisons cause dd's to start to outperform the Ross concept just whatever is built into your assumption?Michael J. HartshornPaul, I would say, as we mentioned in the commentary, dd's performance also improved during the quarter versus first quarter, and we believe that's a combination of better assortments and like Ross moderating inflation. That said, dd's sales trends continued to trail Ross. As a reminder, the dd's average household income is more impacted by the inflation, especially on necessities, their average household income is $40,000 to $45,000 compared to $60,000 to $65,000 for Ross. Our strategy here is very similar. We are very focused on offering strong values, which is very important to the dd's customer today.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays.Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantGreat. Thank you very much. Barbara, I wanted to ask you about the packaway merchandise. I mean, a shade lower than last year. I was just wondering if you can talk about how much of that packaway is actually short stay intra-season versus kind of annualized, I know you tend to do more of the short stay. And then the supply chain sort of being unlocked. Obviously, I would assume that, that allows you to play in that kind of short stay much more effectively. My second just follow-up question is on the direct import side, you don't do as much direct imports. So I'm just curious how much of the ocean -- sort of the model mix ocean air versus domestic, right? Sort of that outbound, I suppose, rail trucking. Is that rail trucking the domestic portion of it outweighing the ocean air, if I could ask that.Michael J. HartshornI'll answer the question on the transportation. Ocean freight, despite the fact that direct imports is a smaller part of our business, Ocean freight had a larger impact than the domestic transportation. The domestic transportation, you can see it separately within our gross margin was driven by better rates, but within the year, fuel rates have come down versus our expectations, which is where we saw a benefit in the first quarter -- our second quarter, sorry.Barbara RentlerAnd then in terms of short stays of packaway, it means the mix of what we would define or guess what you're defining as longer stays versus short stays of product. And that very much depends on when you're buying, right? So if you're buying packaway for next year, that would be something that would be happening more along the lines of this -- kind of this time frame. So again, there's always a mix and it fluctuates based off of what we find, what we want to pack, what that looks like. So there's no formula to that. It's really about what's the best possible deal, the possible value we can get for the customers. So that moves around. But it is a combination of both. And at this particular time, it's kind of like you haven't necessarily put out all your call, and you haven't necessarily put in all your spring if you were talking on the apparel side. The supply chain unlock in terms of a short stay in the hotel, are you implying on our direct imports or you implying in the outside world?Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantIn either. Probably both, if you can share that? .Barbara RentlerYes. So the short stays in terms of putting in the hotel, we don't necessarily put goods that we bring in ourselves in the hotel in any big way unless we have to. Now a year ago, when we handle the carrier issues. Obviously, the goods arrived early, we took the goods in, we released them. Sometimes we do -- we put goods in there for short stays for a variety of reasons. Container side, there's a variety of reasons why we do it. But it's not something that we like to do as a big -- as a large strategy in home with our own imports, but we do, do some.So the supply chain timing of the unlock for, I'll call it, business as usual prior to the casual, the carrier issues. Again, we manage that very closely. It really was last year in this time frame where all those goods came in, we had to put it in and then metered out at the appropriate time for the customer. Otherwise, we would have been off seasonality and a variety of other issues along with that.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.Brooke Siler RoachBarbara, you talked about the opportunity to continue to improve your assortment as you move forward following some early gains. Was there any change in your mix this quarter between good, better, best. And how are you planning those buys between the assortment of good, better, best into the second half of the year?Barbara RentlerChange in good, better, best. I don't really think there was a significant change in our good, better, best strategy. Best has been out there in the market a while. There's been a lot of availability. So a lot of what for this past quarter that would have affected what you would have seen on the floor in terms of the three buckets was the amount of merchandise that we chased based -- and the availability in the market. And so since the availability in the market is pretty broad-based between good, better, best, I mean, as usual, not every class, every price point. I think the assortments are more reflective of what we've been able to chase. And I would say the same thing for fall. Obviously, we have a strategy around balance. But when you're chasing as much as we're chasing, that kind of really goes to what the customer is voting on, and what we can get in the market. And I think the merchants in Q2 did a very good job of getting values on the floor, chasing back into more of what you wanted and trying to hit the appropriate levels of each one of those buckets because the customer votes every day. So we could want a particular good, better, best on the floor. That's not necessarily what the customer wants. So I think the merchants have really been out in the market and really, really looking for great deals, which have been out there. And so it fluctuates. And I would expect it would fluctuate in Q3 and Q4. But we are looking for each one of those buckets and great deals in all of them.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.Dana Lauren TelseyNice to see the nice results. As you think about the current environment, I believe last time, Barbara, you had mentioned the focus on value that the consumers are searching for and you could do a better job of it. How much is the improvement that we saw this quarter? Is the comparison given the increase in traffic, how much of it was the consumer? And how much of it on your journey of better value for better brands? How much of it is your progress there? And where are you versus relative to where you want to be? And then just any updates on new store productivity levels, how those are doing versus your plan?Michael J. HartshornDana, on the productivity levels, they haven't changed. They've averaged between 60% and 65% of an average mature store for the chain, and that has not changed over time.Barbara RentlerI'll talk about traffic.Michael J. HartshornTraffic. So on traffic -- your question on traffic. So traffic was the main driver of the comp for the quarter.Barbara RentlerAnd where is the customer on the journey. Look, I think the customer with moderating inflation is feeling a little bit little bit more room to spend money. But again, our customer is moderate to low income customers. So they still faces inflation in front of her because she has just the higher cost of the necessity she has to spend. So I think on our journey with the customer in terms of better value and better values on the floor, I think, it's a continual process, right? The customer votes and the merchants are out buying goods and responding to what she's voting on. So I think from -- in second quarter versus first quarter, I think the merchant team did a better job of offering her broader assortments and better values.And I think we'll continue to make progress on that, and it will seek its own level. It's not really a target or a level that we have in mind. It's just how the customer responds. And obviously, we want to put out the best possible values we always can. And so the merchants have that mind and now they have really heightened awareness and the ability to chase goods has really given us an opportunity to perhaps accelerate some of those things. So again, it will continue. I don't have a beginning or an end amount that we think you should ask because I think the customer will decide for us and our job and the merchant team's job is to respond to that and satisfy her on whatever level that is.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley.Alexandra Ann StratonGreat. Congrats on a nice quarter. I wanted to talk about the competitive landscape. On our end, we've witnessed the rise of these low-priced e-commerce players in recent years like even Shein. So I'm just wondering like how maybe, Barbara, you think about those types of businesses, what they mean for Ross or even how the competitive landscape has changed now versus a few years ago?Barbara RentlerSure. Well, obviously, Shein's doing a lot of business, and they offer great value. We have a -- our junior business is a pretty large business for us in ladies apparel. So I think that would be most comparable. I don't think I can really compare myself to Shein. I think the reality of it is there's a lot more competition in that arena, whether it's Shein, whether it's Primark, whether -- so I think it's just our job to be able to offer assortments that satisfy the customer. And again, they're just like another competitor. In terms of -- if you think about all the competitors, right? Department stores years ago had a lot more share so that would have been a major competitor for us. I think -- I mean, you would know better than I would know, you're watching the world evolve and different segments of the market are more challenging than others. And so I think one of the best parts about being in off-price is that we have a unique opportunity to satisfy all types of customers. This is why we want the assortments to be broad. This is why we want the values to be strong. And everyone keeps asking about the trade down customer. I think just getting more customers is really by broadening your assortment. And I think off-price has a unique opportunity to do that, versus if I mean, another particular segment. So if the merchants obviously study Shein, they study all the other retailers and their job is to understand what they offer and what we can offer and to give the best product and the best value that we can. And I think there's been -- if we looked at this and had this discussion 10 years ago, it would be a very different discussion than where we are today. So retailing is -- I think we probably all agree dynamic. And so -- but I do believe that off-price has this unique opportunity because it carries lots of products, and it has the ability to flex based off of the customer and you're not kind of pigeonholed into one view of who you are, you can flex and move with what the customer wants. So I think off-price is in the right place at the right time.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.Unidentified AnalystThis is Julianna on for Ike. Congrats on a good quarter. Maybe just a quick follow-up on AUR. Is the moderation we're seeing there more result of mix shift towards cosmetic and accessories. For example, we saw this quarter. And as we see home performance improving, do you see that driving an upside there?Michael J. HartshornOn the AUR, it was a combination of mix shift and us providing better values to the customer. The way we think about it going forward is we really don't plan the business on traffic or transactions. We think if we offer the best values that will have an impact on both traffic and basket size. AURs will fundamentally be dependent on the mix of sales in the business.Barbara RentlerAnd in terms of home, listen, I feel like we -- what I said, we have opportunity in home. And so that compared to the company is there are upside versus other businesses, I think, over time. Home is not -- home is longer lead time type businesses and things, but I do believe there is upside.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with The Retail Tracker.Marni ShapiroCongratulations on a great quarter. I'm curious, in most of your regions or a lot of your regions, students are back-to-school. I'm curious if you saw early pickup for traffic for back-to-school and what the trends were looking like? And just in general, I'm curious if you guys are seeing sort of the peaks and valleys in your traffic around holidays where holiday weekends or holiday events, the traffic is much higher. And when it's in the valley, it's lower? Or has it evened out a little bit?Michael J. HartshornHi, Marni, we wouldn't talk about intra-quarter trends for back-to-school. In terms of traffic, I would say in our business, it's been very steady versus peaks and valleys that you mentioned.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital Markets.Laura Allyson ChampineI noted that this was the third quarter in a row of inventories down double digits, which seems just to be normalization. But do you have enough inventory in your opinion, given the current improvement in sales trend?Michael J. HartshornLaura. Yes, the reduction in inventory was down 15%, as we mentioned in the release, and that was really about the comparison versus last year where we had as Barbara mentioned, substantial amount of early receipts that we had to store in our packaway facilities and also higher end transit inventory. So we're up against those larger numbers last year. We feel good about our overall inventory levels. We actually ended up 4% in our stores. So I would say, overall, the level and content of the inventory we're happy with.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Edward Yruma with Piper Sandler.Edward James YrumaJust quickly, I know you cited strength in cosmetics and accessories. Kind of curious on inventory availability there if you're chasing there. Obviously, there's a proposed M&amp;A in this space, would that impact, in your opinion, kind of accessory availability long term? And then just a model housekeeping question. I noticed that accrued payrolls were up pretty materially year-over-year and sequentially. Any driver you'd like to call out there would be great.Adam M. OrvosOn the last piece, accrued payroll, it's really our financial performance. So incentive costs are up. And when you look at that this year versus last year comparison.Barbara RentlerAnd I just want to make sure on the cosmetic and accessory question, you want to know what the availability is.Edward James YrumaYes. Just kind of curious if you're seeing good product in the market and if you're willing to opine on this M&amp;A that may happen in the space, like would that hamper your availability in accessory space longer term?Barbara RentlerLook, there's availability in almost every market, as I said in the beginning, I mean, not every class in every business in every market has availability. But both cosmetics and accessories have availabilities just depending upon what it is you're looking for. The second piece of the question, I'm not sure...Michael J. HartshornWe wouldn't comment on the M&amp;A in the market.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein.Aneesha ShermanSo similar to last quarter, your new guidance also models a comp acceleration on a 4-year stack. Can you talk about what makes you confident about that acceleration going into the second half? Is it more about external factors like inflation moderating? Or is it about internal execution and bringing a better product to the market? And then second, some other discount retailers have talked this week about absorbing inflation and doing price rollbacks for back-to-school. Do you expect fall and back-to-school to become quite promotional across the sector?Michael J. HartshornOn the guidance, Aneesha, I think it's a function of how we performed in the second quarter and our confidence in the assortments we're providing the customer. I'd say that's what's driving our guidance in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we actually see a deceleration, and we'll update that as we get closer. We think the fourth quarters could be a very promotional holiday season.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies.Corey TarloweYou talked about cosmetics and accessories and a little bit on home. I was wondering if you could also touch on footwear and apparel, anything you're seeing there? How did that perform relative to the chain average? And then just on real estate, what's the availability look like? And is there any impact that you're seeing as you look down your real estate pipeline in terms of the impact from potentially higher rates on -- higher interest rates on either rental agreements or returns that you're seeing?Michael J. HartshornSure. Merchant-wise, let me talk about the category performance. Merchandise-wise, cosmetics and accessories, as we mentioned, we're again the best performing businesses. Shoes and Home were above the chain average. Apparel trailed the chain, although it performed above our plan and improved versus Q1. .On real estate availability, I'd say, overall, there's been an increased interest from other retailers and the types of real estate that we typically prefer. That said, our team has a very methodical process of developing a healthy real estate pipeline to support our long-term growth plans. And in terms of rent, obviously, we're under contract and have option renewals, and we're not seeing, at this point, major increases in our rent costs.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of John Kernan with TD Cowen.Krista Kerr ZuberThis is Krista Zuber on behalf of John. Just given the still broadly highly promotional environment across retail heading into the second half in your sharper value proposition. I wonder if you could just talk to rather broadly or directionally, how you see sort of your merchandise margin in relation to your Q3 operating margin guidance.Adam M. OrvosKrista, merchandise margin will continue to be primarily driven by ocean freight benefit. I mentioned earlier, we'll have a little bit of tailwind just from as we had elevated markdown levels, that will be helped to us. And really, that's all we see as major moving components within merchandise margin.OperatorWe have time for one final question coming from the line of Jay Sole with UBS.Jay Daniel SoleI guess if you just take a step back and just give us an idea of how the overall inventory buying environment compares right now to a year ago? Because if you go back a year ago, it was really a time where a lot of retailers and just the whole industry realized how much excess inventory had been built up post reopening and I think sort of the slowdown as inflation really started to kick in. So could you just give us an idea of how you think about the environment now relative to them? Is it as good? Is it better? Is it a little bit worse? Is it a lot worse? Any kind of context there would be helpful.Barbara RentlerThere was a lot of availability last year, and there's a lot of availability now. And again, it's broad-based, obviously, again, not every single classification of business. But there is definitely supply, it was there last year and it's there again this year.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Barbara Rentler for any closing comments.Barbara RentlerThank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores.OperatorThis concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.]"

182,f98a12d8-9eb2-389f-add5-7c0b9de473e4,SBAC,2023-08-19,SBA Communications (SBAC) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sba-communications-sbac-incredible-growth-164506736.html,1692377106,STORY,['SBAC'],"[Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends SBA Communications (SBAC) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this communications tower operator is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for SBA Communications is 12.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 5.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -0.6%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for SBA Communications is 14.8%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 9.4%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 8.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 4.5%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for SBA Communications. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3.3% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made SBA Communications a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions SBA Communications well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Marriott has an S/TA ratio of 0.92, which means that the company gets $0.92 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.5, it can be said that the company is more efficient.In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role.

187,e7cb9dd9-0eb1-3bb8-aa1c-3c05c2225b44,VZ,2023-08-19,"As Hurricane Hilary approaches the West Coast, Verizon is ready",GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hurricane-hilary-approaches-west-coast-195000280.html,1692388200,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Sourcing LLCLOS ANGELES, Aug. 18, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- With Hurricane Hilary expected to make landfall in Southern California this weekend, Verizon’s team is working to ensure its people and assets are ready to be deployed at a moment’s notice to assist with rapid recovery efforts of critical communications infrastructure. With the expectation of record rainfall and possible flooding from the storm, Verizon’s network team is preparing for the worst. While the use of battery and generator backup systems in critical locations such as cell sites and network operations centers serve to minimize the risk of disruption if commercial power is lost, even the most hardened infrastructure can be shaken by Mother Nature.In case emergency network recovery becomes necessary after Hurricane Hilary makes landfall, Verizon is prepared to respond quickly. Verizon has readied its fleet of portable assets, including fully functional, generator-powered cell sites that can replace or enhance network coverage and capacity in a given area as well as drones and a fixed wing aircraft that can provide service and situational awareness from the sky above. Additionally, Verizon has pre-staged satellite-based portable network assets that can provide an alternate way to connect cell sites to the rest of the network in the event that a fiber cable is lost due to commercial power outages or physical damage. All of these mobile assets are complemented by portable generators and a comprehensive refueling program ready to keep the network running in case of commercial power outages.Are you ready for the storm?Verizon’s retail team stands ready to assist customers and ensure they have the right devices, accessories and connectivity they’ll need to weather the storm. And convenient options like locker, curbside and in store pickup provide quick ways to get what you need and get out.In addition to the right tech, you’ll also want to take steps to ensure your family is prepared for the season as well. When a storm is forecast:Story continuesKeep devices dry: While many phones today are some degree of water resistant, you still want to take some extra care to ensure phones, tablets, batteries, chargers and other equipment remain dry and accessible. Plastic zipper storage bags help shield devices, and there are weatherproof phones, phone cases and other protective accessories available.Keep devices fully charged: Make sure your device is ready when you need it by keeping phone and tablet batteries fully charged in case commercial power goes out.Get some backup: When power is out for an extended period of time, portable battery packs can be a game-changer to ensure you remain connected. Don’t forget your car chargers as well in case you need to evacuate.Create a list: Keep a list of emergency numbers in your phone so that you have them if needed.Be prepared for loss: Take pictures of valuables and other important belongings for possible insurance claims and make sure they’re uploaded to the cloud so you have a backup.Review checklists: Review the hurricane preparedness checklist, power outage checklist and other resources from the American Red Cross.Download useful apps: There are plenty of free weather, news, and safety-related apps available for download to your smartphone.Business continuity is criticalThe need for a secure, reliable connection for business continuity is never more apparent than during severe weather events and other emergencies. This is especially important with today’s increasingly common hybrid-work environments, in which highly distributed and mobile workforces rely on remote collaboration and digital networking tools to conduct business across wide and local areas simultaneously.The Verizon Business portfolio of solutions and partners provides continuity of service for customers of all sizes from the largest enterprise to the small business that is the heart of the community. From SD-WAN, to advanced security tools, to cloud and edge applications, fleet management and tracking through Verizon Connect, fixed-wireless Internet for primary or backup connectivity. Verizon’s network-as-a-service strategy gives customers the flexibility to scale services as they require so that they’re ready for anything.In an emergency situation, agility is vital, so as businesses launch their in-office and at-home hybrid operations, now is a great time to assess readiness plans ahead of storm season. Suggested steps for businesses and government organizations include:Make sure you have contact information updated and readily available for all employees, including at-home information for remote workers and branch information for satellite offices.Stress-test primary and backup networks and shore up any weak areas.Make copies of insurance documents, review insurance coverages and update as appropriate.Ensure employees working from home have documented all corporate equipment being used to work from home in case of damage or loss.Ensure backup plans are in place to shift work in case work-from-home employees in a storm-impacted area have to evacuate their home or their home loses commercial power.Verizon Frontline is ready to support first respondersThe Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team stands ready to deploy in support of public safety agencies — at no cost to the supported agencies — to ensure they have the mission-critical communications support they need when responding to severe weather and other crisis events.This year alone, the team has responded to more than 1,000 requests for communications support from more than 500 federal, state and local public safety agencies in 47 states and the District of Columbia. They have delivered nearly 4,000 Verizon Frontline solutions to these agencies to help provide mission-critical voice and data service to first responders on the front lines.Composed primarily of former first responders and military veterans, the Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team provides on-demand, emergency assistance during crisis situations to public safety agencies and emergency responders. The team is available 24/7 to deliver Verizon Frontline technologies including portable cell sites, drones, charging stations, WiFi hotspots, and other Verizon Frontline devices and solutions that enable communications and/or boost network performance.Verizon Frontline is the advanced network and technology built for first responders – developed over nearly three decades of partnership with public safety officials and agencies on the front lines – to meet their unique and evolving needs.After an emergency, call before you digDebris clean up and property repair are important tasks after a storm. Before beginning to clean up and make repairs, call 811 or visit call811.com to determine where fiber or other cables are buried. Contacting 811 before any digging project, large or small, is the easiest step toward reducing the chance of damaging underground fiber and keeping customers and first responders connected in critical moments. Fiber is the invisible footprint that moves data throughout Verizon’s network across the country and around the world. Verizon owns and operates over 1 million miles of fiber; that’s enough to wrap around Earth 40 times. Cutting those cables when digging can result in customers losing service and data connections being lost. So before storm clean up begins, call 811.**Editor’s Note: To access images and b-roll of past storms, Verizon equipment, recovery efforts and more, please visit Verizon’s Media Resource Hub at https://www.verizon.com/about/news/media-resources.

I'd now like to turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry's CEO. Joanne Crevoiserat: Good morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, we achieved record EPS this fiscal year, reinforcing the power of brand building, consumer-centric strategies and disciplined execution. Importantly, we meaningfully advanced our strategic priorities, engaging with consumers around the world through product excellence, unique storytelling and distinctive omnichannel experiences. At the same time, we continue to invest in our brands and our data-rich consumer engagement platform, which underpin our growth agenda. I want to thank our talented global teams for continuing to drive our strong results. Touching on the strategic and financial highlights for the year. First, we powered global growth achieving 3% constant currency revenue gains consistent with our outlook and underscoring the benefits of our globally diversified business model. These top line results were led by our international businesses, which grew 13% excluding FX. This included a 5% increase in Greater China despite facing incremental COVID-related pressures in the first half of the year. Importantly, our business in China rebounded in the second half achieving 50% growth in the fourth quarter supported by a strong improvement in traffic and representing an increase compared to the region's peak fiscal '21 levels. Our international results were also fueled by strong momentum in Other Asia with sales growth of 36% as well as in Japan, where revenue rose 15%. In Europe, sales increased 7% for the year. In North America, sales for the year declined low-single digits against a challenging consumer backdrop. In the fourth quarter, our business decreased 8% versus last year, though, we delivered significant gross margin improvement and handbag AUR growth, consistent with our commitments to prioritize long-term brand health. Importantly, our business in North America has improved meaningfully on a sequential basis quarter-to-date in Q1 with revenue trending in line with prior year on continued higher margins as we began to anniversary easier comparisons. Second, we continue to focus on building new and lasting customer relationships. To this end, we acquired approximately 6.5 million new customers in North America alone during the fiscal year. Importantly, these new customers transacted at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base and approximately half were Millennial and Gen Z consistent with our strategy to attract younger consumers to our brands. Third, we delivered seamless omnichannel experiences, harnessing the power of our direct-to-consumer business model and highlighting our ability to meet consumers where they are shopping. We drove 3% growth in direct-to-consumer sales on a constant currency basis. This was led by mid-single digit growth in brick-and-mortar sales as we welcome an increasing number of consumers to our stores. In addition, we maintained our strong positioning in digital. While sales were down slightly compared to the prior year, revenues still represented nearly 30% of sales, approximately 3 times pre-pandemic levels. Importantly, we enhanced our capabilities this year, bringing all of our brands on a unified digital enterprise platform. Fourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence informed by data analytics and consumer research. To this end, we drove handbag AUR growth globally and in North America for both the quarter and the year. We also delivered outsized top line gains in our small leather goods and lifestyle offerings, key to enhancing brand relevance and fueling customer value over time. Taken together, we generated record fiscal year earnings per share, increasing at a double-digit rate compared to the prior year, which we accomplished despite a volatile demand backdrop and currency headwinds. This included a strong finish to our year with EPS growth of over 20% in the fourth quarter. Overall, our fiscal '23 results reinforce the meaningful progress we've made in differentiating our brands and our business. Further, our performance highlights our agility and the advantages of our model, underscoring our confidence in our ability to drive sustainable, profitable growth. Now turning to the highlights across each of our brands, starting with Coach. At the start of the year, we introduced our brand positioning of expressive luxury, laying the groundwork for deeper customer connections. Our team has brought this concept to life through impactful marketing campaigns, unique retail experiences and relevant and innovative product designs. As a result, the brand delivered revenue of nearly $5 billion on stronger operating margin, fueled by a material improvement in gross margin. Now touching on some of the details of the fourth quarter. We built on the momentum of our leather goods offering, reinforcing our icons to drive consumer engagement. We innovated across our key families, Tabby, Willow, Field and Rogue by introducing new iterations and launching strong go-to-market activations. Tabby outperformed expectations with notable success in our shoulder bag. Additionally, we have seen strong results from extensions of the family into small leather goods, including a wristlet and chain clutch, both of which over-indexed among younger customers. Willow continued to be a volume driving style, while the Rogue family fueled stronger AUR aided by animations, including our Tea Rose. The introduction of Field tote and washed signature denim was a success, which bodes well for our various denim introductions in the year ahead. Our innovative product supported by data and consumer insights throughout the creation process, fueled a low-double digit gain in global handbag AUR at constant currency, including an increase in North America. Importantly, we see continued runway for pricing increases into fiscal year '24, given our commitment to expanding gross margin as well as benefits from outsized growth in higher AUR international markets. Next, we focused our marketing investments on brand-building activities, connecting emotionally with customers through the unique purpose of the brand. This spring in North America, we supported the important Mother's Day holiday with a two-pronged marketing approach. First, we led with content from Gen Z creators, highlighting Coach is a gifting destination. We followed this with an iconic Mother's Day campaign featuring Jennifer Lopez. Overall, our marketing activities helped to support the acquisition of over 900,000 new customers in North America in the fourth quarter or approximately 3.9 million for the fiscal year. Turning to Greater China. We saw strong growth in brand momentum, delivering a 50% top line gain versus last year, excluding FX. In the quarter, we continued to recruit new customers with our product offering resonating with the younger consumers. This further supports our optimism for the future of this market. Moving to lifestyle. We drove a strong top line increase in the offering, an area of long-term opportunity for the brand. In ready-to-wear, we continue to see success, delivering mid-single digit constant currency growth fueled by success in our branded denim options and T-shirt assortment. In men's, we delivered outsized growth driven by leather goods, including the successful launch of a cross grain leather program. At the same time, our Gotham, Charter and League families remained top sellers. And finally, we created omnichannel experiences that resonate with consumers by communicating our brand purpose, the courage to be real through self-expression. As such, we continued to roll out multi-sensory immersive concepts. This included the extension of In My Tabby activations with bespoke events and pop-ups across the globe. And in Malaysia, we launched Coach Airways, a full takeover of a retired airplane featuring our brand codes, a coach cafe and content creation opportunities throughout. Looking ahead to fiscal year '24, we're building on our success, focused on: first, deepening our connection with consumers, utilizing data to drive experiences that enrich a customers' life building a stronger long-term connection. Second, growing leather goods by animating our icons and Hero families, including the introduction of new sizes and hardware while continuing to focus on maintaining a productive assortment. Third, fueling gains across lifestyle by establishing more evergreen wardrobe essentials that align with the younger timeless Coach aesthetic. Fourth, leading with purpose-led storytelling through high impact and sustained brand building campaigns, including the distortion of investments toward a younger generation, notably through digital innovation. And fifth, building momentum in our sub-brand Coachtopia with a focus on attracting a new Gen Z consumer. Coachtopia is off to a strong start, garnering significant consumer attention. While still a small portion of the assortment, it is tracking a year ahead of our original projections. In closing, Coach is just getting started. Our success is rooted in a blend of magic and logic, and we're building on our strong foundation with a clear strategy to deliver another year of growth in fiscal year '24. We are confident in the opportunity to deliver continued healthy growth for years to come. Now moving to Kate Spade. During the year, we advanced our strategic initiatives, navigating near-term external headwinds while keeping a sharp focus on our long-term objectives. We delivered revenue of $1.4 billion, in line with the prior year on a constant currency basis despite a more challenging backdrop in North America. To this end, we drove strong international growth, underscoring opportunity for the brand. Further, we expanded gross margin, a key element of our strategic and financial strategy and have delivered over two years of handbag AUR gains in keeping with our focus on elevating the brand. At the same time, we also made foundational investments in the brand that position us for the future. Having said that, we are clear eyed about our path forward and the higher aspirations we have for the brand. We entered the current fiscal year front footed with focus and actions that build upon our progress and leverage the investments we've made to drive accelerated top and bottom line growth in fiscal year '24 and beyond. Turning to details of the fourth quarter. First, we remain focused on delivering an innovative and distinctive handbag offering. The Knott remains the top global handbag group, followed by the recently expanded Hudson family, which now includes options and whipstitch and straw. In addition, the iconic Sam bag, which was a pillar of the brand's 30th anniversary celebration, continued to deliver growth and resonated with both new and existing customers. As we move forward, we will further strengthen the brand's core handbag foundation. I'll touch on these strategies in a moment. Turning to novelty, which outperformed expectations as we bring heightened emotion to the brand. The Shell collection was a highlight of the fourth quarter, significantly outpacing expectations across categories. It drove engagement with younger consumers, resulting in strong full price sell-throughs and high margins. Overall, our product initiatives, coupled with our use of data to deepen our understanding of consumer preferences, supported low-single digit handbag AUR growth, both globally and in North America, demonstrating our commitment to brand building for the long term. Importantly, we achieved this against the North America backdrop that was more challenging than expected, resulting in conversion and traffic headwinds, notably in the brand's value channels. To navigate the external challenges, we moved quickly. We successfully accelerated new product launches helping to drive a material improvement in Q1 revenue trends, which are now roughly in line with last year. Next, we advanced our strategy to become more lifestyle with momentum in jewelry and footwear. We continue to see that customers who shop across categories are our highest value customers. demonstrating the importance of the brand's lifestyle offering as a long-term growth driver. In keeping with this strategy, we delivered an increase in average spend per customer in the quarter and the year. Now touching on marketing. We expressed the world of Kate Spade through unique storytelling and messaging connected to the brand's purpose and values, creating authentic consumer engagement. We invested in our brand codes globally, creating activations behind our Kate Spade Green and iconic dots and stripes, which are distinctive and key to driving brand awareness and global consistency. At the same time, we remain focused on women's empowerment through the lens of mental health, highlighted by our partnership with the Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation, which provides mental health services to women at HBCUs. Overall, our marketing helped to support the recruitment of approximately 500,000 new customers in North America for the quarter or approximately 2.4 million customers for the year. And finally, in keeping with our priority of becoming more global, we drove double-digit international gains at constant currency, underscoring the growth potential of the brand. Importantly, we fueled strong growth in China, where the brand has significant runway based on its relatively low awareness and small distribution footprint. At the same time, we launched marketing activations internationally, including pop-ups in Japan and Thailand, as well as at Grand Gateway in Shanghai, which led us to securing a permanent location in that mall. We also continued the rollout of our new store concept, which began earlier in the year with the Marina Bay Sands store in Singapore, where we continue to outperform. Since then, we have expanded the concept further to more than 20 doors across the globe, creating a compelling brand experience. Now turning to our priorities at Kate Spade for fiscal '24 in keeping with our long-term strategies. First, we are focused on strengthening our core handbag foundation with a goal of developing more global key items building a strong branded signature platform and continuing to provide innovation that supports ongoing AUR growth. We're excited to launch our new Dakota handbag collection this fall, which features new hardware and will be the hero product story in our marketing campaigns. And this quarter, as mentioned, we accelerated the introduction of a new core collection in outlet, the Madison, which is driving an improvement in top line trends at accretive margins. Second, we'll continue to fuel the lifestyle offering led by growth in jewelry, which represents both a revenue and margin driver for the brand. Third, we'll invest in marketing to drive both acquisition and retention, continuing to build relationships with younger customers. Fourth, we will focus on the omnichannel opportunity by driving in-store productivity, including accelerating lifestyle and small leather goods. At the same time, we will leverage our recent investments in our digital platform with a focus on enhancing our online experiences. Finally, we will grow in China where the business is small, though seeing rapid increases. During the fiscal year, we expect to open a net of approximately 10 locations on the mainland. We will also invest in marketing to drive awareness, including through KOL partnerships. In closing, we remain focused on cultivating what makes the Kate Spade brand unique and special. To do this, we will continue to prioritize brand building and forging strong emotional bonds with our customers while executing on high return initiatives that underpin our profitability goals. Importantly, we have a clear strategy and remain confident in the long-term opportunities for the brand. Turning to Stuart Weitzman. In the fiscal year, the brand was significantly impacted by the difficult external backdrop in China and North America. Improvement in the back half did not fully offset the impact of a slower China business in the first half. Despite these pressures, we focused on our long-term potential, maintaining brand health, which was underscored by gross margin expansion. Moving to the details of the fourth quarter. First, we curated a relevant offering of emotional product to spark desire. Our low first pumps and booties continue to perform in keeping with the broader consumer shift to casual and wear to work styles. Soho remained a top collection while we saw continued strength in the Stewart family of pumps. And our handbag collection, while still a small portion of the assortment drove engagement with both new and existing clients at high AUR and accretive margins. And we fueled brand heat by leveraging new marketing tactics to increase awareness. We focused on creating relevant marketing, including partnerships with influential social media creators to deliver our spring campaign. Importantly, this helped to drive a favorable brand impression among Millennials in the U.S. relative to last year per YouGov. Looking ahead to fiscal '24, we will increase marketing relevancy and drive brand consideration as we emotionally engage with our target consumers. Second, we will focus on driving growth in our core and iconic categories while adding depth to underpenetrated classifications that represent significant opportunity. This includes the launch of our extended sneaker assortment planned in the second quarter as well as expanded offering of flat, specifically trend right valet styles. Third, we will accelerate growth in China, leveraging deep customer affinity to maximize the impact of our brand through product and marketing investments. Importantly, we expect to benefit from the recovery of this highly profitable region this fiscal year, which represented nearly 40% of the brand sales in fiscal year '21. And finally, we will fuel digital by leveraging Tapestry's platform to improve the online shopping experience and better engage with consumers. Overall, we're sharpening our focus on the consumer and are committed to driving top and bottom line growth in fiscal '24 and beyond. In closing, building on our strong foundation, we are focused on the future. We remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver revenue and profit gains across our current portfolio where our runway is significant. Further, last week, we were excited to announce the planned acquisition of Capri Holdings, establishing a new powerful global house of luxury and fashion brands that expands our portfolio reach across consumer segments, geographies and product categories. By bringing together six iconic brands with a heritage and design and craftsmanship and leveraging our modern consumer engagement platform, we will drive greater innovation, consumer connectivity and cultural relevance creating superior value for our consumers, employees, communities and shareholders around the world. We look forward to closing the transaction and sharing more detailed strategies for the future at the appropriate time. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott, who will discuss our financial results, capital priorities and fiscal '24 outlook. Scott? Scott Roe: Thanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Looking back at our results for the fiscal year, we clearly demonstrated our financial discipline and agility. We powered global growth, delivering a 3% increase at constant currency, fueled by international. We increased gross margin by 120 basis points, and we grew earnings per share by 12% versus last year while continuing to invest in marketing and digital capabilities. Importantly, we returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders, demonstrating our strong cash flow generation and confidence in the future. Turning to the details of the fourth quarter. I'll begin with a discussion of revenue trends on a constant currency basis. Sales increased 1%, consistent with our guidance for low-single digit increase as 22% international growth was largely offset by pressure in North America given the difficult consumer backdrop. In Greater China, as anticipated, we delivered 50% revenue growth against last year's COVID impacted compare. This represented growth against our prior peak levels in 2021. And recently, we've seen an uptick in Chinese travel spend, specifically within Japan, Other Asia and Hong Kong and Macau and to a lesser extent, Europe. While these reads have been encouraging, sales to Chinese tourists globally remain below pre-pandemic levels, representing further opportunity ahead. In Japan, sales rose 12%, while Other Asia grew 7% with continued traction among local customers. Sales to tourists also improved versus the prior year, though remain below pre-pandemic levels. In Europe, revenue declined 13% as we lapped last year's 50% gains. And in North America, sales declined 8% given softer consumer demand. Importantly, despite the difficult backdrop, we delivered gross margin gains across brands, underscoring our disciplined approach to pricing. As Joanne mentioned, we've seen a sequential improvement in revenue trends Q1 to date, with the business now performing in line with prior year as we've begun to anniversary easier compares. Now touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business grew 2%, fueled by a low-single digit gain in stores. And in wholesale, revenue was 5% below the prior year, reflecting growth in international markets, offset by a decline in North America, which included a strategic reduction in off-price shipments as well as overall wholesale market pressure. Moving down the P&amp;L. We delivered gross margin ahead of our projection and 350 basis points above prior year. This year-over-year expansion included approximately 200 basis points of favorable freight expense, partially offset by 80 basis points of FX headwinds. Excluding these impacts, gross margin was well ahead of last year, fueled by operational outperformance, reflecting net pricing improvements and a tailwind related to the increased penetration of the higher margin China business. SG&amp;A rose 5%, in line with our expectations and including the anticipated timing shift of expenses from the third quarter into Q4, as previously discussed. We are continuing to reinvest in the business by prioritizing high return initiatives, notably platform investments and brand building activities to fuel long-term growth. Taken together, operating margin and operating income were ahead of the prior year and our fourth quarter EPS of $0.95 was in line with our guidance range, representing growth of 22%. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the year with $742 million in cash and investments and total borrowings of $1.66 billion. Free cash flow for the year was an inflow of $791 million, including CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing of $261 million. Inventory levels at year-end were 8% below prior year, reflecting our focus on driving higher inventory turn while delivering stronger gross margins. Inventory levels were favorable to our expectations due in part to receipt timing with Q1 fiscal '24. Entering the new year, we are pleased with the quantity and quality of inventory across all brands and geographies. Moving to shareholder returns. As anticipated, we returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year, which consisted of $700 million in share repurchases and dividend payments totaling $283 million for an annual dividend rate of $1.20 per share, which represented a payout ratio of 30%. Before turning to our go-forward expectations, I want to touch on the recent exciting announcement outlining the planned acquisition of Capri Holdings. This acquisition positions us to create significant value for shareholders with immediate accretion to adjusted earnings, enhanced cash flow and strong financial returns. While our current focus remains on the existing business, we've hired Ernst &amp; Young to lead our integration efforts alongside a dedicated internal team ahead of the estimated transaction close in calendar 2024. Now moving to our guidance for fiscal '24, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis and does not include any potential impact from the planned acquisition of Capri. For the fiscal year, we expect revenue to approach $6.9 billion, representing an increase of approximately 3% to 4% on both the reported and constant currency basis. Touching on sales details by region at constant currency. In North America, we anticipate slight growth for the fiscal year. This forecast reflects our commitment to maintaining promotional discipline and higher margins as we manage our brands and business for the long term. In Greater China, our outlook contemplates high-single digit growth, including outside strength in the first half as we lapped last year's COVID related headwinds. In Japan, we expect to grow high-single digits, while Other Asia is forecasted to increase at a high-teens rate. And in Europe, we anticipate high single-digit growth. In addition, our outlook includes a modest improvement in operating margin versus last year. We anticipate gross margin expansion to drive this increase, which includes a benefit from moderating freight costs with the most notable tailwind coming in the first quarter. On SG&amp;A expenses, we anticipate slight deleverage for the year, reflecting continued investments in growth driving initiatives across the portfolio. In light of the current environment, we're continuing to monitor our cost base and take proactive actions where needed. Moving to below-the-line expectations for the year. Net interest expense is anticipated to be approximately $20 million. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 20% and our weighted average diluted share count is forecasted to be in the area of 235 million shares. Taken together, we project EPS of $4.10 to $4.15 representing 6% to 7% growth versus last year. This takes into account our decision to suspend share repurchase activity due to the planned acquisition of Capri Holdings resulting in a $0.10 headwind versus our prior expectations. Finally, before contemplating any deal related costs, we would expect free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion and we forecast CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $220 million. We expect over half of this spend to be related to store openings, renovations and relocations mostly in Asia. The balance of the spend is primarily related to our ongoing digital and IT investments. Touching now on the shaping of the year. We expect relatively consistent top line growth between the first and second half of the year. As mentioned, we see the opportunity for gross margin expansion for the year, with the most significant improvement in Q1, benefiting from lower freight expense versus the prior year. SG&amp;A growth is expected to be higher in the first half relative to the second half based on the pace of investments. Taken together, while we expect operating income growth to be relatively balanced between the halves, we would anticipate EPS growth to be front-half weighted, primarily due to the phasing of our share count and tax rate assumptions. This contemplates first quarter earnings per share to approach $0.90, representing a low double-digit growth rate. Now to outline our capital allocation priorities looking forward, which are consistent with those shared in our acquisition announcement last week. First, we will continue to invest in our brands and businesses to support sustainable growth. Second, we will utilize our strong free cash flow for rapid debt repayment. We're committed to maintaining a solid investment-grade rating. We've also initiated a long-term leverage target of under 2.5 times on a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis and expect to achieve that within two years of the transaction close. Finally, we will continue to return capital to shareholders through our dividend. As previously announced, we anticipate dividend payments of $325 million in fiscal '24, reflecting a 17% increase to our dividend per share to $0.35 for an annual rate of $1.40. Importantly, we believe the strong cash flow profile of the combined company provides us with further opportunity for investment and capital return. To this end, following the achievement of our leverage target, over time, we expect to increase our dividend with the goal of achieving our stated target payout ratio of 35% to 40% and see the opportunity to resume share repurchases in the future. In closing, we delivered strong fiscal '23 results, highlighted by revenue gains at constant currency significant gross margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth despite a rapidly shifting backdrop. This marked record EPS for the company, underscoring our agility and the consistent execution of the global teams. We remain focused on staying disciplined to deliver against our long-term priorities to drive sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder returns. I'd now like to open it up for your questions. See also Bill Gates Stock Portfolio: August 2023 Update and Michael Burry is Shorting the Market (Again) and Selling These 10 Stocks.Story continuesQ&amp;A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim Securities. Robert Drbul: Good morning. I was just wondering -- congrats on a good quarter. Can you talk a little more around what you really learned from Coach's success over the years and how can you apply that to all the brands, I think, particularly as you expand the portfolio with this planned acquisition? Thanks. Joanne Crevoiserat: Thanks, Bob, and good morning. We are closing out the year with record earnings per share, and we're operating from a position of strength. And I think what our results show is the power of our brand and the power of our business model. And we do see this acquisition is compelling. And we do also have a lot of learnings that we can apply from Coach's success over the last few years. And there are three or four things, I think, that come top of mind as I think about your question. First, and probably most importantly, we've clarified our brand positioning. We've done that across our portfolio and really clarifying the unique position within the market for each of our brands. And as we've done that, we've crystallized our target customer and really getting to know these customers on a deeper level, fielding a lot of research, ethnographic research, quantitative, qualitative that and those insights have driven the acquisition of new and younger customers. We talked about it in our prepared remarks, half of our acquisitions in the last year being new and younger customers (ph) -- of our new customers were young Millennial and Gen Z consumers. I think second, we strengthened our teams and ways of working and I talk about this, but it's about applying data and analytics, and consumer insights in the business. Putting it in the hands of decision makers so that it influences action and that's how we deliver results behind those capabilities. And third, they're all important, but maybe most importantly, we're investing in brand building activities. That includes doubling our marketing spend over the last few years and the capabilities to meet the consumer where they are. We have a strong direct-to-consumer platform. We continue to invest in that. And we have -- it starts with a productive and profitable store fleet and we don't talk a lot about this, but our store fleet today is more profitable than it was pre-pandemic. In addition, we've created capabilities to meet consumers in digital and social channels that is increasingly important and we've tripled our digital business versus pre-pandemic levels. And we supported all of this with disciplined operating principles and disciplined inventory management. So -- that's what's driving our business. It's working and our progress is reflected. You can see that increases in AUR, increases in gross margin that we're seeing across our brand and they've enabled us to consistently deliver strong results in the face of a volatile environment. Coach is a great example I'm going to steal a little thunder from Todd, is a great example of the power of these strategies. In fiscal '24, Coach is tracking to achieve its highest annual sales and earnings in its history and we see tremendous runway ahead for that brand. So overall, we’re excited about the opportunities we see in our current portfolio and with the potential of this acquisition. Robert Drbul: Thank you. Operator: Your next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America. Your line is open. Lorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good morning. Can you help us diagnose the North America sales weakness in the quarter and what drove the shortfall versus plan. Was it more pronounced in outlet versus full price? Was it a product category? And then after that, can you just talk a little bit about what caused the improvement quarter-to-date? Thank you. Joanne Crevoiserat: Perfect. I would cover the both of those together, Lorraine. Thank you for the question. North America, the environment is challenging. The aspirational consumer, it's -- particularly, the lower income cohort is under pressure on a relative basis and being more choiceful. We see that in our conversion results. Importantly, though, we entered the quarter with our eyes open on some of the challenges in North America with an intention on continuing to drive our business in a healthy way. And you can see that we continue to grow AUR and expanded gross margin and we were disciplined as we managed through it. And what we're seeing with this more considered purchase in North America is that innovation is what's driving engagement.And we know that, that bar is high for the consumer. In terms of your question, in terms of what's changing it, we're focused on brand building, delivering product excellence and great execution, including with strong inventory management. And what's changed the trend and it's changed pretty dramatically in the first quarter, we see an improvement. I think, number one, we're up against easier compares from a year ago, but we've also accelerated newness. As we -- being a direct-to-consumer model, we see the trends happening and we understand what consumers are responding to. And we've leveraged our agile supply chain to pull forward newness and that's had a big impact on our results. As we've talked about in the first quarter, quarter-to-date, our business running roughly in line with last year. So we've seen a nice turnaround there. And we're continuing to focus on driving a healthy business staying close to our consumer and delivering that great product that the consumer continues to respond to. Scott Roe: And Lorraine, this is Scott. Maybe just to build on how that translates into the numbers too. We've given guidance for North America to be up slightly through the year, but really that trend that Joanne just mentioned that we're seeing right now is what's reflected in the first quarter, again -- against an easier comp, it distorts the year-on-year percentages a little bit. When we look at the balance of the year, it is very balanced, right? First half, second half and we've taken that trend on a go-forward basis in our assumptions. It's not heroic. It really reflects what we see on the ground right now and the trends that we see. Lorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Operator: Your next question is from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Matthew Boss: Great. Thanks. So Joanne, with the improvement in North America, how would you assess the overall health of the handbag and accessories category globally today or maybe how best to break down your 3% to 4% revenue guidance between AUR and units? And then, Scott, excluding the pause in share buyback associated with the transaction, I guess, has anything changed with your underlying plan for $5 earnings in FY '25? And can you speak to the free cash flow profile post integration and just the opportunity that this provides multiyear? Joanne Crevoiserat: So thanks, Matt. I'll pick up the first part of that question in terms of the handbag category. This is an incredibly resilient and durable category. And we're seeing it, again, as we go through incredibly choppy demand environment around the world, the consumer continues to engage with this category in a very strong way. And it has a -- the category has proven to be durable through downturns, resilient and coming out of downturns. And the challenges that we faced over the last three years have really helped us to navigate different headwinds in different regions of the world. So as I look at our business, and the consumer response to the category, we're seeing really strong growth in our international businesses, even while the business in North America may be relatively challenged. And as we look forward, our outlook is for growth in every region in fiscal '24, slight growth in North America, but a continuation of the strong trends we see in international markets and our business is positioned to take advantage of those trends, both regionally and by channel, wherever the customer chooses to shop, we're in a great position to take advantage of those trends. And these are trends we're seeing today when a lot of the tourism business that maybe we have relied on in the past has been a bigger part of the business. We're driving this business with more local consumers and we expect over time that tourism to rebound and that will be an added benefit to our business. So a strong and durable category and we're well positioned to capitalize on that going forward. Scott Roe: And that's the perfect build, Matt, on your question around how we see the $5. The business has momentum, we're coming from a position of strength and there's no change in the fundamental outlook that led us to talk about our confidence in hitting the $5. As you rightly pointed out, the pause in share repurchase does impact EPS, but not operating earnings in terms of those assumptions, right? So if you think about that impact, there's two factors. We don't buy back as many shares. So the average share count is obviously going to be higher than previously assumed. On the other hand, we're accumulating cash, right? And that cash will be available at closing to help pay down debt. In the meantime, it's going to earn interest. So the net of those two things on a cumulative basis are about $0.35 and we've previously already said, I think, in the press release, that's about $0.10 in fiscal '24. And then you asked about free cash flow, that's the exciting part sitting as a CFO here. When I look at the potential of this transaction, first of all, just a couple of data points that maybe ground everybody, there's about $1 billion in cumulatively, if you just add up the two companies today and the generation of cash flow, right now at this point is in excess of $1.5 billion per year, right? And we've said that when you consider synergies and growth over time, that number exceeds $2 billion on an annual basis. So $2 billion of free cash flow focused really acutely in the short term on paying down debt.And then over time, the optionality that, that gives us from a capital allocation is, I think, a difference making as you think about this as a combined company in the future. Operator: Your next question is from Brook Roach of Goldman Sachs. Brooke Roach: Good morning. Thank you very much for taking our question. I was hoping you could talk a bit more about the drivers of the positive handbag AUR that you saw in the quarter and your outlook for additional ticket and AUR increases as you move into FY '25? How are you planning for AUR growth, in particular, pricing growth in North America against what we perceive to be a slightly more promotional competitive industry backdrop? Thank you. Joanne Crevoiserat: Well, I'll kick it off and then toss it to Todd to give you some real color on how that's happening at Coach and continuing to happen year after year. We are driving handbag AUR growth, not only in Coach, Kate Spade delivering over two years of AUR growth as well. And it comes from really understanding our consumer, leveraging data across our value chain, all of the capabilities that we've built over the last few years and embedded in our decision-making in terms of our assortment size, our assortment architecture, cutting off the tail, our inventory management capabilities. All of those capabilities, our teams have embraced. Ways of working here are critically important to make sure that those capabilities end up in the hands of decision-makers and they drive action. And I'd be remiss if I did talk about the fact that when we get to know our customers better, that gives our creative teams an opportunity to deliver that incredible creativity in a powerful way that resonates with our target consumers. So it's that balance of magic and logic. And with that, I will pass it to Todd, and he can give you some examples of how that comes to life at Coach. Todd Kahn: Thank you, Joanne. And I said this before, innovation creates desire. And we have created a desire not just in the product, but the way we present the product. Joanne has talked a lot about how we use our Tapestry platform to inform our understanding of our customer. And we do this with coupled with the idea of expressive luxury. So when we look at expressive luxury, we talk about the actual product. We talk about the place, what's the environment we put it in. If you saw this year, we created so much innovation with the Tabby pop-ups globally, that created excitement. And so I'm very confident that the storytelling that we've really led with this purpose-led storytelling. We started last year with Lil Nas. We moved into connecting the product and the storytelling together with our Tabby campaign, which has drove incredible desire for Tabby. So I feel very good about our continuing AUR both in North America and globally. We'll see low to mid-single digits there. And we're doing it on both sides of the equation. We've raised the floor over the last couple of years, our consumers are coming into the brand at higher price points. We're extraordinarily focused on that 300 to 500 price range. And that has created even greater white space between us and European luxury. So for us, the desire of our product, the innovation we're bringing, the storytelling around it, all under the umbrella of express of luxury is working and I believe will continue to work. Brooke Roach: Thank you very much. I’ll pass it on. Todd Kahn: Thank you. Operator: Your next question is from Mark Altschwager of Baird. Mark Altschwager: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just first, with respect to Kate Spade, I think you said you saw more pressure in the value channel. Was AUR up at Kate adjusted for what may have been a mix shift to retail from outlet? And then with respect to the acceleration in product launches early in Q1 here. What's your level of confidence that the acceleration in the revenue trend can be sustained? It sounds like there may be a bit of pull forward here to the extent you pushed up product releases? And then separately for Scott, just with freight, how much break recapture opportunity is left at this stage? Just if you could quantify that for us, it would be helpful. Thank you. Joanne Crevoiserat: Yes. Thanks for your question, Mark. We did drive handbag AUR increases at Kate (ph) in North America. So it was not mix benefited and it's based on deliberate strategies. We are not chasing every last dollar of top line in our business. We're protecting brand health and we see a lot of runway ahead at Kate, both top line growth and in margin and AUR growth. They're a little bit earlier on the journey, although now we've got two years of consistent AUR increases under our belt. So we feel good about our ability to continue to drive AUR increases based on brand positioning. And that's the result of -- our disciplined operations are leveraging our platform with data and analytics and applying that to the business, but also driving innovation.And we're incredibly focused at Kate Spade at driving innovation and -- the big change that we saw was delivery -- faster delivery of that newness and innovation, particularly in the outlet channel with the Madison delivery, and that's not a one-off. This is a focus of ours as we get to know our core customer. We continue to innovate on product and experiences with the brand and those launches are working. We have more in store for fiscal '24. We talked about the launches of our Dakota bag coming this fall and other changes that we're making in the business that are having an impact. So we feel we're clear eyed about the opportunity at Kate. We are accelerating the pace of innovation to accelerate our progress, and we feel good about the product that we have in the pipeline to continue to drive that trend as we move forward. Scott Roe: Yes. And so, as you think about the pace of the year or two, just maybe a little more on that. So first of all, we'll see a significant sequential improvement in Kate in the first quarter. I don't know, if we said that already. But just like we do in the overall business. So while that's certainly positive news, and we -- and Joanne already said, we're tracking quarter-to-date, very much in line with that. Also remember, the comps get a little squirrely between the quarters here. And when we look at a multiyear stack in Q1 and really the balance of the year in our guided outlook. It's a fairly consistent theme with international being relatively stronger in the first half. Again, comps being a lot of the driver of this and then a little more in North America in the back half. But when you zoom out a couple of clicks and just look at the trajectory, this is very much the current pace of business being projected in our outlook going forward. And again, I would just repeat, it's not heroic in the way we've done it, and it's very balanced. It's not back half loaded. It's very consistent in terms of the way we guided. You had a specific question on freight. We didn't identify it. I would tell you, freight is largely behind us now. The one quarter where we're going to see a benefit is Q1. And if you recall, from years past, that's when we started seeing the big freight and then we had one quarter where we were still down last year in gross margin because of freight. So we’ll get that benefit on a year-on-year basis in Q1. But for the balance of the year, it’s a much more moderate benefit as we look forward. So less than a full point as we look at this year. Mark Altschwager: Thank you. Operator: Your next question is from Dana Telsey of Telsey Group. Dana Telsey: Hi. As you think about this upcoming year in this upcoming fiscal year and improvement in China that you've seen, how are you planning for Asia and China? And how are you thinking about Europe go forward? And in particular, on the channel distribution, any unpacking of what you're seeing in wholesale and how that's differing from the retail performance? Thank you. Joanne Crevoiserat: Yeah. So let me start with China. Our categories and our brands are resonating with Chinese consumers. We drove 50% growth at constant currency in the market in the last quarter. And I know that the last year number was COVID disrupted, but that was an increase to our prior peak at constant currency. So we're seeing a consistently strong business in China the consumer continuing to value what we represent in the market. And our teams in China are doing an excellent job building our brands and connecting with consumers. As you know, we've been in that market for two decades, building brands, understanding the landscape and we've been agile to be able to pivot with the consumer and deliver in a way that they continue to respond to. As we look forward, we see an opportunity for continued performance in China. We talked about our guide high-single digit growth for this year. And just to frame it, it continues to expect that growth to our prior peak. So we do expect gradual recovery in China continuing throughout the year and as Scott mentioned, it's based on what we're seeing and the trends we see in the market today. So we expect a continuation. To your point, we're seeing tremendous opportunity as well in other Asia. And that's a part Japan and the rest of Asia is a part of the market that is now almost equal to China in terms of size, and it is also growing fast. We expect high-single digit growth in that region as well as in Europe. And in those markets, we're increasingly engaging the local domestic consumer base. And that's what's been driving, if you can think about it over the last three years, that's what's been driving our business. We also expect that there'll be some benefit of tourism as tourism recovers. We're seeing some of that today, mostly in Asia, a little bit in Europe, but not as much in the West at this point. We're not counting on that in our outlook. Again, we're taking the trends that we're seeing in the business and we're projecting those forward and we think a prudent way. But our international business is strong and our teams on the ground are engaging consumers in effective ways and the consumer is responding to the product and experiences which we're delivering.Todd Kahn: And Dana, I'll just add on the wholesale, if you take Europe, we're really growing our wholesale business in Europe in a very productive way. I feel very good about that. And that benefits from a local consumer as Joanne said, but as we see China opening up more, there will be more -- if there is an inbound of PRC in the rest of Asia and in Europe, that will benefit us. And then in North America, again, Coach is 96% direct-to-consumer. So we have a much greater connectivity to our client in that area. That said, we always believe in the wholesale channel. We want to win in that channel. We'd love to see many of our wholesale partners create higher service levels in those channels that will enable us to do that and we're working with them on that. So overall, we feel good about our positioning. We feel good about controlling our own destiny, but there is tremendous opportunity. And I will say not just in handbags, but for the Coach brand, we see further opportunities with footwear, particularly in wholesale. Dana Telsey: Thank you. Scott Roe: And let me jump in here -- sorry, Dana. I'm just going to jump in. I was looking through my notes, and I don't think we fully answered one of the questions that Mark laid out. And I just wanted to get it out there for the group. It was specific on what we saw in AUR at Kate Spade. And we grew AUR across both retail and outlet in the fourth quarter in Kate Spade. So that focus on quality and while we’re not chasing the last dollar focus on fundamental and long-term brand health, that was evident in the quarter that we just reported. So I just wanted to get that out there. Dana Telsey: Thank you. Operator: Your next question is from Oliver Chen of TD Cowen. Oliver Chen: Hi. Thanks a lot. As we look forward to holiday, what are your thoughts in terms of the inventory as well as planning around gifting and also you’ve been on a great journey to make the inventory breadth more efficient. And a follow-up question, would love you to talk to us a little bit about the approval process or major hurdles or catalysts ahead. And also, how you thought about the differences and the opportunity of the Michael Kors brand given that you have so much research -- consumer research there. We're looking at cross-product elasticity and diversion ratios, just to understand the relationships between the two brands and the big opportunity, financial and strategic? Thank you very much. Joanne Crevoiserat: Well, maybe I'll pass it to Todd first to talk about how we're excited about holiday. We are in a great position to your point on inventory. Our inventory is down 8% versus last year, actually a better position than we were expecting coming out of the year. So that puts us in -- it gives us a great opportunity to ensure we have the right product at the right time for consumers. Todd, do you want to put a little color on that? Todd Kahn: Yeah. Hi, Oliver. And I kind of was hoping you were going to ask me a Coachtopia question, but we feel very good about holiday. You're going to see clarity of products, building on our really significant platforms with Tabby. We're going to be launching starting in the fall, which will lead into holiday, and I won't give too much away on the holiday campaign. But our Shine campaign, which again is a further extension of connecting product with purpose (ph). We feel very, very good about that. We feel like we done a good job, but there's always room to improve on the animation of both the product and how we look at holiday. So I'm very excited for the holiday quarter. I think both in brick-and-mortar offerings as well as our digital offerings. And I will say, even though you didn't ask me, we are very excited about where we are with Coachtopia and as Joanne said, while still relatively small at the year ahead of where we thought we would be, more importantly, I'll quote Scott here. It's hitting above its weight class in terms of being a driver of younger consumers creating interest in the brand. So you'll see Coachtopia play really a significant factor as we start expanding the product offering and start putting it in more doors right around that holiday gift-giving period. So we'll have something for everyone at Coach and I know the same is true at our sister brand.Joanne Crevoiserat: Thanks, Todd. That is true. And I'll hit on the regulatory questions and the Michael Kors question briefly because I know we're running over time. But just in short, we're confident in our ability to complete this transaction. This is a transaction. It is highly complementary. It expands our portfolio reach and diversification. And to your point, Oliver, we fielded a lot of research coming into this transaction. We know that the portfolio at Capri includes -- and including Michael Kors, they're strong brands and they're well positioned in attractive markets and market segments. We’re excited about the opportunity that we see working together putting these brands on our platform. They’re distinctive and have unique positioning in the market, which is why they are so attractive to us. And that does include the Kors brand, putting that – all of the brands on our platform allows us to take these iconic brands with heritage put them on our consumer engagement platform to drive more innovation, more connectivity and really more relevance for the consumer which will benefit all of our stakeholders around the world. So we’re excited about the opportunities ahead. Operator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&amp;A. I will now turn it over to Joanne for some concluding remarks. Joanne Crevoiserat: Well, thank you for joining us today and for your interest in our story and thank you to our exceptional teams around the world. We're pleased to report record earnings per share in fiscal '23 and to share our expectations for the continued top and bottom line growth we see for fiscal '24. We're in a position of strength and we're laser-focused on our current business where we have significant runway. Building on this foundation last week, we were excited to announce the planned acquisition of Capri Holdings. We have strong conviction that this combination positions us for an even brighter future, accelerating our strategic agenda and driving enhanced cash flow and financial returns. We see a compelling opportunity to deliver superior value for all stakeholders and I look forward to engaging with you in the days ahead. Thanks, and have a great day. Operator: This concludes Tapestry's earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation.]"

In 2023, the world’s most precious commodity is an envelope-sized computer chip.The H100, a rectangular black maze of circuits with a shimmering microchip at its centre, is a niche piece of equipment even by Silicon Valley’s nerdy standards.Its $40,000 price tag is exceptional for a computer processor, although even if you have the cash, good luck getting your hands on one. The half a million H100s expected to be made this year are already sold out.Not that one chip would do you much good. Last week, it emerged that Saudi Arabia had ordered some 3,000 H100s.Almost all of the chips are being snapped up by the richest companies in the world: Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta are believed to account for the vast majority of demand.Joe Biden has banned their export to China, under rules designed to prevent sensitive technology ending up in enemy hands.While more than a trillion microchips – the brains of our electronics – are made each year, the H100 is at the centre of a global race for intelligence.The chip is described by its maker, the Silicon Valley giant Nvidia, as the world’s first designed for “generative” artificial intelligence, the type of powerful, “creative” AI behind technologies such as ChatGPT that has taken the world by storm.This year, the rise of systems like ChatGPT have rekindled warnings that artificial intelligence should be treated with the same seriousness as nuclear weapons and climate change.Its makers have been summoned to Downing Street and the White House and threatened with new regulations.The strikes that have ground Hollywood to a halt, for example, are driven partly because actors and writers fear being replaced by AI replicas that do not demand wages.How the chip worksType a query into ChatGPT and it will confidently spit out an erudite answer in a split second. The heavy lifting, though, is being done by thousands of Nvidia chips in an enormous humming server farm hundreds of miles away.Story continuesThe AI boom has catapulted the Californian company into one of an elite group of businesses worth more than one trillion dollars and made its founder, Jensen Huang, the world’s 32nd-richest person – with a $39bn fortune.Despite the emergence of rivals, Jensen Huang’s Nvidia dominates to the point that it’s frequently seen as ‘the only game in town’ - I-Hwa Cheng/BloombergThe H100’s position as the key to the AI boom is really a happy accident. For most of its 30 years, Nvidia has produced chips, known as GPUs, used to power 3D graphics in video games.Traditional computer processors, known as CPUs, can perform complicated calculations, but generally only one at a time. In contrast GPUs can carry out hundreds of simple calculations at once.That made them adept at tasks like modifying colourful pixels in a video game. What the company did not count on was that its chips would also be perfect for the rapid data processing required for artificial intelligence.In 2012, Google researchers used 16,000 CPUs to train rudimentary AI software that could recognise pictures of cats. A year later, researchers achieved the same results with four GPUs.“It’s partially incredible foresight, and partially just blind luck,” says Jay Goldberg, a Silicon Valley chip industry expert.“The way that AI works is it’s the same maths equation, just done over and over and over again in vast quantities. And GPUs are really good at that.”Luck notwithstanding, people are now buying the chips as fast as Nvidia can make them. “GPUs at this point are considerably harder to get than drugs,” Elon Musk told a conference in May.While rival companies make GPUs, one technology investor describes Nvidia as “the only game in town”. And for those that want the best, only the H100 will do.The state of the art model that powers ChatGPT, for example, was developed using an estimated 25,000 A100s, the chip’s predecessor.The new version is an order of magnitude more powerful: accomplishing in 20 hours what would take the A100 a week.For all their ascribed “intelligence”, the best AI systems are really a product of the best training, and that is really a matter of having the best computer.The first version of the model behind ChatGPT had around 100 million variables known as parameters; the latest is believed to have trillions.No surprise, then, that tracking down the best chips has become an act of desperation. “There’s one thing that can provide competition to H100 GPUs: Taylor Swift concert tickets,” Aravind Srinivas, an AI entrepreneur, tweeted.One online commentator refers to it as the “Opec of GPUs”.Silicon Valley bosses trade stories of their efforts to obtain the fabled chips: some tap up their well connected venture capital investors for contacts, others beg friends at universities for a chance to plug in to their research labs.There is only one guaranteed way to obtain a steady supply, however: hundreds of millions of dollars. That means there are now broadly two camps of customers that can buy chips in the quantities that matter: tech giants, and nation states.The global race for AI supremacyWithin a few years, AI has moved from a promising technology to a critical national priority.In 2017, China outlined a “new generation AI plan” vowing to make the country the “primary” centre for innovation by 2030. According to the US-based Center for Security and Emerging Technology, Beijing is seeking to push towards “artificial general intelligence”, a system capable of matching human intelligence.The plan has been met with a volley of US sanctions designed to cripple Chinese efforts in AI.Last year the White House barred Nvidia from selling its H100 and A100 chips to China without a licence. The company has rushed out new versions of the chips to evade the controls, and the Biden administration is now expected to respond with a new set of rules.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are both investing heavily in chips, developing their own “large language models” similar to ChatGPT.According to the Financial Times, the Saudi software, being developed at the oil-rich state’s Kaust research institution, is largely being created by Chinese researchers whose education bars them from working in America.In the US, the Biden administration is spending tens of billions to encourage microchip companies to set up factories in America, a plan that has been described as “one of the biggest government interventions since the Second World War”.Nvidia may be an American company, but its highest-powered chips are exclusively made in Taiwan, making the entire AI industry dangerously exposed to the threat of Chinese invasion.AI weapons are an obvious example of just how important the new tech is. Autonomous drones that can see the world around them and respond accordingly have already changed the battlefield in Ukraine, and AI has successfully flown F-16 fighter jets.But the risks are wider: generative AI programmes similar to ChatGPT threaten mass-scale cyber attacks and the industrialisation of fake images.Mike Wooldridge, of the Alan Turing Institute, says widespread disinformation is the greatest immediate risk from AI.In 2016, Russia was accused of meddling in Donald Trump’s election using armies of internet trolls in Moscow offices. By next year’s election, AI is likely to be capable of spinning up infinite numbers of divisive online comments and hoax pictures that are indistinguishable from the real thing.Old fashioned economic conflict is also a concern, however.Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has predicted that once AI software gets to a level of sophistication where it can improve itself, it will kick off a “recursive loop of innovation” that will see it create “phenomenal wealth”, not to mention instant scientific breakthroughs.Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, predicts that bots will reach a point of critical mass after which it will teach itself - JOEL SAGET/AFPNot everyone is as optimistic, but if even the less radical predictions about how AI will change economies come true, countries will not want to be left behind.Britain left behindAs for Britain? Five years ago, the British technology investor Ian Hogarth predicted that the rise of machine learning systems would lead to what he called “AI nationalism”.Hogarth suggested that the rise of AI would mean an “accelerated arms race” that would lead to more closed economies, prevention of foreign takeovers and restrictions on talent leaving, adding that “AI policy will become the single most important area of government policy.”He warned that Britain was getting its own AI strategy wrong by allowing the sale of companies such as London-based Deepmind, one of the world’s top AI labs, which Google bought for a comparatively paltry £400m in 2014.If his ideas seemed outlandish five years ago, they are now being taken seriously. This year, Hogarth was appointed the chairman of Rishi Sunak’s AI Foundation Taskforce, designed to encourage cutting edge safety research.The UK may have founded one of the world’s top AI companies, and a government review last year described the field as a “top-level economic, security, health and wellbeing priority”.But when it comes to the computing power needed for today’s technology, experts warn that we are dangerously behind. A review into the UK’s computing capabilities published this year pointed out that there were fewer than 1,000 top-spec Nvidia GPUs available to researchers in the UK – a fraction of what it took to train the latest ChatGPT model.Archer-2, Britain’s most powerful computer, was designed four years ago, and did not anticipate the AI boom.“The UK is not well set up at the moment for large scale GPU-focused computing,” says Mark Parsons, the executive director at the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre, the UK’s leading supercomputer hub, where Archer-2 is based. “We just don’t have that capability anywhere.”One industry source warns that within a few years, “there will be a compute crunch in the economy that is as damaging as the energy crunch has been over the last year.”.The Government has set aside £900m for a new supercomputer and research infrastructure, although these are unlikely to come online for at least a year, a lifetime in AI terms.Instead Rishi Sunak is focusing on other areas, such as putting the UK at the centre of global efforts to rein in the risk of runaway AI breaking free of human control.One of the options likely to be discussed at a global safety summit in November is a UK-based global agency modelled on the International Atomic Energy Agency, the body set up in the early Cold War to prevent nuclear winter.Preparations for the summit are behind schedule but proceeding rapidly, with officials debating at what level China will be invited.The new superpowersThis all may be a sideshow, however. For unlike nuclear weapons, it is not nation states at the forefront of AI development, but a handful of giant technology companies.This year, Google will spend $33bn on buildings and equipment, with spending on infrastructure such as Nvidia chips rising by around a third.Netflix – satirised in an episode of Black Mirror that imagined a future where actors were replaced by AI holograms – is advertising machine learning jobs that pay up to $900,000, more than four times the prime minister’s salary.If AI power is a product of the computing strength behind it, national governments pale compared to the resources available to private enterprises.Inflection AI, a start-up run by DeepMind’s co-founder Mustafa Suleyman and funded by Microsoft, is building an AI supercomputer with 22,000 H100 chips.Amazon, Microsoft and Google, the so-called “hyperscalers” that run the data centres an increasing proportion of the world’s IT runs on, are lining up orders for tens of thousands each.Meta may require 100,000, according to one analysis.Goldberg says that the “super seven” giant IT companies – adding in the three Chinese companies of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent – are responsible for approaching 100pc of demand for Nvidia’s top chips.Altman, perhaps the most prominent figure in AI today, talks about OpenAI in the same language one would typically reserve for nation states. He says that in future its leader could be democratically elected.For now, though they are answerable to shareholders and employees, which has led to questions about whose side these companies are really on.In 2019, employees at Microsoft opposed the company’s work with the US military, writing that “we did not sign up to develop weapons”.The prior year, protests at Google forced the company to halt work on a drone contract for the Pentagon.Palantir chief Alex Karp has warned that delays due to moral qualms in the an AI arms race will not impede rivals like China - Eddie MulhollandAlex Karp, the chief executive of Palantir, an AI company used by the CIA to help track down Osama bin Laden, recently warned that such indecision would be comparable to Robert Oppenheimer refusing to build the atomic bomb, and that no such quandary exists in China.“Our hesitation, perceived or otherwise, to move forward with military applications of artificial intelligence will be punished,” he said.Time may be running out for this to be decided.Demis Hassabis, the founder of DeepMind and Britain’s most prominent AI figurehead, says artificial general intelligence, the point at which AI development reaches a potentially unstoppable velocity, could happen within a decade.As for the company powering this revolution, this month Nvidia unveiled a yet more powerful version “GH200”. The world is scrambling for the superchip at the heart of the AI race, but it may soon be yesterday’s news.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

196,104d68d9-6694-37da-8cf0-afe53784ca66,NVDA,2023-08-19,Why Are Stocks Moving Lower?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-stocks-moving-lower-231000799.html,1692400200,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'NVDA', 'AMZN']","[Are stocks finally coming out of the irrational exuberance they were suffering from this year, or is the pullback in the market only a temporary and passing phase that primarily reflects the absence of any meaningful near-term catalysts that can help sustain its earlier momentum?I find myself in the latter camp, with the better-than-expected June-quarter earnings reporting cycle now effectively behind us - more on that a little later in this note – and the steady flow of positive economic readings pushing the ‘recession-is-coming’ crowd into retreat.The recent uptrend in treasury yields is a legitimate point of concern. But I see it as more reflective of renewed economic resilience than a reassessment of what the Fed will or will not do going forward.Even if the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker of +5.8% growth estimate for the current period proves to be too optimistic, and the actual growth pace proves to be around half that level where the consensus is, it is still magnitudes better than what anyone would have expected six, nine, or twelve months back. The U.S. economy’s performance has been nothing less than spectacular, particularly given how much the central bank has tightened monetary policy in this cycle.Higher interest rates and mortgage rates are undoubtedly a headwind for the market. Still, many stocks will thrive even in a high-rate environment if the driver for higher rates is economic growth and positive momentum.We will see what the Fed chief says at Jackson Hole, but the market doesn’t seem to have an issue with another rate hike. The way I see it, the big point of uncertainty at present is the duration of ‘higher-for-longer,’ meaning a tentative timeline for when the Fed will start cutting rates. Perhaps Jackson Hole will help provide some clarity on that question.On the earnings front, we provide the scorecard and other details below, but this earnings season has been another example of the continued resilience and stability of the U.S. consumer. We heard this from the banks, the leisure and hospitality players, and consumer-facing digital and traditional operators.Story continuesThere is undoubtedly stress at the lower end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. However, one is at a loss to see that in current estimates of GDP growth.Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. Other issues, like the resumption of student loan payments, are seen as weighing on spending trends. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.It is hard to envision any meaningful consumer spending slowdown without a labor market crackup.Q2 Earnings Scorecard (As of Friday, August 18th)The Q2 reporting cycle is effectively over now, with results from 473 S&amp;P 500 members, or 94.5% of the index’s total membership, already out.We have over 100 companies reporting results this week, including 12 S&amp;P 500 members. Ulta Beauty ULTA and Lowe’s LOW are among this week’s notable companies reporting results this week. Still, the most consequential company on deck to report results is Nvidia NVDA, which will report after the market’s close on Wednesday, August 23rd.Nvidia’s last earnings release on May 24th was one for the record books, with the magnitude of the guidance upgrade unlike any we have seen in the past. The stock is up +41.1% since the May 24th release, which compares to the Tech sector’s +5.2% gain and the S&amp;P 500 index’s +5.6% rise in the same time period. The stock has effectively become a play on the AI trend.Nvidia shares are down -7.4% this month, roughly in-line with the Tech sector’s -7.3% decline but lagging behind the market’s -4.6% decline. This recent underperformance notwithstanding, the stock is up +196.2% this year, massively outperforming the Zacks Tech sector (up +32.7%) and the S&amp;P 500 index (up +15.2%).Estimates for the quarter doubled following the aforementioned guidance, with the current $2.06 per share estimate up $1.04 per share three months ago. Estimates for Q4 and full-year 2024 similarly went up sharply.Given its performance since the last quarterly release, the stock is under a spotlight as it comes out with July-quarter numbers and discusses trends about the coming periods. The market is trying to handicap whether the May 2023 report was a one-off or the start of a new trend.That’s a lot of pressure to handle, but Nvidia has a history of thriving under such conditions.Returning to the 473 S&amp;P 500 members that have reported already, total Q2 earnings for these companies are down -8.5% from last year on +0.91% higher revenues, with 79.5% beating EPS estimates and 65.8% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts nevertheless put the Q2 results from these 473 index members with what we had seen from the same group of companies in other recent periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe comparison charts below put the Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates for these 473 index members in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith respect to the Retail sector 2023 Q2 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 25 of the 33 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index.Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard &amp; Poor’s standard industry classification. The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon AMZN and restaurant players.Total Q2 earnings for these 25 retailers that have reported are up +28.9% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 80% beating EPS estimates and 56% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the Q2 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 25 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q2 earnings were up +526% on +10.8% higher revenues, as it beat top and bottom-line expectations.As we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.The two comparison charts below show the Q2 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Earnings Big Picture The chart below shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for the S&amp;P 500 index for 2023 Q2, the following three quarters, and actual results for the preceding four quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlease note that the -7.7% decline for Q2 earnings on +0.9% higher revenues is the blended growth picture for the quarter, which combines the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies.As you can see in this chart, Q2 is on track to be the third consecutive quarter of earnings declines and the first quarter of declining revenues. As noted earlier, a big part of the earnings and revenue weakness is due to the Energy sector.Excluding the Energy sector drag, Q2 earnings would be down -1.6% on +4.7% higher revenues.The chart below shows the year-over-year change in net income margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, 2023 Q2 will be the 6th quarter in a row of declining margins for the S&amp;P 500 index.Margins in Q2 are expected to be below the year-earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest margin pressure expected to be in the Energy, Medical, Basic Materials, and Construction sectors.With the earnings focus lately on the Tech sector, it is instructive to see how much distance has been covered on the margins front in this key sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Q2 Earnings Confirm Improving Growth Trends Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares of drug distributors like McKesson (MCK), AmerisourceBergen (ABC), and Cardinal Health (CAH) each fell more than 2%.But analysts say the reality of the announcement is less severe than the market's initial reaction suggested.""Thursday was a unique 'perfect storm' of news that likely had a bigger impact on sentiment than it will in setting precedent,"" wrote UBS analyst Kevin Caliendo in a note, adding the selloff Thursday was ""nonsensical.""The Blues insurer, which is responsible for about 5 million members in California and posts $24 billion in annual revenue, is unbundling its PBM service and doling out portions to disruptors like Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs and Amazon Pharmacy (AMZN).The move, according to Blue Shield, will save $500 million on medications annually— a number CEO Paul Markovich told Yahoo Finance he is confident will be achieved.""We're creating a different mouse trap here. We've done the math,"" Markovich said.Under the new arrangement, Cost Plus Drugs will be responsible for generics and Amazon will take on the mail order business. Puerto Rico-based Abarca Health will manage claims and Prime Therapeutics, a PBM jointly owned by 19 Blues plans which works with partners like Walgreens (WBA) and Cigna's Express Scripts, will handle drug pricing negotiations.The shift will take effect starting in 2024 when Blue Shield's contract with CVS, which has been in place since 2021, ends.However, CVS will maintain the most profitable segment: specialty pharmacy. That, according to analysts, is the reason the announcement isn't all doom and gloom for the Big 3 PBMs — CVS, Cigna, and United Health Group.Story continues""[The] spectre of AMZN will likely negatively impact sentiment for the group, again,"" JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill wrote in a note on Thursday. ""However, we think the announcement actually highlights the value of legacy PBMs and limitations of newer models as Blue Shield is keeping the fastest growing and largest portion of its drug spend with CVS.""Gill noted that generics typically represent only 15% of drug spend even though they represent a higher volume of spend, and specialty drugs continue to rise in cost and represent a pain point for large employers, as seen during the recent demand surge for branded weight loss drugs like Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy and Ozempic, and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Mounjaro.""Per Cost Plus's page, the company has over 1,000 generic medications available but almost no branded drugs. Although the company seeks to add more branded drugs, it appears to be focusing only on specialty drugs that can be delivered via mail order,"" Gill said.In addition, mail order prescriptions have not taken over in-person pickups, despite a surge seen during the pandemic, so there is little concern about Amazon's share of the new arrangement, analysts said.Some are concerned about the customer experience with the complex makeup of PBMs.""Coordinating five vendors is like an average Tuesday for us,"" Markovich said.He added that despite the criticism, Blue Shield is going to be sticking to the unbundled model long-term, even though it is likely the combination of players changes in the future.A sign marks a CVS branch on May 16 in Pasadena, Calif. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)'Hard to replicate'The announcement from California Blue Shield on Thursday also isn't the first time an insurer has tried such a move.""Health plans have a mixed track record of separating or in-sourcing PBM functions,"" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note Friday. ""This decision by a large health plan will keep scrutiny on PBM economics and attention on proposed legislative changes, though we see the stock reactions as disproportionate relative to the likely implications.""""Historically, the value of scale offered by the Big 3 PBMs has been difficult to replicate,"" the firm added.Craig Garthwaite, a health economist and director of the Program on Healthcare at the Kellogg School at Northwestern University, told Yahoo Finance he's willing to bet the savings California Blue Shield ends up seeing isn't actually $500 million.""There's got to be a belief (by Blue Shield) that there's $500 million per year in excessive, unwarranted profit that the PBM is taking. I just don't believe that's true,"" Garthwaite said.The fact that CVS has been able to keep the profitable specialty pharmacy business also bolsters the unpopular opinion that the Big 3 serve a purpose. Garthwaite said this move runs counter to the idea that ""PBM executives are these monopolous fat cats lighting cigars with hundred dollar bills. It's not that. They actually do things that matter to people.""He also noted that CVS could respond by increasing the cost of the business segment it is keeping in the new contract with Blue Shield.Markovich said anything is possible, but the contracts are in place and renegotiating them could be a breach.The plan has been in the works for more than two years, with a lengthy request for proposal process, which began just before the pandemic, he said.The announcement has excited watchers of health care industry trends, who anticipate other Blues and employer plans could emulate the strategy.""Almost every investor we spoke with felt the consortium hired by Blue Shield was risky at best to be able to execute on the new business,"" UBS's Caliendo wrote. ""We tend to agree, but also understand that this thesis is not likely to be proven anytime soon given timing on onboarding.""We do think the idea that PBM contracting will be increasingly 'unbundled'...perhaps leading to lower overall profits from purchasing, rebates, and couponing.""Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

WST is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its robust proprietary products business. The optimism led by a solid second-quarter 2023 performance and its continued strength in research and development (R&amp;D) also buoy optimism. However, information security breaches and macroeconomic challenges are major downsides.Over the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 22.9% compared with 8.9% growth of the industry and a 3.8% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global provider of innovative solutions for injectable drug administration has a market capitalization of $29.17 billion. The company projects 4.6% growth for the next five years and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. West Pharmaceutical surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average surprise being 12.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Proprietary Products Segment: We are upbeat about West Pharmaceutical’s proprietary products business, which continues to exhibit sustained strength and is an important contributor to the company’s top line. In the second quarter of 2023, high-value products or HVP (components and devices) represented more than 70% of segment sales, led by customer demand for Westar components and HVP devices. The Generics market unit had high-single-digit organic net sales growth and the Pharma market unit had mid-single-digit organic net sales growth during the same time.Continued Strength in R&amp;D: West Pharmaceutical maintains its research-scale production facilities and laboratories for creating new products and provides contract engineering design and development services to help customers with new product development. These raise our optimism. In second-quarter 2023, the company’s R&amp;D expenses increased from the prior-year quarter. WST continues to invest in elastomeric packaging components, formulation development, drug containment systems, self-injection systems and drug administration consumables.Story continuesStrong Q2 Results: West Pharmaceutical’s organic growth in second-quarter 2023 buoys optimism. The company expects business performance in the second half of 2023 to be better than the first half, reflecting higher top-line and bottom-line outlooks. This also looks promising for the stock.DownsidesInformation Security Breaches: West Pharmaceutical’s systems and networks, along with that of its customers and other stakeholders, might have become the target of cyberattacks and information security breaches in the future. This can lead to unauthorized release and misuse of confidential or proprietary information about the company and its employees or customers and can also hamper or damage its operations or that of third parties. Failure to comply with regulations or prevent the unauthorized access can result in financial losses and hurt the company’s reputation.Macroeconomic Challenges: Uncertainty in the global economy, which includes recession or slow economic growth in the United States, Europe or emerging markets in Asia and South America, can have adverse effects on the company’s operating results. If there is a weakness in economic conditions in the country or Europe, or emerging markets, the company’s operations might be negatively impacted.Estimate TrendWest Pharmaceutical has been witnessing an upward estimate revision trend for 2023.

201,401eac99-e2ea-38ec-af66-c96a29b72383,MCK,2023-08-19,Nevro's (NVRO) New Data Supports SCS Therapy for PDN Treatment,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nevros-nvro-data-supports-scs-170100911.html,1692378060,STORY,"['NVRO', 'PDCO', 'HQY', 'MCK']","[Nevro Corp. NVRO recently announced the publication of 24-month data from the SENZA Painful Diabetic Neuropathy (PDN) Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) in Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice. The SENZA-PDN trial enrolled 216 patients with refractory PDN, where 142 patients were implanted with Nevro's high-frequency (10 kHz) spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system, Nevro HFX, and were followed for 24 months.The latest publication of favorable results is expected to strengthen Nevro’s foothold in the SCS therapy business.Significance of the DataPer Nevro’s estimates, the number of diabetics has quadrupled in the last two decades globally, and PDN is one of its most common complications, affecting up to 25% of people with diabetes. PDN symptoms, which can significantly impact the quality of life, include numbness and tingling, among others. Patients typically manage complications with oral pain medications, but the efficacy of these medications is relatively low and can result in intolerable side effects for patients. This may lead PDN patients to suffer significantly-reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and other comorbidities like sleep disorders, depression and anxiety.However, the published 24-month data from the SENZA-PDN RCT demonstrated that patients who received a high-frequency 10 kHz SCS implant and conventional medical management (CMM) experienced durable pain relief and significant improvements in both HRQoL and sleep at 24 months post-implantation, unlike CMM alone. Additionally, most participants experienced neurological symptom improvements. The long-term data further supports 10 kHz SCS as a safe and highly-effective therapy for PDN and a therapy that establishes durable quality-of-life improvements.Per an expert associated with the SENZA-PDN RCT, the 24-month data validates that high-frequency SCS is a viable and long-term relief solution for people with PDN. This shows promise for a condition that naturally worsens over time.Story continuesPer Nevro's management, the latest data indicating the long-term efficacy of Nevro HFX to treat people suffering from PDN worldwide is encouraging as high-frequency 10 kHz SCS demonstrated greater pain reduction and higher responder rates over time, unlike previous studies assessing traditional low-frequency systems for these patients.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Market Data Forecast, the global SCS market was estimated to be $2207 million in 2023 and is anticipated to reach $3334 million by 2028 at a CAGR of 8.6%. Factors like rising cases of chronic and neuropathic pain and the growing adoption of SCS therapy are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the publication of the latest positive data is expected to significantly boost Nevro’s business.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, Nevro announced the launch of HFX Connect in Europe to deliver comprehensive, life-changing solutions for treating chronic pain. The company also announced the receipt of the CE mark for label expansion of the HFX SCS system to include PDN and non-surgical back pain.The same month, Nevro reported its second-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered a solid improvement in overall top-line results and robust domestic and international revenues. An uptick in total U.S. permanent implant procedures and U.S. trial procedures was also recorded. An improvement in U.S. PDN trial procedures was also witnessed.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 60.1% in the past year compared with the industry’s 4.5% decline. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed a 3.8% growth in the said time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Nevro carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Patterson Companies, Inc.

(NYSE:CMI) For Its Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-interested-cummins-inc-120306594.html,1692446586,STORY,['CMI'],"[It looks like Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Cummins investors that purchase the stock on or after the 24th of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 7th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.68 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$6.72 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Cummins stock has a trailing yield of around 2.9% on the current share price of $233.62. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether Cummins can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for Cummins If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see Cummins paying out a modest 35% of its earnings. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Over the last year, it paid out more than three-quarters (81%) of its free cash flow generated, which is fairly high and may be starting to limit reinvestment in the business.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see Cummins has grown its earnings rapidly, up 25% a year for the past five years.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Cummins has delivered an average of 13% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.To Sum It UpIs Cummins an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, Cummins paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow. There's a lot to like about Cummins, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.So while Cummins looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. To help with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Cummins that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

The signs of financial stress were all there. Lower-than-expected revenue. The high cost of sales. Even as the company’s cash burn slowed, lenders applied a vice grip in the form of restrictive loan covenants.Proterra had tried without success last spring to find a buyer for its flagging electric transit bus business. Incentives to help customers offset the upfront cost of buying a bus didn’t help. Proterra was eating 8%-15% cost increases from suppliers. Heavy customization added costs across the three or so years between writing an order and delivering buses to a city.Asset auctions coming this fallIn filing for protection from creditors — including a $175 million loan that prohibited Proterra from raising capital elsewhere — the company is seeking buyers for some or all of its three businesses. Parties interested in so-called Track A — Proterra Transit and Proterra Energy — can queue up beginning in October. A sale hearing is scheduled Oct. 26.Track B — all company assets not sold in Track A including Proterra Powered and software-as-a-service business Valence — would be offered in a single sale in November.Making transit buses doesn’t command big margins. Proterra builds about 60 electric buses a quarter. It delivered 42 in Q1. It is sitting on a $292 million inventory of parts, buses in process, finished units and service parts. That compares to about $170 million a year ago.Some cities, like Austin, Texas, eagerly await buses they’ve ordered. Other municipalities are short on cash, meaning Proterra carries high receivables — $82 million at the end of June, down from $130 million a year ago. Enticing incentive payouts often get tangled in red tape.OEMs or private equity may find a dealBecause bankruptcy wipes clean the ugly financials, private equity or an OEM that passed in the spring could be more interested now. But who? Probably not Daimler Truck North America, a Proterra investor. Its Thomas Built Buses and Freightliner Custom Chassis Corp. units get  Proterra battery packs, but neither serves the transit bus space. Daimler Coaches imports the Mercedes-Benz Tourrider from Turkey. Coaches have little in common with transit buses.Story continuesUnder the hood of a Thomas Built Jouley electric school bus powered by a Proterra battery. (Photo: Alan Adler/FreightWaves)Volvo Group is ending its Nova Bus business in the U.S., selling off transit bus inventory and closing its Plattsburgh, New York, manufacturing plant by 2025.Gillig, the leading U.S. manufacturer of heavy-duty transit buses, partners with Cummins Inc. and has delivered more than 100 electric transit buses.Is Cummins in the game?Does that make Cummins a logical bidder for the Proterra bus works? Maybe. Or maybe Cummins just tries to lure customers concerned that Proterra won’t be around.Since rebranding its New Power division as Accelera, Cummins has been beefing up its nondiesel efforts, notably through fuel cells and hydrogen-producing electrolyzers. But there could be a fit with existing transit bus customers if Cummins can get a good price in auction.Gillig buses are built in Livermore, California, making them eligible for Inflation Reduction Act and California incentives.A Gillig electric transit bus made in cooperation with Cummins Inc. (Photo: Cummins)Proterra’s 2nd battery line cleared to shipWith the bankruptcy court’s blessing, Proterra is conducting business as usual, using some of its $221 million in cash and short-term investments to keep making battery packs. It was cleared to begin shipping from a second production line at the new Powered 1 plant in Greer, South Carolina, this week.Customers seem sanguine about receiving the Proterra batteries they’ve ordered. Lightning eMotors claims sufficient Proterra battery packs and is confident of getting what it ordered through 2024, CEO Tim Reeser told analysts this week.Nikola, stung by its purchase a year ago of its primary pack maker Romeo Power, considered Proterra a backup supplier for its fuel cell electric vehicles. With Romeo being liquidated, Proterra is now the primary source for batteries on what has become Nikola’s main product.“They’ve been a great battery supplier and we expect them to continue to be a great battery supplier. We expect they will come through this Chapter 11 process,” Nikola CEO Steve Girsky told me this week on Truck Tech. “We’ve gotten no indication that there’s any liquidity issues whatsoever there.“We expect Proterra to supply all of our fuel cell trucks. That said, we constantly look for other sources down the line.”Nikola’s former manufacturing partner, Iveco, will use Proterra batteries in both its battery-electric and fuel cell electric trucks, rebranded from Nikola following the end of their joint venture. With its sister powertrain division, FPT, could Iveco be a possible buyer for Proterra’s battery business?Or maybe somebody we’ve never heard of emerges.A pallet of Proterra battery packs at Nikola’s plant in Coolidge, Arizona.

It needed something new.ElectraMeccanica sees Tevva’s 16,538-pound battery and fuel cell electric trucks as a good way to fill its 285,000-square-foot plant coming online in 2025 in Mesa, Arizona. Tevva will hold most of the equity in the merged company — 76.5%. ElectraMeccanica, which has about $89 million on its books, will hold the rest.The deal needs the approval of ElectraMeccanica and Tevva shareholders and other signoffs.The Tevva electric truck is expected to be on North American roads in a few years.

Yahoo Finance Entertainment Reporter Alexandra Canal details the scrutiny Disney's special tax district has come under by the DeSantis administration and the free speech implications Disney representatives are arguing these restrictions are having on the company.Video Transcript- Well, Disney going on offense in its battle with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal is joining us now with those details. Ali.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well another day, another development in this ongoing DeSantis versus Disney feud. The latest being that Disney has now countersued DeSantis's oversight district or what was formerly known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District.Now, it's important to note that this filing is separate from the federal case that Disney launched against DeSantis earlier this year. But similar points are made. Now, in this filing in particular, Disney filed an answer to the oversight board's lawsuit along with listing nine new counterclaims that allege the board is in breach of two contracts it secured to develop and maintain control of its 25,000 acre land, a.k.a. what was formerly known as Reedy Creek.Now, this was the special tax district that allowed Disney to operate as its own self-governing entity. But after entering into those contracts, DeSantis removed Disney's handpicked Reedy Creek board members. And Florida lawmakers retroactively invalidated the contracts.So Disney now is asking for unspecified monetary damages exceeding $50,000. And for the judge overseeing the case to force the new district board to comply with what Disney says are its duties under the agreement. So breach of contract certainly number one here. But Disney is also alleging that the board's actions violate its free speech rights protected under Florida's state constitution. And we know that was a very big sticking point in Disney's federal lawsuit. So just a lot to keep up here.There have been multiple lawsuits, countersuits throughout the course of this, both on the state level as well as the federal level. And of course, this comes just a few days after Ron DeSantis signaled in an interview earlier this week that he wants to end the feud with Disney and that he has moved on. He wants Disney to drop the lawsuit. But clearly, that doesn't seem to be in the cards, at least right now.- And certainly, well, it doesn't look like Disney is going to let DeSantis walk away that easily. All right, Ali. Thanks.]"

Ron DeSantis and was selected to the position in May by DeSantis' appointees who took control of the governing district's board. The takeover was in retaliation for Disney’s public opposition to the “ Don’t Say Gay ” legislation championed by DeSantis and Republican lawmakers.Members on the ethics commission don't earn a salary. Gilzean earns an annual salary of $400,000 as the administrator of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.Gilzean had asked the ethics commission's lawyer to issue an opinion on whether it was kosher to hold both positions. The district is a taxing district and a political subdivision of the state of Florida, making Gilzean a public employee, according to the opinion from Steven Zuilkowski, the commission's general counsel.“Maintaining the public employment is inconsistent with the requirements” of being a commission member, the opinion said.An email seeking comment was sent Friday to Gilzean and a spokesperson for the district.A fight between DeSantis and Disney began last year after the company, facing significant pressure internally and externally, publicly opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades.As punishment, DeSantis took over the district through legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature and appointed a new board of supervisors to oversee municipal services for the sprawling theme parks and hotels. But the new supervisors’ authority over design and construction has been limited by the company’s agreements with Disney-supporting predecessors, which were signed before the new board took over.Story continuesIn response, Florida lawmakers passed legislation that repealed those agreements.Disney has sued DeSantis in federal court claiming the governor violated the company's free speech rights. The district has sued Disney in state court, seeking to nullify the agreements.The district asked this week for a judge to rule in its favor without a need for a trial. Disney on Thursday filed a counter-claim asking the judge for the same thing, except in the company's favor.“Disney faces concrete, imminent, and ongoing injury as a result of the contractual impairment,” Disney said in a court filing.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP]"

Ron DeSantis's Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, marking the latest development in the back-and-forth saga that's plagued the media giant.Disney's filing, separate from the federal case it launched against DeSantis earlier this year, was filed late Thursday in Florida's Ninth Judicial Circuit Court in Orange County, the state court where the Oversight District brought its case against the company in May.Disney filed an answer to the Oversight Board's lawsuit, along with nine new counterclaims that allege the board is in breach of two contracts it secured to develop and maintain control over its 25,000-acre parcel, formerly known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District (RCID).The special tax district has allowed Disney to operate as a self-governing entity since its inception.Disney, in addition to paying property taxes to Orange and Osceola counties, paid taxes directly to Reedy Creek. In turn, the district used that money to fund Disney's various theme park projects and operations, including infrastructure upkeep.That meant Disney controlled all of its utilities and infrastructure, set building codes, operated its own police and fire departments, and could expand and grow whenever it wished — all without local or state government interference.After entering into the contracts, DeSantis removed Disney's hand-picked RCID board members, and Florida lawmakers retroactively invalidated the contracts.Disney is asking for unspecified monetary damages exceeding $50,000 and for the judge overseeing the case to force the new district board to comply with what Disney says are its duties under the agreements.""Disney has no adequate legal remedy for the District’s breach of the Contracts, as an award of damages would not fully compensate Disney for the losses caused by the District’s breach of the Contracts,"" the company wrote in its request for the relief known as ""specific performance.""Story continuesIn addition, Disney alleges that the board's actions violate its free speech rights protected under Florida's state constitution.The countersuit comes after DeSantis, now running for the Republican nomination for president, signaled earlier this week that he wants to end his longtime feud with Disney.""We've basically moved on. They’re suing the state of Florida. They're going to lose that lawsuit,"" DeSantis said in an interview with CNBC on Monday.""So what I would say is, drop the lawsuit,"" DeSantis added. ""Let's move forward. I'm totally fine with that, but I'm not fine with giving extraordinary privileges to one special company at the exclusion of everybody else.""The ongoing political firestorm, which has seen multiple lawsuits and countersuits from both parties, stems from what Disney characterizes as a politically targeted response over Disney's reaction to the so-called ""Don't Say Gay"" law. The law, the Parental Rights in Education Act, forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity from kindergarten through third grade.In 2022, then-Disney CEO Bob Chapek condemned the law at the company's annual shareholder meeting after initially declining to speak publicly on the matter.In response, DeSantis signed a bill into law that allowed him to take control of the company's long-standing special tax district.Republican presidential candidate Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a Fair-Side Chat with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds at the Iowa State Fair, Saturday, Aug. 12, 2023, in Des Moines, Iowa. Disney has countersued DeSantis's Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, marking the latest development in the back-and-forth saga that's plagued the media giant. (Jeff Roberson/AP Photo)Prior to the countersuit, Florida's attorney general filed a motion to dismiss an April lawsuit from the entertainment giant, arguing immunity for DeSantis.Disney had alleged in federal court that DeSantis and other officials launched a ""targeted campaign of government retaliation"" for its stance on the parental rights bill when the state stripped the company of the self-governing power it held for 55 years.Florida Circuit Court Judge Margaret Schreiber also denied Disney's request to dismiss the state's case against it.During Monday's interview, DeSantis stressed the benefits of Florida's economy, which remained mostly open throughout the pandemic.""No one has made Disney more money recently than me because during COVID they were open in Florida,"" he argued. ""[Disney] was locked shut in California, and we said we want you guys to operate because we understand how important it was that their cast members in central Florida had the ability to make ends meet.""""This is a great place to do business,"" DeSantis added. ""Your competitors all do very well here, Universal, SeaWorld. They have not had the same special privileges as you have.

That is because the Jan 19, 2024 $35.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Exelon shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Exelon is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Utility - Electric Power industry that ranks in the Bottom 20% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has revised the estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 9 cents per share to 7 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Exelon right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the performance of the NASDAQ index, head directly to 5 Best NASDAQ ETFs. In the last 15 years, the S&amp;P and Dow Jones indices have shown similar movement about 94% of the time, as monitored by CNBC. The S&amp;P and NASDAQ have also exhibited synchronized movement about 92% of the time during the same period. However, in 2023, the NASDAQ has stood out by delivering a near 30% return. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P has achieved a return of approximately 15%, and the Dow has lagged behind with a modest 5% gain as of August 18. The recent remarkable performance of the NASDAQ can be attributed to the strong rally in tech and communications stocks. The major holdings of the index, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), have all achieved returns greater than 30% in 2023 so far. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) notably stands out with an impressive gain of 218%. However, it's important to note that the flip side is true as well – when investors divest from tech stocks, the impact can be devastating. During the dotcom bubble burst from 2000 to 2002, the NASDAQ experienced a substantial decline of 78%, in contrast to a 49% drop in the S&amp;P 500 and 34% in the Dow.Don't Miss: 10 Best Consumer Staples ETFsThe market capitalization of companies listed on the NASDAQ-100 has increased by close to $5 trillion since the beginning of this year. As indicated by past trends, the strong performance of the NASDAQ-100 so far suggests a positive outlook for the rest of 2023. The market's interest in generative AI has overshadowed potential negative headlines this year, such as recession fears, inflation, Fed rate hikes, geopolitical risks, debt-ceiling concerns, and regional bank failures. Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James, told Bloomberg Television: Story continues“I still do like big tech. I do believe in technology continuing to reinvent itself — obviously with the latest addition being AI. That’ll continue to drive earnings.”Similarly, Sundeep Gantori, equity strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management, commented in July 2023: “We don’t believe the AI trend is a bubble, but advise investors to be selective on AI-related stocks after the strong year-to-date rally. From a positioning point of view, we recently closed our self-help theme as we see better risk-reward in mid-cycle industries (software, internet) and tech laggards.”Also Read: 10 Best Industrial ETFsAs per the Nasdaq Index Research Team, most of the 107 tracked indexes displayed positive performance in July 2023, with 87% ending in the month green and the remaining 13% in losses. The average return for all indexes was 3.4%. The NASDAQ-100 index continued its five-month positive streak, gaining 3.8%. The top performer was the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, rising by 11.4%, while the Dorsey Wright Healthcare Technical Leaders Index declined by 4.3%, ranking as the weakest performer.

Results in the last three months were driven by a long-time media position in Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), which we consider a durable compounder due to its consistent revenue growth and free cash flow generation. Comcast shares saw a snapback after a difficult first half of the year caused by cord cutting in its cable business and slowing subscriber growth in its broadband business. A flexible balance sheet and strong cash generation enabled the company to repurchase shares during the selloff earlier in the year.”11.

We have sized up our investments in certain cloud software businesses including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), a clear AI winner as a result of its rapidly growing Azure cloud business, upside from applying AI features to its core Office products, investment in Open AI, and ability to provide AI services to other companies (for example, Microsoft holds a stake in one of our portfolio companies, LSE, which it is also assisting in harnessing greater value in its data via AI).”10.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Dramatic valuation differences across market cap sizes continue. This has been the case for some time now. Perhaps I have spent too much time discussing these dichotomies, as generally, I feel like if we pick the right stocks and manage market exposures thoughtfully, our equities- oriented portfolio will prosper across various market cycles. However, when markets become as lopsided as they have lately, I feel additional discussion on the market environment is worthwhile, if only to help highlight the opportunities that are available and the likely path forward. I expect future discussions to soon be focused again on our moderately concentrated portfolio. But for now, let’s take one last in-depth look at how far reaching these valuation dichotomies have again become.(Please note: charts that accompany the following can be found in the Appendix.)Take Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for example. It is the largest stock by market cap, and fairly considered one of the best companies in the world. The company has been extraordinarily successful and improved standards of living everywhere in the process with their ubiquitous products. Along the way, shareholders have been richly rewarded, with shares increasing nearly fourteen-fold over the last ten years while generating an annualized total shareholder return of 31%, including dividends.On the back of another big quarter for large cap tech, it is now the first stock to surpass the $3T market cap threshold. This makes its weighting in the ~$37T market cap of the S&amp;P 500, ~8%. It also means this one stock’s market cap is larger than that of the entire ~$2.98T market cap of the Russell 2000 index, the first time in history a single stock has outweighed the Russell 2000 – aside from two brief days in September 2020 when Apple’s market cap then accomplished the same…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

We have been gradually trimming our investment to, what we call, an ‘optionality’ size position as the stock price has dramatically gone up. Conditions are chalk and cheese to when we first purchased our investment.Recent news makes us think twice: PyTorch 2.0, the machine learning framework recently announced support for AMD GPUs which is a negative for NVIDIA.For many readers, this may be getting into the weeds but in our May 2021 letter, we discussed one aspect of NVIDIA’s competitive edge – its proprietary CUDA software. Operating as the interface between their GPUs and machine learning (ML) libraries, CUDA has become the standard layer in the AI stack to enable parallelised processing, a critical function for complex neural network models. Competing, cheaper, GPUs with inferior working libraries struggled to gain meaningful traction because the early versions of machine learning libraries (PyTorch and TensorFlow) did not directly interface with them. This created friction for developers and effectively blocked cheaper competitor GPUs from handling machine learning workloads….” (Click here to read the full text)6.

216,be19bbad-c553-3cdb-b153-04aa7f14525e,ORCL,2023-08-19,How Index Ventures jumped to the front of the AI GPU line,TechCrunch,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/be19bbad-c553-3cdb-b153-04aa7f14525e/how-index-ventures-jumped-to.html,1692429055,STORY,['ORCL'],"[Earlier this week, The New York Times shone a light on some of the desperation that founders are experiencing as they try and fail to secure compute power for their nascent artificial intelligence startups, thanks to the big companies (and even rich nations) racing to snatch them up. One founder reportedly said of the graphics processing units, or GPUs, that he needs for his company: ""I think about [them] as a rare earth metal at this point.""According to that Times piece, founders are trying numerous measures to amass the chips, including calling in favors from friends at large equipment vendors that might have GPUs to spare, and navigating an obscure U.S. government program called Access.At least one firm, the global investor Index Ventures, happened on an additional idea, it told the outlet. To help ensure its portfolio companies aren't hamstrung by the shortage, it struck a deal with Oracle to provide its founders with some of these sought-after chips (specifically Nvidia’s H100 chips and Nvidia's A100 chips).To learn more about the arrangement -- one that other venture firms are undoubtedly trying to replicate -- we talked earlier today with Erin Price-Wright, a Bay Area-based partner with Index who focuses on enterprise software and AI and who, before joining the venture firm in 2019, was the head of product for Palantir’s data analytics and machine learning platform. Excerpts from our chat have been lightly edited for length and clarity below; you can hear our longer conversation here.TechCrunch: Tell us about this partnership with Oracle. Erin Price-Wright: Access to compute is one of the biggest challenges that AI companies face, and it's especially hard for an early-stage company to get their hands on GPUs. It's less about the cost in particular but the fact that something like more than 95% of GPU capacity is already allocated to large players in this space [because] they make these pretty big pre-commitments with cloud vendors. So if you're an early-stage company, and you're just trying to get started training, or fine tuning the model, there's usually a really long lead time between when GPUs are even available. It can be three months to a year in some cases and it's really hard to just get started.Story continuesIf you're an early-stage company that's still figuring out what your product is, you don't even know how many GPUs you need. So even that process of discovery of understanding what your workloads are going to look like can be super challenging for early-stage companies. So we're partnering with Oracle to provide GPUs to our earliest-stage portfolio companies, because we want to help remove that barrier of access so that they can really focus on what matters from day zero. Ultimately, the goal is to help all of these companies graduate to their own cluster. We're not in the business of providing these massive GPU clusters to our companies. . .but we really want to give them a head start, so that they can start building faster as a way to help level the playing field.How did the deal come together?We wanted to make sure that people who are building against very tangible business problems didn't feel like they had to change their business model or change the way they were representing themselves or change the way they were fundraising in order to just get access to GPUs. So it was really born out of seeing this pattern again and again with early-stage companies where we were like, 'This is where Index as a fund actually has real leverage. And we can use our position in the market, our relationships, and the fact that we can kind of aggregate this demand across multiple companies to really provide value-additive services' [to our founders].Did Index put a down payment together or has it purchased chips outright from Oracle? Are you giving Oracle a stake in these startups?We're not purchasing any chips outright. So the partnership with Oracle is that Index makes the precommitment on the behalf of our startups and pays the cloud bill. Oracle manages the cluster -- they've been a fantastic partner -- and then our companies get access to that GPU cluster for free.So you're paying [this cloud bill] in advance. Did you have to talk with your own investors about that? That's not typical of what [a venture firm] would do historically.In terms of the actual structure of how the agreement works, I'll probably hold off on sharing too many of those details.Is this an exclusive relationship? Is there anything to prevent other venture firms from doing the same thing?Yeah, of course [they could do the same], there certainly isn't [an exclusive relationship with Index].One benefit that Oracle gets out of it is to meet the next generation of fantastic companies as early as possible. In the process of using our GPU cluster, we're actively helping our companies navigate the process of signing their own dedicated cloud deal. So the idea is not for them to [do] this in perpetuity; it's for them to develop relationships with Oracle and AWS and the other large cloud providers and sign their own dedicated contract.One of your portfolio companies, Cohere, counts Oracle as one of its backers along with Nvidia, which are two of the companies you most want to have involved with your portfolio companies right now.One of the ways we really can help our portfolio companies is making sure they're connected to the right people at the right time, so that they get the resources they need.Index has at least 20 portfolio companies that fall into the AI/ML bucket, including Cohere [which has already raised $445 million] and another company that recently raised a huge seed round, Mistral AI in France. Is too much money being invested broadly in generative AI or are we still in the 'early innings,' as VCs like to say?We are in the early innings. I do think we're rapidly entering a cooling off period in terms of sentiment, especially for some of these very large rounds and especially from traditional VCs. There's still a really big gap between the promise and power of the core models of technology and what it's going to take for them to be actually used and useful across many use cases in the enterprise. There's just a huge infrastructure gap missing that needs to be filled, and it's not going to be filled overnight; it's going to take some time.Over the coming 12 months, while I'm still very excited about the power of the core technology and how transformational it's going to be for the world, I think we're going to see a little bit of a backing off as companies really grapple with it, figure out the ROI, kind of prioritize use cases and start actually building real things beyond maybe the one or two prototype demo apps that they've been working on for the last six months. That's when we're going to start seeing the infrastructure emerge that's going to start supporting these use cases at scale.How do you as an investor ensure that your AI companies don't overlap? And is that any harder or more difficult than when it comes to traditional startups?I don't think it's massively different than how we think about competition elsewhere. Everyone paints AI as this standalone category. But if I look forward even two years, let alone five or 10, every single piece of software that we use will have AI as its beating heart. There will be no piece of code, no software, no application, no website that you visit, that doesn't have AI as a core component of it. I almost think about it like SaaS. Is every single SaaS company the same? No. Every single SaaS company has a database, every single SaaS company has a front end, every single SaaS company has some interaction between the two. AI is kind of similar to a database in that respect. It's just kind of a core building block in how you build software.We're very early in the market, so there's going to be some movement and some change as companies figure out how to use these tools and what specific problems to go after. But it's not different than how we think about traditional SaaS investing from my perspective.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/19/how-index-ventures-jumped-to-the-front-of-the-ai-gpu-line/]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this software maker have returned -0.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Oracle falls in, has lost 7.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Oracle is expected to post earnings of $1.14 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.51 points to a change of +7.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.15 indicates a change of +11.5% from what Oracle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Oracle is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Oracle, the consensus sales estimate of $12.45 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8.8%. The $53.85 billion and $57.97 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +7.8% and +7.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOracle reported revenues of $13.84 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.9%. EPS of $1.67 for the same period compares with $1.54 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.71%. The EPS surprise was +5.7%.Over the last four quarters, Oracle surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Oracle is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Oracle. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

220,b7252144-217d-302c-9a5f-3d5ad2744ed4,AON,2023-08-19,5 Insurance Brokerage Stocks to Benefit From Higher Demand,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-insurance-brokerage-stocks-benefit-163200546.html,1692376320,STORY,"['AON', 'ERIE', '^GSPC', 'RYAN', 'MMC', 'BRO']","[Better pricing, prudent underwriting, rising demand for insurance products and global expansion have been driving revenues of the Zacks  Insurance Brokerage industry players. The fast-paced consolidations in this traditionally fragmented industry are expected to benefit Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies MMC, Aon plc AON, Brown and Brown BRO, Erie Indemnity ERIE and Ryan Specialty Holdings, Inc. RYAN.The increasing adoption of technology and higher spending on technology will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Brokerage Insurance industry comprises companies that primarily offer insurance and reinsurance products and services. Insurance brokers act on behalf of their clients and offer advice, keeping in mind clients' interests against brokerage fees. Thus, their business is directly linked with clients’ level of business activity. Some of these companies are also involved in providing risk management, third-party administration and managed healthcare services. Per a report by Allied Market Research, the global insurance brokerage market is projected to rise to $395 billion by 2027 or at an eight-year (2020-2027) CAGR of 7.3%. Research Dive estimates industry players combined to generate $515.3 billion in revenues by 2028, up at an eight-year (2021-2028) CAGR of 5.4%. Increased digitization has been helping to improve operational performance.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Insurance Brokerage IndustryIncreased Demand for Products to Drive Revenues: Industry players are continually expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products, while the rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance. Government initiatives should also add to the upside. The operational results of the industry players are affected directly by clients’ level of business activity, which, in turn, depends on the extent of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve. Also, they must design products that are more appealing to customers.  This apart, better pricing ensures higher commissions for the industry players. Mergers and Acquisitions: The insurance brokerage industry is witnessing fast-paced consolidation. The industry has been traditionally fragmented, with a number of small players. One of the factors driving mergers and acquisitions is the companies’ need to become specialized in their businesses. Some other factors driving M&amp;A are the interest shown by private equity firms in this sector, growing competition and lack of organic growth. Increased Adoption of Technology: To maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others. These players are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate. Accelerated digitalization is also helping in curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. Increased digitization will help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and retention rate. While investments in technology help increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, players must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read Goldman Sachs Dividend Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.Investors love dividend stocks because they are reliable and often a refuge during tough times when the economy and markets are wavering. More importantly, dividends have a strong history of keeping up with inflation. In the US, companies that provide dividends usually perform better during times of high inflation and increasing interest rates compared to non-dividend payers. Additionally, they're often seen as safer choices, declining less than the overall market during downturns. This defensive quality is especially significant in the current unpredictable circumstances. Since 1926, dividends have represented nearly one-third of the stock market’s overall returns.Dividend stocks experienced a slight drop this year as other asset classes began to catch the interest of investors. This doesn't mean that dividend stocks have lost their appeal, as their demand remains steady regardless of the economic situation. In one of our previous articles on dividend investing we cited data from Fidelity Investments, which mentioned that dividends made over half of the market's gains in high inflationary periods. The study also highlighted specific periods, like the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, where dividends accounted for 67%, 44%, and 73% of market gains, respectively. These decades saw inflation averaging above 5%, and overall returns were less than 10%.Also read: Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 12 Stock PicksEarlier this year, David Kostin, a Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist, gave an optimistic view regarding dividend stocks. He expects a 5% increase in dividend payments from S&amp;P 500 companies this year, with the potential for further growth. Here are some comments from the analyst:""We expect that S&amp;P 500 DPS [dividend-per-share] will reach $70 in 2023 and $73 (+4%) in 2024. Recent company actions also point to a healthy dividend growth environment. The difference in outlooks for dividend and buyback growth suggests firms focusing on dividends will continue to outperform buyback stocks.""Story continuesHe further mentioned that investors often consider companies that have long dividend growth histories because such companies are often financially sound, with the ability to generate sustained profits. By continuously boosting dividends, these companies prioritize providing returns to their shareholders, appealing to those seeking stable income and potential capital appreciation.In this article, we will discuss the top dividend stocks in Goldman Sachs's portfolio. Some of them include NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and S&amp;P Global Inc.

223,7ab7f165-feed-3393-8707-e3b6d2c0e7d1,MCD,2023-08-19,Here is What to Know Beyond Why McDonald's Corporation (MCD) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-mcdonalds-corporation-130012510.html,1692363612,STORY,['MCD'],"[McDonald's (MCD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this world's biggest hamburger chain have returned -5.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.3% change. The Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, to which McDonald's belongs, has lost 6.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.McDonald's is expected to post earnings of $2.98 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.8%.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.49 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +13.8%. This estimate has changed +3.7% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.41 indicates a change of +8% from what McDonald's is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, McDonald's is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of McDonald's, the consensus sales estimate of $6.56 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.7%. The $25.46 billion and $27.37 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.8% and +7.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMcDonald's reported revenues of $6.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.6%. EPS of $3.17 for the same period compares with $2.55 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.31%. The EPS surprise was +14.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.McDonald's is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about McDonald's. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Bank of America Corporation (BAC). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Apple shares have struggled lately, with the stock losing losing -11.6% of its value since the start of August, lagging the Zacks Tech sector's -7.3% decline and the S&amp;P 500 index's -4.6% pullback. This recent weakness notwithstanding, the stock has been a standout performer this year, handily outperforming the Tech sector as well as the broader market.  The company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade, as well as the launch of its high-yield savings account with Apple Card, helped in driving subscriber growth.Apple’s results also benefited from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption among enterprises. Apple expects iPhone and Services’ year-over-year growth to accelerate in fiscal fourth-quarter as compared with the June quarter.However, revenues for both Mac and iPad are expected to decline by double digits on a year-over-year basis due to difficult comparison.

That said, Nvidia's performance this year is one for the record books, with the stock up +192.9% this year vs. +32.7% for the Tech sector and +15.2% for the market. Story continuesNvidia has literally been in a league of its own since its last quarterly release on May 24th when it raised guidance by a magnitude that we have never seen from another company. With the company on deck to report results on Wednesday, August 23rd, it is under the spotlight as to whether the preceding quarter's numbers were a one-off or the start of a sustained period of outperformance. The company is gaining from strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute &amp; Networking revenues.A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.However, NVDA’s near-term prospects look gloomy due to weakening demand for chips used in gaming and professional visualization end markets. While macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and professional visualization chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Bank of America have underperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past six months (-10.9% vs. -15.9%). The tough economic backdrop is expected to keep weighing on investment banking (IB) business. This, along with the volatile nature of the capital markets, might hurt non-interest income. Moreover, inflationary pressure will likely result in mounting expenses.Nevertheless, Higher interest rates and decent loan demand will likely keep aiding the company’s net interest income (NII) growth.

225,3db4c177-adca-3ab6-ac02-3d42bb4a437d,PLD,2023-08-19,Here's Why You Should Hold Prologis (PLD) Stock in Your Kitty,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-hold-prologis-pld-164900255.html,1692377340,STORY,['PLD'],"[Prologis PLD is well-positioned to bank on the favorable industrial real estate market environment, backed by its solid operating platform and robust scale. The company, which has emerged as a market leader in this asset category, is witnessing solid demand for its industrial real estate, as reflected by the leasing, rent and occupancy levels of the properties.Undoubtedly, with the e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies making efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies, the demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks has risen. This is aiding the industrial real estate market to prosper and benefit Prologis, STAG Industrial STAG and First Industrial Realty Trust FR.Resilience is essential to the future of supply chains. Therefore, over the long term, apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, logistics real estate is expected to benefit from an increase in inventory levels, offering possibilities to industrial landlords, including Prologis, STAG Industrial and First Industrial Realty, to enjoy a favorable market environment.Prologis, in particular, has been witnessing a decent operating performance. The average occupancy level in Prologis’ owned and managed portfolio remained high at 97.5% in the second quarter of 2023. Further, 43.3 million square feet (msf) of leases commenced in the company’s owned and managed portfolio, with 38.4 msf in the operating portfolio and 4.9 msf in the development portfolio. The retention level was 70.5% in the quarter.Prologis’ share of net effective rent change was 78.5% in the April-June quarter, which marked an all-time high and was led by the United States at 91.7%. Also, the cash rent change of 48.1% represented an all-time high. Cash same-store net operating income (NOI) grew 10.7% in the second quarter.With healthy operating fundamentals in industrial real estate markets, Prologis has capitalized on growth opportunities through acquisitions and developments. Its investments over the years comprise a wide array, including the largest M&amp;A transactions in the real estate sector and individual off-market deals below $5 million. Last year, PLD closed the acquisition of Duke Realty, thereby boosting its presence in the key markets of the United States.In June 2023, the company concluded the buyout of nearly 14 million square feet of industrial properties from opportunistic real estate funds affiliated with Blackstone for a cash consideration of $3.1 billion. The move significantly enhanced Prologis’ presence in key U.S. markets, poising it well for long-term growth. For 2023, PLD anticipates acquisitions at Prologis share between $300 million and $600 million, while development starts are expected in the range of $2.5-$3 billion.Prologis is focused on bolstering its liquidity. This industrial REIT’s liquidity amounted to $6.36 billion in cash and availability on its credit facilities as of Jun 30, 2023. In addition, the company’s credit ratings as of Jun 30, 2023 were A3 (Outlook Stable) from Moody’s and A (Outlook Stable) from Standard &amp; Poor’s, enabling the company to borrow at an advantageous rate. Given its balance sheet strength and prudent financial management, PLD is well-poised to capitalize on growth opportunities.Moreover, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and Prologis is committed to that. In the last five years, Prologis has increased its dividend five times, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 13.43%. Check Prologis’ dividend history here.However, with the asset category being attractive even during challenging times, there is a development boom in many markets. The high supply is likely to fuel competition and curb pricing power. New supply is likely to create pressure on vacancy levels and rent growth to some extent in the upcoming quarters. Furthermore, recovery in the industrial market has continued for long, and the growth of e-commerce sales is likely to stabilize to some extent in the upcoming quarters.Moreover, a high interest rate is a concern for Prologis. Elevated rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Further, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money-market accounts.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 6.6% year to date against the industry’s decline of 5.7%.

For the current year, the consensus mark for earnings has moved 9.5% south in the same time frame. The unfavorable estimate revisions indicate brokers’ lack of confidence in the stock.Weak Zacks Rank and Style Score: UPS currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Moreover, the company’s current Momentum Style Score of C shows its short-term unattractiveness.An Underperformer: The UPS stock has lost 1.8% year to date against its industry’s 12.5% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Headwinds: While releasing second-quarter 2023 results earlier in the month, management trimmed its current-year revenue outlook. It now expects 2023 revenues to be around $93 billion (prior view: $97 billion). The new forecast is also much lower than levels. Management cited costs associated with the labor deal, inked with 330,000 unionized workers, and declining package volumes induced by labor negotiations as reasons for lowering the outlook.The five-year deal with International Brotherhood of Teamsters for better payments and working conditions is worth about $30 billion. It is likely to keep labor costs at high levels.  As a result of higher pay, induced by the deal, there are risks of a wage-price spiral being created.Since prices are increasing, workers will, naturally, demand additional compensation. This, in turn, may push prices even higher, raising concerns that inflation levels are likely to remain elevated. Apart from the mentioned adverse effects of labor negotiations, weakening demand due to economic slowdown has also led to a decline in volume of packages shipped.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector may consider stocks like United Airlines UAL and Air Transport Services ATSG. UAL and ATSG currently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesUnited Airlines is seeing steady recovery in domestic and international air-travel demand. Owing to this, UAL expects revenues for the September quarter to grow 10-13% year over year. Our projection for third-quarter total revenues hints at an increase of 11.4% year over year.For third-quarter 2023, United Airlines anticipates capacity to improve 16% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UAL’s current-year earnings has been revised 19.7% upward over the past 60 days.The uptrend with respect to e-commerce even in the post-pandemic scenario is a huge positive for Air Transport Services. It is the primary driver behind the uptick in demand for midsize air freighters.With shippers replacing their older, less fuel-efficient equipment, ATSG’s freighters have emerged as suitable replacements. Driven by the upbeat demand, ATSG has delivered a record six converted freighters under lease in a month to its customers worldwide. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ATSG’s current-year earnings has been revised 8.6% upward over the past 60 days.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

QuoteFactors to NoteThe company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter is likely to have been affected due to weakness in global macroeconomic conditions, softening IT spending environment and cloud cost optimization efforts by clients.Also, unfavorable forex movements, lingering supply-chain troubles, increases in freight and logistical expenses and higher component costs are expected to have acted as headwinds.Nonetheless, the company’s performance is likely to have benefited from data-driven digital and cloud transformations involving business analytics, artificial intelligence, data security, and application modernization.The company is also focusing on its Hybrid Cloud business.

This article will cover recent industry trends and navigate through the major players in the industry. If you want to skip our analysis, go directly to the 5 Most Popular Candies in the World. According to a report by Zion Market Research, the Global Candy Market is currently valued at $12.1 billion as of 2022. The global candy market is expected to grow to $15.1 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.1%. While the North American region held the highest share of the global candy market, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to have the highest compound annual growth rate in the coming years. According to the report, the popularity of chocolate candies is one of the primary drivers of the growth of the candy industry. The increasing demand for dark chocolate and sugar-free candies is rising, constituting a major shift in the candy industry. Contrary to popular belief, candies, and snacks are not just consumed by kids, in fact, teenagers and adults are as fond of candies as kids would be. Check out some of the snacks easily available for adults.According to a report by Future Marketing Insights, the global sugar-free candy market is expected to grow from a market size of $2.3 billion in 2023 to a valuation of $3.8 billion by 2033 at a compound annual growth rate of 5.2%. Recently, people have been more driven towards living a healthier life. Therefore, cutting down on sugar is usually seen as the first step, translating to a decline in the sales of traditional sweets and chocolates. However, to keep up with the market, most companies have begun to introduce sugar-free items on their list. Some of the notable companies offering sugar-free candies and dark chocolate include The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY), Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), and Nestlé S.A (OTC:NSRGY).The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) is a popular confectionary producer in the United States. According to a post by The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY), the company introduced two new plant-based options, Reese's Plant-Based Peanut Butter Cups and Hershey's Plant-Based Extra Creamy with Almonds and Sea Salt.Story continuesMondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is a snack food and beverage company based in the United States. With growing global health concerns, the company has added products to its portfolio containing fewer calories and sugar. Trident is the first sugar-free chewing gum introduced by Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and has gained immense recognition globally.Some of the popular candies by Nestlé S.A (OTC:NSRGY) include the famous KitKat, Milkybar, Smarties, and Quality Street. In 2019 the company introduced a sugar-free version of the famous KitKat chocolate bar.Chocolate Candy: More Than Just a SnackWhile the approach to a healthier lifestyle has shaped the candy industry heavily, the chocolate industry is much more stable. You can also check out the 12 Countries That Produce the Best Chocolate. Not only have there been reports of the benefits of dark chocolate, but chocolate producers possess ways to sell their products to the consumer with their intricate marketing strategies. Whether it's Valentine's Day or a birthday, chocolate is a common denominator for the two occasions. Companies now produce products that fit well to the designated use by the customer.On February 21, Forbes reported that Dove Chocolate had partnered with Care to provide awards worth $10,000 to three female entrepreneurs in West Africa. This grant aimed to empower African women working in cocoa-growing communities willing to build small businesses. Furthermore, this year the company inculcated the use of social media to get women to submit their business pitches on Instagram or the official website. Not only does this help people to view chocolate in a different light, but it also emphasizes the social responsibility companies have towards the community, contributing to the candy's position as more than just a snack. On March 30, Food Navigator USA reported that the Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) altered its approach towards innovation. Previously, the company focused on producing products that do well on the market. However, upon identifying how candies are viewed by their potential segment, the company began introducing ""fit for purpose"" and ""occasion-based"" chocolate bars and candies. The popularity of chocolates knows no geographical borders either. To counter rising inflation costs across the world, companies are expanding to other parts of the world to acquire a larger market share. On June 5, Bloomberg reported that Ferrero, the Italian confectionary company and the name behind Nutella, is expanding its distribution channels in the United States for its Kinder chocolate brand. The company aims to make Kinder a $1 billion business in the United States, with the belief that the creamy and milky flavor of the chocolate brand will appeal to consumers in the US. However, to adapt to local tastes, the company is opening an innovation center in Chicago, United States.The popularity of candies and chocolates may stem from a range of reasons. It could either be based on purpose or on occasion at hand. Nevertheless, some candies have been catering to the global market for decades and are still consumed by kids and adults.

Many want to mirror the legend’s investing strategy and emerge a winner. Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway’s latest 13-F filing showed that Berkshire’s $348 billion portfolio was invested in 48 companies in the second quarter of 2023. Berkshire was a net seller of about $8 billion in stocks during the quarter.The top 5 holdings make up about 79% of the total portfolio. These five stocks are Apple AAPL, Bank of America BAC, American Express AXP, Coca-Cola KO, and Chevron CVX. Apart from these, Berkshire has significant weights in Occidental Petroleum OXY and Kraft Heinz KHC.With this, Buffett’s portfolio is heavy on the below-mentioned sectors and ETFs. Let’s delve a little deeper.Information TechnologyBerkshire Hathaway has 51% of weights in Apple. Apple shares have been performing better than the industry year to date. It is benefiting from steady demand for iPhone 14 and 14 Plus as well as expanding footprint in emerging markets. Growing services subscriber base and improving customer engagement are tailwinds for the services business.Apple’s focus on autonomous vehicles and augmented reality/virtual reality technologies presents a growth opportunity for the long haul. Apple-heavy ETF iShares U.S. Technology ETF IYW has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).FinancialsBuffett’s favorite America Express (with 7.59% exposure) has exposure to  ETFMG Prime Mobile Payments Fund IPAY while Bank of America (Berkshire has 8.51% weights in BAC) is heavy on the likes of iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF IYG.Digital payments have been in the front and center of consumer behavior lately. Apart from showing an increased interest in online shopping, customers are resorting to digital payments to clear their bills. Even, merchants and utility providers are increasingly advocating the same. This explains Buffett’s interest in this field.Story continuesAs far as banking stocks are concerned, though flattening yield curve could spell trouble to banking stocks, big banks still have strength. Higher rates and decent loan demand will aid net interest income (NII). The opening of financial centers and improving digital capabilities will likely bolster the top line.EnergyBerkshire invests 3.78% weights in Occidental Petroleum and 5.56% weights in Chevron. Chevron is heavy on energy ETFs like Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLE and iShares U.S. Energy ETF IYE. Occidental Petroleum has focus on First Trust Nasdaq Oil &amp; Gas ETF FTXN.Operating backdrop for the energy sector is also upbeat. Chances of a recession in several economies is also lower (which indicates decent demand for energy), though a soft landing is expected in many geographies.Consumer StaplesThis is a safe sector as it is non-cyclical in nature. The consumer staples sector tends to do well even amid economic growth slowdown and high inflation. Since consumers have to buy staples products even if they cut back on their discretionary spending, big manufacturers of food and beverages normally have the power to pass on the increase in costs to customers.Buffett’s favorite Coca-Cola has substantial weight in ETFs like iShares U.S. Consumer Staples ETF (IYK). Kraft Heinz has a focus on Invesco Dynamic Food &amp; Beverage ETF (PBJ).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

233,b76d5896-26ef-384f-b4c7-846cc3149d12,OXY,2023-08-19,Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-corporation-oxy-attracting-130011390.html,1692363611,STORY,['OXY'],"[Occidental Petroleum (OXY) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned +4.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, which Occidental falls in, has gained 9.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Occidental is expected to post earnings of $0.98 per share, indicating a change of -59.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -20.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.85 points to a change of -58.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -15.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.17 indicates a change of +34.4% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -11%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Occidental is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Occidental, the consensus sales estimate of $7.25 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -23.7%. The $28.46 billion and $30.71 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -23.3% and +7.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $6.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -37.3%. EPS of $0.68 for the same period compares with $3.16 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.8 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.95%. The EPS surprise was -2.86%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ULTA is likely to register top-and-bottom-line growth when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Aug 24.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2,503 million, suggesting an increase of nearly 9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line has improved from $5.81 to $5.84 over the past seven days. The projection indicates 2.5% growth from earnings reported in the year-ago period. This cosmetics, fragrance, haircare and skincare products company has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 15.9%, on average.Ulta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseUlta Beauty Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Ulta Beauty Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderThe company’s focus on its six strategic priorities has been working well. Ulta Beauty’s foremost priority is to strengthen its omnichannel business and explore the potential of both physical and digital facets. Next, the company has been undertaking various tools to enhance the experience of guests, like offering a virtual try-on tool and in-store education, and reimagining fixtures, among others.Thirdly, ULTA concentrates on offering customers a curated and exclusive range of beauty products through innovation. Moving on, the company is focused on deepening customer engagement by boosting rewards and loyalty programs. Fifthly, management is committed to optimizing its cost structure. Apart from these, management strives to boost organizational talent and strengthen culture. These upsides bode well for the second quarter.Ulta Beauty’s skincare category has been gaining from consumers’ rising interest in self-care and the company’s product newness. The trend continued in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein skincare was the company’s best-performing category.ULTA saw double-digit growth in both mass and prestige. While the operating landscape is likely to keep evolving, management remains confident about the resilience of the beauty category, which is likely to have aided second-quarter performance.However, the company has been seeing a rise in SG&amp;A costs for a while now. Management expects SG&amp;A deleverage in fiscal 2023 due to strategic investments as well as overall cost inflation. It also expects increased gross margin deleverage in the fiscal year due to the effects of increased shrink and a more competitive and promotional landscape. These aspects raise concerns for the quarter under review. We expect an SG&amp;A cost increase of 19.7% in the second quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Ulta Beauty this time.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read Goldman Sachs Dividend Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.Investors love dividend stocks because they are reliable and often a refuge during tough times when the economy and markets are wavering. More importantly, dividends have a strong history of keeping up with inflation. In the US, companies that provide dividends usually perform better during times of high inflation and increasing interest rates compared to non-dividend payers. Additionally, they're often seen as safer choices, declining less than the overall market during downturns. This defensive quality is especially significant in the current unpredictable circumstances. Since 1926, dividends have represented nearly one-third of the stock market’s overall returns.Dividend stocks experienced a slight drop this year as other asset classes began to catch the interest of investors. This doesn't mean that dividend stocks have lost their appeal, as their demand remains steady regardless of the economic situation. In one of our previous articles on dividend investing we cited data from Fidelity Investments, which mentioned that dividends made over half of the market's gains in high inflationary periods. The study also highlighted specific periods, like the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, where dividends accounted for 67%, 44%, and 73% of market gains, respectively. These decades saw inflation averaging above 5%, and overall returns were less than 10%.Also read: Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 12 Stock PicksEarlier this year, David Kostin, a Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist, gave an optimistic view regarding dividend stocks. He expects a 5% increase in dividend payments from S&amp;P 500 companies this year, with the potential for further growth. Here are some comments from the analyst:""We expect that S&amp;P 500 DPS [dividend-per-share] will reach $70 in 2023 and $73 (+4%) in 2024. Recent company actions also point to a healthy dividend growth environment. The difference in outlooks for dividend and buyback growth suggests firms focusing on dividends will continue to outperform buyback stocks.""Story continuesHe further mentioned that investors often consider companies that have long dividend growth histories because such companies are often financially sound, with the ability to generate sustained profits. By continuously boosting dividends, these companies prioritize providing returns to their shareholders, appealing to those seeking stable income and potential capital appreciation.In this article, we will discuss the top dividend stocks in Goldman Sachs's portfolio.

If you want to skip our introduction to perhaps the best known investor of our time, then head on over to 5 Smallest Stocks In Warren Buffett's Portfolio. Warren Buffett is the most successful hedge fund investor of our time. While his firm Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A) is not structured as a hedge fund, meaning that it does not use leverage to make risky investments for massive profits, Mr. Buffett's investment portfolio filed every quarter with the SEC still generates hype like the filings of major hedge funds do. After all, even though their investment strategies might be different, both Berkshire Hathaway and hedge funds rely on share price appreciations to grow their investments in value. However, unlike hedge funds, which often use a variety of trading strategies such as long, short, buying distressed debt, and small cap investing, Mr. Buffett's firm simply pays extremely close attention to companies before it invests in them and then holds the shares for years to let the profits accrue.Its success on the investing front has also made Mr. Buffett the most successful investor of our time. Our research covering the 20 Highest Paid Hedge Fund Managers of All Time shows that the top three fund managers have cumulatively made $176.2 billion in their time spent on the market and out of this, 65% of the compensation belongs to Mr. Buffett. Currently, the well known Oracle of Omaha is worth $118 billion, and is one of the richest people in the world.Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio is worth $348 billion as of June 2023 based on its SEC filings. This marks a $23 billion growth over the first quarter of 2023, and a more sizeable $55 billion annual growth. Seems like not only have Mr. Buffett's investments continued to grow on the stock market even as the market is quite turbulent, but he might also be getting more money for investing.Story continuesUnlike hedge funds, which post periodic returns and make payouts to investors, Berkshire Hathaway earns its profits from the dividends of the firms that it has invested in. Getting dividends, and reinvesting them, is one of Warren Buffett's favorite strategies and it fits in with his love of compounding which he discovered in his childhood. His decades spent on the stock market have seen him invest in some of the most popular, successful, and biggest companies in the world. As of Q2 2023, some of these firms in Warren Buffett's portfolio are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Bank of America Corporation (NASDAQ:BAC). If you want to find out more about Mr. Buffett's longest held investments, then take a look at Warren Buffett’s 12 Longest Held Stocks.The second quarter of 2023 hedge fund filing season is a crucial one since it shows what the funds might be thinking as interest rates touch record levels and the economy might be heading towards a recession. One sector that has caused some concern among investors is the real estate sector. This sector is one of the most sensitive to interest rate hikes, and the commercial office real estate sector in particular is quite jittery these days. Yet, it seems like Mr. Buffett might be long on the home building sector. He bought three new stocks during the second quarter, which are NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI). All these stocks are up in double digit percentages year to date, but it looks like Mr. Buffett believes there might be more steam left in this rally.With Warren Buffett's latest investment portfolio out, we decided to take a look at the smallest stocks in his portfolio in terms of market capitalization, with the notable picks being StoneCo Ltd.

If you want to skip our introduction to perhaps the best known investor of our time, then head on over to 5 Smallest Stocks In Warren Buffett's Portfolio. Warren Buffett is the most successful hedge fund investor of our time. While his firm Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A) is not structured as a hedge fund, meaning that it does not use leverage to make risky investments for massive profits, Mr. Buffett's investment portfolio filed every quarter with the SEC still generates hype like the filings of major hedge funds do. After all, even though their investment strategies might be different, both Berkshire Hathaway and hedge funds rely on share price appreciations to grow their investments in value. However, unlike hedge funds, which often use a variety of trading strategies such as long, short, buying distressed debt, and small cap investing, Mr. Buffett's firm simply pays extremely close attention to companies before it invests in them and then holds the shares for years to let the profits accrue.Its success on the investing front has also made Mr. Buffett the most successful investor of our time. Our research covering the 20 Highest Paid Hedge Fund Managers of All Time shows that the top three fund managers have cumulatively made $176.2 billion in their time spent on the market and out of this, 65% of the compensation belongs to Mr. Buffett. Currently, the well known Oracle of Omaha is worth $118 billion, and is one of the richest people in the world.Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio is worth $348 billion as of June 2023 based on its SEC filings. This marks a $23 billion growth over the first quarter of 2023, and a more sizeable $55 billion annual growth. Seems like not only have Mr. Buffett's investments continued to grow on the stock market even as the market is quite turbulent, but he might also be getting more money for investing.Story continuesUnlike hedge funds, which post periodic returns and make payouts to investors, Berkshire Hathaway earns its profits from the dividends of the firms that it has invested in. Getting dividends, and reinvesting them, is one of Warren Buffett's favorite strategies and it fits in with his love of compounding which he discovered in his childhood. His decades spent on the stock market have seen him invest in some of the most popular, successful, and biggest companies in the world. As of Q2 2023, some of these firms in Warren Buffett's portfolio are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Bank of America Corporation (NASDAQ:BAC). If you want to find out more about Mr. Buffett's longest held investments, then take a look at Warren Buffett’s 12 Longest Held Stocks.The second quarter of 2023 hedge fund filing season is a crucial one since it shows what the funds might be thinking as interest rates touch record levels and the economy might be heading towards a recession. One sector that has caused some concern among investors is the real estate sector. This sector is one of the most sensitive to interest rate hikes, and the commercial office real estate sector in particular is quite jittery these days. Yet, it seems like Mr. Buffett might be long on the home building sector. He bought three new stocks during the second quarter, which are NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI). All these stocks are up in double digit percentages year to date, but it looks like Mr. Buffett believes there might be more steam left in this rally.With Warren Buffett's latest investment portfolio out, we decided to take a look at the smallest stocks in his portfolio in terms of market capitalization, with the notable picks being StoneCo Ltd. (NASDAQ:STNE), Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX), and Liberty Latin America Ltd. (NASDAQ:LILA).15 Smallest Stocks In Warren Buffett's PortfolioOur Methodology To compile our list of Warren Buffett's smallest stocks, we took a look at his second quarter of 2023 investment portfolio courtesy of SEC filings.

The $60+ million project expands and replaces much of the current St. Joseph Technology Center. This is the first of a three phase plan to redesign an iconic research and development facility that has been home to decades of appliance innovations.Whirlpool Corporation's St. Joseph Technology Center (SJTC)""In 1911, the first electric washing machines were built here in St. Joseph, Michigan, and we continue to grow that legacy with the investment in this new, state-of-the-art technology center,"" said Marc Bitzer, Whirlpool chairman and CEO. ""We are committed to this community, and to improving life at home for families around the world. This new technology hub helps enable both of these promises by creating a new space where future innovation will come to life.""The expanded St. Joseph Technology Center is LEED Silver certified, a globally recognized ranking of sustainability achievement and leadership. The work that is done in this new facility will be focused on delivering great consumer solutions through the washers, dryers, dishwashers, and small appliance products designed and tested here including the iconic KitchenAid Stand Mixer. The facility employs more than 500 technicians, engineers, designers and adjacent roles, and contains 21 testing labs.""This $60 million investment by Whirlpool builds on the company's longstanding commitment to Southwest Michigan,"" said Gov. Whitmer. ""This transformative project will help Whirlpool attract top talent, put more people on paths to good-paying, high-skill jobs, and continue our mission to help anyone 'make it' in Michigan. Our unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in 23 years, we are moving forward on housing and community revitalization projects across the state, and we just delivered a bipartisan budget to lower costs, expand workforce programs, and power economic development. We look forward to continuing our work together to build a bright future.""Story continuesWhirlpool Corporation has invested more than $230 million in new or expanded facilities in the St. Joseph and Benton Harbor communities in the last ten years. The corporation also invested an additional $23 million in the 80-unit Emma Jean Hull Flats housing development in Benton Harbor which opened in June.""This new building offers state-of-the-art technology for product design, development and testing to help address consumer needs now and for the future,"" said Pam Klyn, Whirlpool executive vice president of corporate relations and sustainability. ""The appliances designed within the four walls of this new technology center will represent new levels of innovation and sustainability so consumers can feel confident they are making the right choice for their lifestyle and the environment.""Whirlpool Corp. products have continuously improved water and energy efficiency while increasing performance benefits to consumers for decades. The average clothes washers built today use nearly 78% less energy than those built in 1992, while their capacity has increased by 60%. In addition, most dishwashers developed by the company are already 3 to 4 times more water-efficient than hand washing - with the potential to save over 2,500 gallons of water per home each year.As employees begin to transition to the new building, work will continue into 2024 to complete the next phases of the St. Joseph Technology Center project including renovation of the facade of the remaining portion and increased parking to improve access for employees.About Whirlpool CorporationWhirlpool Corporation (NYSE: WHR) is committed to being the best global kitchen and laundry company, in constant pursuit of improving life at home.

243,0202c15c-d94e-3a5f-a584-35a4f9b89d21,SRE,2023-08-19,Sempra Expects Significant Growth Ahead for Energy Infrastructure and Announced Stock Split,Exec Edge,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sempra-expects-significant-growth-ahead-131445403.html,1692364485,STORY,['SRE'],"[Sempra Vice President of Investor Relations Glen DonovanBy Exec Edge EditorialSempra (NYSE:SRE), a leading North America energy infrastructure company, recently announced strong second quarter results and a two-for-one stock split – giving greater accessibility to invest in the company amid a mounting need for more modernized energy infrastructure to meet the growing demand for cleaner energy.We spoke to Glen Donovan, vice president of investor relations at Sempra, about the latest earnings report, the two-for-one stock split and the energy demands in its key utility service territories of California and Texas.Q: Just a few weeks ago, Sempra reported increased earnings compared to the same quarter last year. Why did Sempra’s Board of Directors choose to declare a two-for-one stock split? Thank you for speaking with me today. Sempra is celebrating 25 years in business, but our history actually goes back to the 1800s. Our companies have evolved a lot over the years to cater to the increasing need to power new communities and markets, and right now those trends include electrification, the adoption of more electric vehicles, and the increased government support for infrastructure investments. Through all of this change, our vision has remained the same: To deliver energy with purpose. I think I can speak for our employees across North America when I say that we are united by our commitment to serving others, including our investors.The Board’s decision to declare a two-for-one stock split means our company is now more accessible to more people. Since our formation in 1998, this is Sempra’s first stock split and our shares have increased from $25 to its current price of over $140 per share which has created considerable value for shareholders. We have experienced substantial momentum in our business and believe there are exciting opportunities for additional share price appreciation. The split makes sense by improving overall trading volume and liquidity and increasing accessibility. We’re proud of our achievements and welcome new investors to join our mission to be North America’s premier energy infrastructure company.Story continuesQ: This is an opportune time for Sempra given the positive outlook for grid investments in one of your key markets, California. California Independent System Operator’s (CAISO) recently released 2022-2023 transmission plan calling for new infrastructure investments. Tell us about the CAISO plan and Sempra’s opportunity to meet the state’s demands. In many respects, the investments needed to modernize our grid is an opportunity for significant rate base growth at Sempra. Earlier this year, California’s Independent System Operator awarded Sempra’s San Diego Gas &amp; Electric an estimated $500 million of planned transmission projects. Another $2.3 billion worth of projects within our service territory is up for competitive bidding.As you know, SDG&amp;E has a track record of success with more than 1,800 miles of transmission lines that are proactively monitored and modernized for improved safety and reliability. In addition, SDG&amp;E’s narrower focus on energy delivery and connecting producers of cleaner energy to customers directly supports the transition to a lower carbon energy system. Our talented and experienced team at Sempra California stands ready to support the state’s ambitious 2045 net-zero goals.Q: Sempra has a diverse geographic footprint, it not only serves California, but also Texas – which is expected to grow by nearly five million people by 2030. Tell us about the economic opportunity available to Sempra in Texas. When we acquired 80% of Oncor, the largest energy delivery company in Texas, five years ago, it had $11 billion of rate base, and Sempra made a regulatory commitment to support a minimum $7.4 billion 5-year capital plan. That same commitment grew to be nearly $12 billion of capital investment over that same period, and Oncor nearly doubled its rate base to $21 billion as of the end of 2022. Over the past five years Texas has shown very favorable demographic trends and Oncor’s system has grown substantially to meet the growing demands for electricity, having added approximately 7,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines.We have long talked about the incredible macroeconomic growth in Texas and how it continues to drive additional capital investments, but here’s the reality: the demand is anticipated only to increase, and policymakers realize that. The state legislative session this year ended with the enactment of several energy measures to strengthen grid resiliency and facilitate investment in new energy infrastructure to meet the growing Texas population. This year, Oncor increased its 2023 to 2027 capital plan to approximately $19 billion. With continued strong economic growth and the recent positive legislation, we now anticipate additional upside when we roll forward the new 5-year capital plan.These legislative outcomes are expected to enhance Oncor’s ability to better serve current customers and welcome new customers.Q: Electrification is the focus worldwide as leaders rapidly work to reach net-zero. Tell us about the work Sempra is doing across its family of companies to support electrification. Sempra has long worked to stay ahead of the curve by investing in modern energy networks, connecting more renewables to the grid and pioneering smart grid technologies to advance reliability and safety. Our companies have been working aggressively to expand cleaner transportation infrastructure, including electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, across the communities we serve. For example, SDG&amp;E has built 3,600 chargers. The utility is also piloting vehicle-to-grid technology (V2G) to connect electric school buses to 60kW bi-directional DC fast chargers. The goal is to help improve grid reliability and resiliency and reduce customers’ energy costs while also increasing adoption of zero-emissions transportation.Over at Oncor, the company collaborated with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to examine the opportunity for near-term electrification of heavy-duty trucks, or semi-trucks with a gross vehicle weight greater than 26,000 pounds. The team found that most (~80%) of the substations studied could supply the time-varying loads of 100 trucks charged at 100 kW/vehicle without any upgrades, and an additional 10% of substations could avoid upgrades if fleets used “smart” charging. As technologies that enable heavy-duty fleet electrification become available, studies like this can help anticipate and support the transition to cleaner transportation.We have been on a sustained path to decarbonize our business operations and the markets we serve for two decades now. We’re excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us to modernize and expand our energy networks so we can deliver increasingly cleaner, affordable and reliable energy to customers. We are proud of our progress and our ability to consistently deliver results to our investors.This press release contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Analysts call selloff 'nonsensical',Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cvs-stock-tumbles-after-blue-shield-of-california-shake-up-analysts-call-selloff-nonsensical-174803514.html,1692380883,STORY,"['CVS', 'WBA', 'CI', 'AMZN', 'NONOF', 'NVO', 'MCK', 'UNH', 'LLY', 'CAH']","[The shake-up in pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) services announced by Blue Shield of California on Thursday sent a number of healthcare stocks tumbling.CVS (CVS) and Cigna (CI), which hold the lion's share of Blues PBM contracts along with UnitedHealthcare (UNH), lost $7 billion and $5 billion in market cap on Thursday, respectively. Shares of drug distributors like McKesson (MCK), AmerisourceBergen (ABC), and Cardinal Health (CAH) each fell more than 2%.But analysts say the reality of the announcement is less severe than the market's initial reaction suggested.""Thursday was a unique 'perfect storm' of news that likely had a bigger impact on sentiment than it will in setting precedent,"" wrote UBS analyst Kevin Caliendo in a note, adding the selloff Thursday was ""nonsensical.""The Blues insurer, which is responsible for about 5 million members in California and posts $24 billion in annual revenue, is unbundling its PBM service and doling out portions to disruptors like Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs and Amazon Pharmacy (AMZN).The move, according to Blue Shield, will save $500 million on medications annually— a number CEO Paul Markovich told Yahoo Finance he is confident will be achieved.""We're creating a different mouse trap here. We've done the math,"" Markovich said.Under the new arrangement, Cost Plus Drugs will be responsible for generics and Amazon will take on the mail order business. Puerto Rico-based Abarca Health will manage claims and Prime Therapeutics, a PBM jointly owned by 19 Blues plans which works with partners like Walgreens (WBA) and Cigna's Express Scripts, will handle drug pricing negotiations.The shift will take effect starting in 2024 when Blue Shield's contract with CVS, which has been in place since 2021, ends.However, CVS will maintain the most profitable segment: specialty pharmacy. That, according to analysts, is the reason the announcement isn't all doom and gloom for the Big 3 PBMs — CVS, Cigna, and United Health Group.Story continues""[The] spectre of AMZN will likely negatively impact sentiment for the group, again,"" JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill wrote in a note on Thursday. ""However, we think the announcement actually highlights the value of legacy PBMs and limitations of newer models as Blue Shield is keeping the fastest growing and largest portion of its drug spend with CVS.""Gill noted that generics typically represent only 15% of drug spend even though they represent a higher volume of spend, and specialty drugs continue to rise in cost and represent a pain point for large employers, as seen during the recent demand surge for branded weight loss drugs like Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy and Ozempic, and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Mounjaro.""Per Cost Plus's page, the company has over 1,000 generic medications available but almost no branded drugs. Although the company seeks to add more branded drugs, it appears to be focusing only on specialty drugs that can be delivered via mail order,"" Gill said.In addition, mail order prescriptions have not taken over in-person pickups, despite a surge seen during the pandemic, so there is little concern about Amazon's share of the new arrangement, analysts said.Some are concerned about the customer experience with the complex makeup of PBMs.""Coordinating five vendors is like an average Tuesday for us,"" Markovich said.He added that despite the criticism, Blue Shield is going to be sticking to the unbundled model long-term, even though it is likely the combination of players changes in the future.A sign marks a CVS branch on May 16 in Pasadena, Calif. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)'Hard to replicate'The announcement from California Blue Shield on Thursday also isn't the first time an insurer has tried such a move.""Health plans have a mixed track record of separating or in-sourcing PBM functions,"" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note Friday. ""This decision by a large health plan will keep scrutiny on PBM economics and attention on proposed legislative changes, though we see the stock reactions as disproportionate relative to the likely implications.""""Historically, the value of scale offered by the Big 3 PBMs has been difficult to replicate,"" the firm added.Craig Garthwaite, a health economist and director of the Program on Healthcare at the Kellogg School at Northwestern University, told Yahoo Finance he's willing to bet the savings California Blue Shield ends up seeing isn't actually $500 million.""There's got to be a belief (by Blue Shield) that there's $500 million per year in excessive, unwarranted profit that the PBM is taking. I just don't believe that's true,"" Garthwaite said.The fact that CVS has been able to keep the profitable specialty pharmacy business also bolsters the unpopular opinion that the Big 3 serve a purpose. Garthwaite said this move runs counter to the idea that ""PBM executives are these monopolous fat cats lighting cigars with hundred dollar bills. It's not that. They actually do things that matter to people.""He also noted that CVS could respond by increasing the cost of the business segment it is keeping in the new contract with Blue Shield.Markovich said anything is possible, but the contracts are in place and renegotiating them could be a breach.The plan has been in the works for more than two years, with a lengthy request for proposal process, which began just before the pandemic, he said.The announcement has excited watchers of health care industry trends, who anticipate other Blues and employer plans could emulate the strategy.""Almost every investor we spoke with felt the consortium hired by Blue Shield was risky at best to be able to execute on the new business,"" UBS's Caliendo wrote. ""We tend to agree, but also understand that this thesis is not likely to be proven anytime soon given timing on onboarding.""We do think the idea that PBM contracting will be increasingly 'unbundled'...perhaps leading to lower overall profits from purchasing, rebates, and couponing.""Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The contract is likely to be effective from Jul 1, 2024.The new contract will allow UnitedHealth Group to extend health care coverage and serve the diversified needs of New Mexico residents, who are members of the state’s Medicaid managed care program (Turquoise Care). It will also enable UNH to deepen its presence across states with a significant number of Medicaid enrollees. Apart from UNH, other managed care organizations were recently chosen by the New Mexico HSD to award Turquoise Care Medicaid contracts, which include BlueCross BlueShield, Presbyterian Health Plan and Molina’s New Mexico health plan.Inevitably, contract wins boost the customer base and fetch health insurers with higher premiums, which remain the most significant contributors to their top line. The medical membership of UnitedHealth Group grew 3.1% year over year as of Jun 30, 2023. Besides, its Medicaid membership witnessed a year-over-year increase of 4.6% at the same time.The strength of its Medicaid business has fetched numerous contract wins from time to time. In March 2023, the company won a contract from the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration. This was another commendable opportunity for UnitedHealth Group to penetrate a geography which serves around 100,000 Medicaid LTSS members. Contract wins like these are expected to help UnitedHealth Group achieve its 2023 revenue guidance in the range of $357-$360 billion.UnitedHealth Group served as a Medicaid administrator in Mexico from 2013 to 2018, which makes it an experienced candidate to support the health of New Mexicans. Currently, UNH has 210,000 plus members enrolled in individual, employer-sponsored and Medicare plans in New Mexico. It also has a network of 11,000 physicians and 49 hospitals in the state.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceUNH currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Shares of UnitedHealth Group have lost 6.8% year to date compared with the industry’s 5.2% decline.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini.Laraine A. ManciniHello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all organic net sales growth also excludes the noncomparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures and the impact of foreign currency translation. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through brand.com sites and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of products through our retailers' websites. (Operator Instructions) And now, I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.Story continuesFabrizio FredaThank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our fiscal year 2023 results and outlook. Let me begin with the fourth quarter. We delivered an organic sales increase of 4%, achieving a return to growth for the quarter as expected. Momentum continued in the markets of EMEA and Latin America and accelerated in Asia Pacific, where organic sales growth improved from 7% in the third quarter to 36% in the fourth quarter, led by Mainland China and Hong Kong SAR. Looking at the full year, while demand for our business is still strong, with retail sales growth up mid-single digit globally, organic sales declined 6%. We delivered impressive double-digit growth in the markets of EMEA and return to growth in Asia Pacific, while the Americas held steady. These gains across the markets of EMEA and Asia Pacific were more than offset by Asia travel retail, given the prolonged and complex recovery from the pandemic, as we have discussed in our previous earning calls. Indeed, our global travel retail business decreased 34% organically in fiscal year 2023, solely driven by Asia travel retail. Our travel retail business in EMEA and the Americas soared, and our investment in activation and in-store Beauty Advisor drove strong performance as passenger traffic increased. The rest of our business in total rose 5% organically as growth accelerated from 10% in the third quarter to 17% in the fourth quarter. The challenges in Asia travel retail disproportionately pressured Skin Care, which is our highest margins category. Compounding matters, the leverage was pronounced as the lower level of sales coincided with elevated strategic investment in manufacturing and R&amp;D capabilities as well as information technology for our online business, and to support our expanding supply chain globally. All told, our adjusted operating margin contracted meaningfully in fiscal year 2023 to 11.4%, modestly better than we expected in the revised outlook we offered in May. During fiscal year 2023, we continue to make progress on our sustainability goals and commitments. For our packaging goals, for instance, we have now advanced from 51% of our packaging being recyclable, refillable, reusable, recycled or recoverable in fiscal year '19 to over 70% in fiscal year 2023. As well, we are on track to maintain our status of 100% renewable electricity and Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon neutrality. We are proud to have been recognized by CDP for our continued commitment to disclose our environmental impact as reflected in our CDP climate, water and forest disclosure scores for 2022. Most notably, we achieved an A- for our climate change disclosures and we earned a place in the prestigious A List for water, improving our score over 2021. Looking ahead, for Asia travel retail, the pressure in Hainan intensified over the course of the fourth quarter. In May and June, retail sales trends deteriorated and turned steeply negative, following the enforcement actions to control Daigou activity. The implication of these are favorable for sustainable long-term growth, but certainly create significant short-term headwinds through the transition. As we embark on fiscal year 2024, we have 4 strategic imperatives: drive momentum where our business is thriving, reaccelerate growth in the United States, capture demand for the returning individual traveler in Asia travel retail and begin to rebuild our profitability. For fiscal year 2024, we expect to return to full year organic sales growth and margin expansion, with organic sales rising 6% to 8% and adjusted operating margin improving sequentially throughout the year. Our fiscal year 2024 action plan, where we expect to again increase our investment in advertising as a percentage of sales, will also set the stage for a stronger fiscal year 2025 acceleration. One of our greatest strengths to leverage in our return to top and bottom line growth is our diverse portfolio of nearly 25 brands. Sitting at the top are our $4 billion-plus brands of Clinique, Estee Lauder, La Mer and M·A·C, each a winner in its own right. M·A·C, the world's biggest prestige makeup brand, was our best-performing brand across the entire portfolio in fiscal year 2023. It's unrivaled artistry, hero product, strong media value ranking and breakthrough innovation of the Hyper Real franchise in Skin Care drove excellent results. For fiscal year 2024, the brand is on the cusp of the big launch in makeup as M·A·C aims to extend its winning streak in innovation. Indeed, all our billion-dollar plus brands have exciting newness ahead in both product and commercial innovation as they leverage their brand equity, scale and omnichannel beauty advisers. Clinique, the #1 prestige skin care brand in the U.S., pioneered dermatologist-developed products when it was founded in 1968. The brand is deepening its connections with dermatologists, adding powerful, instant and dermatologist-level claims, doubling down in its unique safety philosophy and activating more derm education on TikTok. And later this month, Clinique will elevate its equity in the aging with a breakthrough launch of Smart Clinical Repair lifting face and neck cream, a new dermatologist-tested formula. Estee Lauder, among the biggest prestige brands globally, is extending its world-renowned Advanced Night Repair franchise with the launch of Rescue Solution for sensitive skin, and the brand's luxury oriented Re-Nutriv franchise has a rich innovation program across Makeup and Skin Care. La Mer, the global leader in luxury skin care grew, double digits in Asia Pacific in fiscal year 2023 and aims to accelerate its growth with the upcoming launch of the Lifting and Firming Serum. This launch capitalizes on La Mer's successfully upgraded moisturizer soft cream as both bring advanced benefit in anti-aging efficacy. Moreover, La Mer is introducing new regimens focused on the power of its iconic Miracle Broth to capitalize on the trend of night regimens. In fiscal year 2024, this esteemed tier of $1 billion-plus brands is set to expand its breadth count by 50% as we expect Jo Malone London and TOM FORD to cross the sales threshold. These 2 brands have excelled over the last decade and are ideally positioned for the next decade, given their positioning in the fast-growing segment of luxury and artisanal fragrance. For TOM FORD, which epitomized luxury glamor, fiscal year 2023 was momentum. We are thrilled to have acquired the brand after having collaborated to create TOM FORD for over 15 years. This acquisition is a central building block to realize our aspirations in high-growth luxury (inaudible) beauty. Moreover, the brand sales rose strong double digits organically in Fragrance for the fiscal year. The breadth of this performance was stunning as over 30 markets grew double digits. The strength of its hero products and innovation proven a powerful combination with new and existing consumers. And Tom Ford enticing Café Rose launched to begin fiscal year 2024. In makeup, TOM FORD delivered double-digit organic sales growth in Asia Pacific and the markets in EMEA, driven by excellent performance in Lips.Among our other scaling brands, or those with sales between $500 million and $1 billion, we are encouraged by their progress in fiscal year 2023. For Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, the brand continued to complement its expanding makeup business with strong growth in skin care, while Aveda executed on its global ambition with the successful launch in Mainland China. The Ordinary graduated into our tier scale brands as double-digit sales growth propelled it well above $500 million. The brand's list of achievements for the year is long indeed, from success in its hero product to a step change in the contribution to sales from innovation to doubling its TikTok followers to strong share gains in prestige skin care in the U.S. and Western Europe. The Ordinary proved its high-performance, ingredient-led products are well loved, and we believe it is just getting started in realizing its global potential. Looking across our developing brands, in which we strategically invest to realize the scaling brands of the future, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Editions de Parfums Frederic Malle each achieved double-digit organic sales growth in fiscal year 2023 to continue their winning streaks. Impressively, over the last 5 years, these 3 brands have delivered over 30% compound annual growth, demonstrating brand-building acumen. At this time next year, we will be on the verge of launching BALMAIN BEAUTY, with the namesake luxury fashion house. Our collaboration with BALMAIN has been exceptional, and we cannot wait to introduce this new luxury beauty brand to the world. For our brand portfolio, we have positioned ourselves to take advantage of the efficiency and the effectiveness that will be enabled by generative AI. Furthermore, creating high-quality, high-performing products is in our DNA. Innovation has long served as a catalyst for growth. It once again represented over 25% of our sales in fiscal year 2023. We have a rich pipeline of newness 2146 slated for fiscal year 2024, and it gets even bigger and stronger in fiscal year 2025 with more breakthrough innovation and expansion into white space opportunities. Over the last few years, aligned with our innovation strategy, we have significantly increased the breadth, depth and diversity of our clinical studies for new and legacy products across categories to deliver impactful claims. This work, combined with our newly opened China innovation labs in Shanghai, equips us with even greater capabilities to drive growth with consumers locally and around the world. For Skin Care, we have also significantly increased our scientific credential, demonstrated by an 85% increase in scientific advisory Board members and third-party dermatologists and academic partners in the last 2 years. Last month, at the World Congress of Dermatology in Singapore, we presented several studies for Clinique, Estee Lauder and La Mer. This was a milestone moment for Estee Lauder's Re-Nutriv franchise as our scientists unveiled our newness breakthrough longevity age reversal research on a global stage. Re-Nutriv has been and continue to be a pioneer in this frontier of skin biology, and we'll extend upon the recent success of Ultimate Diamond Transformative Brilliance Serum with compelling innovation this fiscal year. As we rebuild the challenges of fiscal year 2023, we expect to leverage and stand upon these trends as we drive resilient growth. The opportunity ahead of us is significant, as over 900 million people are expected to enter the middle class to 2030 and drive consumption as they seek the high-quality, strong efficacy and joy that prestige beauty affords. Our company has great confidence in the long-term development of China, and we are proud of the very strong business we have built, led by our exceptional local team. The Chinese consumers continue to be the unrivaled #1 growth drivers of our industry throughout the decade. We are pleased to have returned to organic sales growth in Mainland China this fiscal year 2023 and to have expanded our prestige beauty share as the market gradually evolves in its recovery from the pandemic. Impressively, Mainland China's fourth quarter organic sales were up double digit compared to both 1 and 2 years ago, and we further expanded our prestige beauty share in the quarter. We made significant long-term investment in the market across fiscal year 2023. Beyond the opening of the China innovation lab in Shanghai and a new distribution center in Guangzhou, we launched Aveda to start the year and Le Labo to end the year. Aveda quickly captured up the ranks of prestige hair care, driven in part by its focus on the skinification of hair and high-performance product for scalp care. Le Labo initial freestanding store in Shanghai redefines experiential shopping, which makes it no surprise that it was the brand's top performing store in the world in the month of June. We also invested in the vibrant opportunity in both brick-and-mortar and online, opening in 7 new cities, expanding our online reach with Douyin and creating exceptional live streaming content which, as you know, is a game changer to excel in the market. Our online ecosystem continues to move from strength to strength across social and commerce, encompassing Tmall, JD, WeChat, Red and Douyin among others, driving our share gains for the fiscal quarter and year. Online in Mainland China performed exceptionally well every month in the fourth quarter to realize over 60% organic sales growth and expand online prestige beauty share by 2 points, owning to innovation, gifting campaigns and excellent execution. We capped the quarter success on 618 where our brand strength was broad-based. Estee Lauder ranked #1 in store live streaming prestige beauty on both Tmall and Douyin, La Mer ranked the #1 in luxe beauty on Tmall for the third consecutive year, and Jo Malone London took the top spot on Tmall and JD for luxe fragrances. From an organizational standpoint, Mainland China and China travel retail have enhanced their capabilities for local coordination of go-to-market strategies and plans to maximize long-term value and support brand equity. The expected growth of the middle class around the world is exciting implication of our business, given also our vibrant emerging market portfolio. Indeed, in fiscal year 2023, our emerging markets delivered organic sales growth of 20% led by India, Brazil, Turkey and Thailand. India grew nearly 50% for the year, driven by excellent performance by our long-standing brands in the market and the very successful launch of The Ordinary. In North America, we are focused on reaccelerating growth to better capture prestige beauty opportunities in the region. Our multi-facet strategy plan includes launching a robust innovation pipeline, increasing engagement by brands on TikTok, accentuating our strength in luxury and artisanal fragrance and high-performance, ingredient-led skin care, and expand the brand reach in specialty-multi among other initiatives. And we are excited to extend our reach online as The Ordinary and Estee Lauder are soon to launch on TikTok Shop. Let me now turn to our profitability. We have identified 4 building blocks to progressively expand adjusted operating margin over the next few years. First, we are focused on optimizing mix by elevating luxury across brands, driven by consumer preferences, by expanding our direct-to-consumer ecosystem across brick-and-mortar and online. Second, we see many opportunities to maximize value through better price realization and accretive innovation. Third, we intend to increasingly leverage the strategic investment we have made over the last few years, most notably our new manufacturing facility in Japan and expanded online capabilities. Last, we believe we can unlock meaningful cost efficiencies in our value chain as we complete the rollout and adoption of our new integrated business planning process across the global operation and use generative AI to drive efficiencies. In closing, while we had a challenging year, we remain confident in our long-term strategy to realize the promising growth opportunity in global prestige beauty with our diversified portfolio brands, robust research development capability and global reach. We are encouraged by the fundamental strength of our business in the markets of EMEA, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and are focused on our plans to recover growth in Asia travel retail and North America. For fiscal year 2024, we believe we are well positioned to return to organic sales growth and improve profitability. To our employees, you are the heart and the soul of our beautiful company, and I extend my deepest gratitude to your exceptional contribution and dedication. And now, I will turn the call over to Tracey.Tracey Thomas TravisThank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. While we certainly had many successes this past fiscal year, as you just heard, we are not satisfied with our fiscal 2023 financial results and are executing on our strategy to progressively rebuild the margin accretive areas of our business over the next few years, and leverage the investments we have made in manufacturing, distribution and technology capabilities. I will further address our plans when I discuss our fiscal 2024 outlook, but first, I will cover the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter and full year results. Our fourth quarter organic net sales increased 4% and earnings per share was $0.07. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales grew in nearly all markets in both Asia Pacific and EMEA. This strong performance was partially offset by the ongoing challenges in our Asia travel retail business as we expected. Organic net sales in Asia Pacific rose 36%, reflecting double-digit growth in most markets, led by Mainland China and Hong Kong SAR, as they continue to progress in recovery with fewer COVID-related restrictions compared to the prior year. They also benefited from our successful brand innovations, new product launches, activation consumer -- of consumers and targeted consumer reach. In Mainland China, online realized over 30% organic growth and achieved approximately 60% penetration of sales in the quarter. In EMEA, organic net sales decreased 15%. The growth in nearly all markets and channels of distribution was more than offset by the performance of our Asia travel retail business. In Hainan, retail sales declined more than we expected in the quarter for the reasons Fabrizio mentioned. Excluding our travel retail business, net sales in both Makeup and Fragrance rose double digits in the region, benefiting from our strategic investments in advertising and promotional activities and the reestablishment of services in our stores. Organic net sales in the Americas were flat compared to last year. The strong double-digit increase in Latin America driven by the re-acceleration of makeup growth in Brazil and Mexico, was offset by the decline in the United States due to the slower-than-expected pace of improvement in retail sales of several of our brands. Standout performance from The Ordinary continues to be a bright spot in the region for the many reasons that Fabrizio mentioned earlier. From a product category perspective, Makeup organic net sales increased 13%, reflecting growth in each region led by Asia Pacific as recovery continued and usage occasions increased. M·A·C, Estee Lauder and TOM FORD drove growth, benefiting from investments in brand activations and increases in in-store staffing, the continued success of hero products as well as new product launches. Fragrance organic net sales rose 12%, led by Le Labo and TOM FORD. Strong double-digit growth from Le Labo reflected increases in every region, momentum from our [City] exclusive special collection as well as growth from both existing and new points of distribution, including its expansion into Mainland China. The increase from TOM FORD was fueled by strategic investments in advertising and promotional activities to support key shopping moments and brand activations. Organic net sales increased 6% in Hair Care and declined 3% in Skin Care. The pressures in our Asia travel retail business drove the Skin Care decline and were largely offset by the exceptional growth in the Asia Pacific region. La Mer and Estee Lauder declined, while The Ordinary, Bobbi Brown and M·A·C grew. M·A·C's growth was driven by the launch of the Hyper Real line of skin care products. Our gross margin declined 330 basis points compared to last year. This decline primarily reflects the under-absorption of overhead in our plants due to the pull down of production throughout the year given our elevated inventory levels, as well as increased obsolescence charges. Operating expenses increased 70 basis points as a percent of sales, driven largely by the increase in advertising and promotional activities to support commercial activations in the quarter. Operating income declined 66% to $71 million, and our operating margin contracted 380 basis points to 2% in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was a negative 17.9% compared to 14.2% last year due to a true-up in the quarter to reflect the final effective tax rate for the fiscal 2023 full year. Diluted EPS of $0.07 decreased 82% compared to last year. The impact from foreign currency translation and foreign currency transactions in key travel retail locations negatively impacted EPS by 7% and 9%, respectively. As we discussed in May, we completed the acquisition of the TOM FORD brand and the related intellectual property on April 28, paying approximately $2.3 billion. As a result of this acquisition, we entered into arrangements to license the TOM FORD trademark for eyewear to Marcolin and Fashion to Zegna, which were the brand's prior licensees, creating a new revenue stream for the company. This acquisition had a dilutive impact to EPS of $0.01, including interest expense on our debt financing and reflecting savings from royalties we no longer have to pay. Shifting now to our full year results. This has certainly been a more volatile year than we anticipated. The challenges to our business in Asia travel retail and the United States as well as in the first half in Mainland China were partially offset by the progression of recovery everywhere else. In Mainland China, we continue to gain share in all major product categories, demonstrating the strong demand for our products, although we remain conscious of the evolving economic conditions. And overall, our investments in brand activations, increased in-store staffing, distribution expansion and online capabilities aided in the acceleration of recovery of sales which largely occurred in brick-and-mortar channels, excluding travel retail. Net sales growth was strong in brick-and-mortar, particularly in our freestanding stores and with our specialty multi-retailers. Global travel retail represented 20% of our reported sales in fiscal 2023. And online net sales, which were flat, represented 29% of our reported sales. Organic net sales fell 6%, primarily reflecting the challenges in our Asia travel retail business, which drove the declines in our EMEA region of 16% and in Skin Care of 14%. Nearly all other domestic markets in EMEA grew double digits. In Asia Pacific, net sales rose 4% as markets continue to progress in recovery throughout the year and benefited from investments in advertising and promotional activities, innovation and distribution expansion. Net sales in the Americas was flat compared to last year. Regarding categories, Fragrance net sales increased 14%, rising double digits in every geographic region and benefiting from the continued strength of hero products, successful innovation and distribution expansion, while Skin Care was more challenged in Asia travel retail and North America. Net sales grew 6% in Hair Care and was flat in Makeup. Our gross margin declined 440 basis points compared to last year, largely due to the slower-than-expected recovery in Asia travel retail. This includes higher obsolescence charges under-absorption of overhead in our plants due to the pull down of production throughout the year, given our higher inventory levels and less favorable category mix from our Skin Care mix. Operating expenses increased 390 basis points to 59.9% of sales, driven primarily by the decline in sales. Despite the pressures to sales, we sustained our investments to support markets where recovery was evident, including in areas such as advertising, promotion, innovation and selling, which collectively increased by 280 basis points as a percent of sales. Operating income declined 48% to $1.8 billion from $3.5 billion last year, and our operating margin contracted 830 basis points to 11.4% for the full year. In spite of the challenges that materially impacted our top line growth, we continued certain of our strategic investments important to support recovery and drive long-term sales growth and profitability. Our effective tax rate for the year was 26.5% compared to 21.3% last year, primarily reflecting the change in our geographical mix of earnings. Net sales declined 53% to $1.2 billion, and diluted EPS of $3.46 decreased 52% compared to last year, including the dilutive impacts from foreign currency translation and foreign currency transactions in key retail -- travel retail locations of 4% each. The acquisition of the TOM FORD brand was dilutive to EPS by $0.01. Now turning to our cash flows for the fiscal year. We generated $1.7 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $3 billion last year. The decrease reflects lower net income, partially offset by lower working capital. We invested $1 billion in capital expenditures for supply chain enhancements including our new manufacturing facility in Japan, consumer-facing capital such as distribution expansion, investments in existing counters and online capabilities. We returned $1.2 billion in cash to stockholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Beginning in December of 2022, we suspended the repurchase of shares given the increase in debt due to the TOM FORD acquisition. Before I turn to our outlook for the full year, I want to take a moment to first address the recent cybersecurity incident we disclosed in July, involving an unauthorized third-party that gained access to some of our systems. After becoming aware of the incident, we proactively took down some of our systems. We began bringing our systems back online within days, which limited the incidents impact on the company's operations. Based on the information available to date, we believe the incident is contained. So now, let's turn to our outlook. This past year has undoubtedly been difficult, largely given the challenges we faced from increased market volatility in certain markets and the corresponding impact on our business. As we work to return to net sales growth in fiscal 2024, and over the next few years, progressively rebuild our operating margin, we remain focused on the transition of key areas of our business that have been disproportionately impacted by a slower pace of recovery while also continuing to support growth in those areas where the recovery is more advanced. Over the next few years, Mainland China and our travel retail business are expected to remain key drivers of our long-term profitable growth, and we anticipate continued growth with other areas of our business, including emerging markets globally, our more mature markets in the West and our direct-to-consumer channels globally. Assuming an eventual return to global prestige growth of 4% to 5%, we expect to return to more consistent compounded annual sales growth within our 6% to 8% long-term growth algorithm. Restoration of our operating margin is a top priority, though margin recovery will not happen in 1 year. We do, however, expect to progressively drive margin expansion as we return to profitable growth in Skin Care, improved Makeup margins and continue to drive our momentum in Fragrance, particularly our high-end artisanal fragrance brands. In addition, we plan to expand our gross margins through continuing to leverage our prestige pricing power, inclusive of driving additional accretive and compelling innovation, and improvements in operational efficiencies including enhanced supply demand planning and inventory optimization to reduce excess inventory and discount. We will begin to leverage the further regionalization of our manufacturing and distribution network in Asia to create greater inventory agility as demand fluctuates. Overall, beginning in fiscal 2024, we expect to recapture lost operating margin -- overall -- I'm sorry, beyond fiscal 2024, we expect to recapture lost operating margin at an accelerated pace by delivering annual margin expansion that is faster than our pre-pandemic historical average. This acceleration is expected to become more evident after the first quarter of fiscal 2024. So turning to fiscal 2024. We expect to continue to deliver net sales gains in the areas that performed well in 2023, including Asia Pacific, our Western and emerging European markets and Latin America, as they continue to progress in recovery from the pandemic, and benefit from the strategic actions we are taking to accelerate growth, including targeted consumer activation, compelling innovation and distribution enhancements that we drove throughout the pandemic period. We are, however, mindful of the macroeconomic headwinds that have emerged in Chinese economy. This has also resulted in our Asia travel retail business taking a bit longer than we originally anticipated to return to growth as travel and conversion remain pressured, which has been exacerbated by the sudden reduction of sales to non-travelers relative to the return of individual travelers in Korea and in Hainan. Correspondingly, inventory levels in the trade in Asia travel retail have improved at a slower pace. This will create greater pressure on our first half as we expect to continue to both adjust our shipments and increase our retail activation, but also should yield sequential quarterly improvements throughout the year in both sales and margin. With that backdrop in mind, and using June 30 spot rates of 1.087 for the euro, 1.261 for the pound, 7.253 for the Chinese yuan and 13.21 for the Korean won, the full fiscal year organic net sales are forecasted to grow 6% to 8%. Royalty revenue from the acquisition of the TOM FORD brand is not expected to be material to net sales growth and will be excluded from organic net sales until the fourth quarter. The cybersecurity incident is also not expected to have a material impact to net sales. Currency translation is expected to dilute reported sales growth for the full fiscal year by 1 percentage point. We take the majority of our pricing actions at the beginning of our fiscal year. Our strategic price increases, including new products, are expected to add approximately 5 points of growth. We expect the net benefits from strategic pricing, discount reductions and lower obsolescence to drive gross margin expansion for the full year, partially offset by manufacturing under-absorption. We are aligning our production volumes to address a more variable demand environment with the intent to carry less inventory in our system and in the trade while we continue to regionalize our supply base in Asia. However, we expect the lower mix of net sales from the highly margin-accretive areas of our business, including Asia travel retail and Skin Care, and the under-absorption of overhead to result in margin contraction in the first half of the year. This is expected to be more than offset by gross margin expansion in the second half of the year, given the greater mix of our travel retail business and Skin Care and less obsolescence charges compared to last year. Our full year operating margin is forecasted to be approximately 12% to 12.5%, a 60 to 110 basis point expansion from fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2024, we anticipate sequential margin expansion throughout the year driven by improvements in gross margin, while also maintaining go-to-market initiatives where appropriate. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 27%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.50 and $3.75 before restructuring and other charges. The cybersecurity incident is expected to be approximately $0.07 dilutive to EPS. Our EPS range also includes approximately $0.11 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to grow by approximately 4% to 12%. Net cash flows from operating activities are forecasted between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately 6% of forecasted net sales as we expect to fund new distribution and online capabilities, further enhance our manufacturing and distribution network, including the completion of our first manufacturing facility in Asia located in Japan to support the development of our Asia Pacific region. We also plan to continue investing in information technology to support our business. Our fiscal 2024 outlook also assumes flat quarterly dividend and the continued suspension of our share repurchases as we focus on deleveraging after the TOM FORD acquisition and prepare for the payment to purchase the remaining outstanding equity interest in DECIEM anticipated in May of 2024. For our first quarter, we currently expect organic net sales to fall 12% to 10%. The cybersecurity incident is not expected to have a material impact to net sales. At this time, we expect first quarter diluted EPS of negative $0.31 to negative $0.21 before restructuring and other charges. The cybersecurity incident is expected to be approximately $0.07 dilutive to EPS. This also includes approximately $0.02 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS of negative $0.29 to negative $0.19. I would like to close by thanking our employees for their dedication and focus during what turned out to be a challenging year. While we are not satisfied with our performance overall, we are certainly pleased by the results we were able to deliver in many recovering markets and brands. For fiscal 2024, we believe we have the right plans to navigate the environment as we gradually return to our historical cadence of long-term progressive and sustainable sales and profit growth, fueled by our highly desirable brand portfolio and our incredibly talented employees. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.Question and Answer SessionOperatorThe floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank.Stephen Robert R. PowersI'd love it if you could address 2 topics, maybe 1 for you, Tracey, 1 for you, Fabrizio. First for Tracey, just -- appreciate your commentary at the end there, but just maybe a little bit more detail, if you could expand on the assumptions embedded in the 1Q step back and declines juxtaposed against what looks like a pretty rapid return to fairly -- to basically double-digit organic growth over the remainder of the year? Just little more color there, and I'm assuming a lot of the variability is focused on Hainan, so maybe some expansion there? And then Fabrizio, I know the company had a leadership offsite in June. I'd love your perspective on how recent changes in the operating environment impacted points of emphasis of that meeting? And how the related discussion may have informed your '24 outlook?Tracey Thomas TravisSteve. So I'll start with your question regarding the cadence of the year. And you're right, there is a lot of variability. If I would take you back to the first and second quarter of last year, you'll recall that while we had some disruption in Hainan, we did have -- we still had some business in Hainan. We also had business in Korea. So our travel retail percent of mix was higher in the first half of last year in addition to, obviously, the recovery that we were seeing in the EMEA and Americas regions in terms of the airports in those regions. In the second half of the year, then obviously, we saw the challenges that we've called out certainly in the last call as it relates to both Korea, and obviously, what Fabrizio talked about in the fourth quarter as it relates to Hainan. We have a bit of a reverse situation as we're anniversary-ing those impacts this year. So with what happened in the May, June time frame in Hainan, we are seeing less traffic and less conversion in Hainan than we saw previously. That is impacting our Q1 certainly compared to last year when we saw more traffic and more conversion in Hainan and in Korea. That gets a bit better in Q2, as we anniversary some of the softness that began to materialize in Q2 last year in those 2 areas. And then we're anniversary-ing, obviously, the softness that we experienced in the second half of our fiscal '23 in fiscal '24. So we are expecting that travel retail will get progressively better in the third and fourth quarter, certainly compared to the third and fourth quarter we had this year. Part of that, Steve, is obviously the destocking that we are doing. So in Hainan, obviously, with the sudden change in Daigou, that is making the retail traffic slower than what we had anticipated. And as a result of that, it's changing our view on the shipments that we will need for Hainan in the first quarter and certainly a bit into the second quarter. So I hope that helps in terms of some of the cadence of what we're experiencing and why the margin differential is so great. As you know, travel retail certainly benefits from a lot of the investment that we make in our markets like China and Korea and Japan, and all of the other markets not only in Asia, but in EMEA as well. And so it is a high margin -- higher margin channel for us for some of those reasons. Fabrizio?Fabrizio FredaYes, on our leadership. In June, we looked at the strategy and the strategy of the future. And so what Tracey and I have presented in our prepared remarks are the results of also this work of reconfirming the strategy for 2024 for the next 3 years. And so what are the key takeaways was your question. It's that, first of all, the market of global prestige beauty continue to be very attractive and will continue to be more and more attractive in the future. And our strategy is, as I explained in the prepared remarks, is now focused on continued building on our strengths and continue building the areas where we are really delivering great results and supporting this growth. At the same time, continue reinforcing the health of our brands and the innovation of our brands and refocusing resources and activities in all these areas. And then fix the TR issue, including a much better coordination between TR organization in China and China region organization in Mainland, and the plans for the North America acceleration. And to continue winning emerging markets. By the way, in the last quarter, we're astonishing with a 38% growth. And so deploying the resources, the capabilities, the skills to continue doing this in the key emerging markets. I have to say, the excitement in India is particularly high. And so in summary, the leadership of the company has agreed and allocated resources and skills on the key components of the strategy for the next 3 years, which is leverage the growth of the market. And obviously, continue to build our strengths, fix our issues, and most importantly, support the profit recovery plan that again, we explained in the prepared remarks, in every single aspect at accelerated pace of profit recovery, as Tracey just explained.OperatorThe next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.Dara Warren MohsenianSo 2-part question on my end that I think builds on that answer, Fabrizio. Some fairly unique circumstances in the past year, both externally and internally, that caused weaker results than you originally expected. That's uncharacteristic versus a longer-term track record. So just wanted to get your perspective on, A, if you think you have good visibility on this fiscal '24 earnings guidance? How much investment are you assuming incrementally to drive a recovery post '24? And then B, perhaps, Tracey, you gave us some detail on margin expectations. But how should we think about sort of the ability to get back to peak historical margins at some point over the next few years? And how quickly we might see margin recovery relative to this '24 base just as we think about those 4 building blocks you mentioned from here?Fabrizio FredaYes. In terms of the visibility to the guidance, obviously, if Tracey and I have given you this guidance, we believe that that's the -- in this moment, is the project of the business. So we have visibility and clarity in terms of our plans. I want, however, to underline that the volatility externally remain very, very high, particularly the volatility in the Chinese market, the volatility in the transition in the TR market from the Daigou to the regular travelers, the transition to the groups traveling. They've just been announced in terms of law.. The transition, obviously, on the judgment of what the economy recovery will be globally, particularly in the post-pandemic environment, particularly how the economy in China will evolve. So all these external elements are part, obviously -- or assumptions of these external elements are part of our guidance. And in the press release, we made an effort to explain all our assumptions in the guidance. And then in terms of our internal plans and in term of the continued leveraging our current trends on the things which are working, we are pretty confident. The real question is how fast we will be fixing the issues? But the strengths of the current trends of what is working are frankly more easy to predict than to forecast. So net, we believe in our guidance, but will be obviously volatility to be managed in the context of the future, and you will see as much as we will see the evolution in these areas. And then Tracey?Tracey Thomas TravisYes, Dara. So I mean, certainly, we are encouraged by some of the signs we see -- recent signs that we see in terms of recovery. The return of travelers. We are, as Fabrizio mentioned, in terms of our fiscal '24, taking actions to pretty dramatically pull back on some of our production so that we can get our inventory levels in line. And that will improve our margin. And I talked about in my prepared remarks that we're expecting gross margin recovery from some of those actions. As the situation normalizes and more travelers come back to travel retail, we are very confident in the strategy that we've had previously. Pre-pandemic, we were well on our way to those 20% operating margins. We don't see any reason why, once things normalize, that we can't get back to those 20% margins. Timing, I can't give you. I have said in our prepared remarks that we certainly, over the next few years, have plans to accelerate the margin progression well above our historical guidance of 50 basis points of margin improvement, and that does recommend -- that does represent a catch-up in margin progression and again, the strategies that we have to do that. But we are incredibly focused as an organization on returning to the margins that are more representative of our growth and our growth potential. I will also underscore the fact that we will not do that at the expense -- at the short-term expense of hurting our brands or hurting our markets that are in recovery, so it is a balancing act for us in terms of making sure we're making the right surgical investments that support not only the recovery and the markets that are further along in recovery, and as well as the long-term investments that we need to continue our growth algorithm of 6% to 8% top line growth and margin expansion. So again, I can't -- I know that's not the answer you're looking for in terms of you want a specific year and a specific number. And hopefully, we will be able to give that to you when we get a bit more clarity on more stabilization in the environment. But right now, you have the commitment of our entire organization that we recognize and have plans to accelerate our margin progression well beyond our historical levels in order to try to catch up.OperatorOur next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities.Christopher Michael CareySo just one quick follow-up, and then a kind of a geographic question. Just on the China travel retail inventory dynamic. Fabrizio, you had mentioned that there's going to be greater collaboration between your teams in Mainland and China travel retail. What's your confidence that some of the things that you may need to do to invest behind clearing your inventory won't impact brand equities and brand health? And I'm basically just trying to get a sense of the types of actions that you might be taking to clear inventory of -- consumption trends are as volatile as you say? And then just the geographic question would be, you had mentioned quite impressive growth rates in India but also some underperformance in North America. Just over the next 12 months or longer, how do you think about this non-Asia market progressing, with perhaps to touch on what you see in some of these newer, faster-growth markets?Fabrizio FredaYes. So I mean the -- in terms of the travel retail issue, you described it well. So we have increased the collaboration between the local team and the TR team just to have not only a better common decision-making on the key prioritization on the balancing act in order to create value and in order to continue to develop brand equities in a more coordinated way, but we also have more analytics to understand the channel dynamics, the pricing differentials and all the things. So we have created the base of much more information and timely information to take the right decisions in coordination. So this is a big improvement that should reduce the risk of non-coordinated actions in the future. Then the brand health that you also mentioned, I want to underline the brand health is evident from the results in China. The brand health in -- with the Chinese consumers is really strong. And we have good market share results, which we already mentioned. The business has been growing 36% in the April, June quarter. The online market share has been extremely strong, 2 points extra of online market share. Our activation and consumer passion for our brands has been further confirmed by external research that our brands are at the top of the ranking of desirable brands in the market. So the brand equity, the brand health, also thanks the extraordinary work of our Mainland region, China Mainland region team is in good shape. And then you said correctly that we are very focused on the sell-through of the stocks, just to talk about the stocks. Obviously, as Tracey has explained, in May, June, Hainan was relatively weak, and that's why there is an impact also on the first quarter trend. But is -- but we are very focused on creating the retail activities that will facilitate the sell-through, and that's the key focus of the team. So in that area, we are very aligned. We have the organization resources squared, and we are focused on all these issues very squarely. On the second part of your question is, if I can give you light on the other markets. I mean the -- I hope that the report is very clear. The rest of our business, ex the TR Asia, has been growing in the last quarter, 17%. This is one of our fastest growth rate ever despite North America flat. And so we have really undergone strengths in all the rest of our business, which is the results of all the brand strengths which I explained in the prepared remarks. So we have 4 very big brands, well above $1 billion brands, and we will have 2 more. So to be clear, we will be a company by the end of 2024 with $6 billion brands, extraordinary scale in the global system and global reach. So this is behind our strengths. Then I wanted to underline strength of our innovation. Our innovation is strong. It's also in tough challenging year like 2023, remains at 25%. And the innovation pipeline for 2024, 2025 is very, very strong. Particularly in 2025, we have some extra white spaces innovation, which are very promising. So this also will support the continuous strength of these other parts of the business -- other regions, as you mentioned. And then finally, the execution in this region has been stepping up because we explained that as the recovery from the pandemic progress, our ability to execute in the post-pandemic world has been developed and is getting better and better month after month. So in the regions which have been faster in the post-pandemic development, we have been faster in recovering great execution and great results, so this will continue to progress in 2024. So we have good confidence on that. On the U.S. where, on the contrary, we said there is work to be done, the team is very focused on doing this work. We have a very clear plan. Again, I summarized them in the prepared remarks, but to go back to them, our strategy in rebuilding the North America growth is really various -- these 4 big building blocks. The first one is a very rich pipeline of newness, which is later in 2024 and further enforced in 2025, focus on breakthrough innovation on new claims that will help also unlocking the consumers in online and specialty-multi more aggressively. We are driving higher E&amp;D through our investment in various platforms, including TikTok, or especially TikTok. We are focused on strategic pricing to drive value per unit in correct way, and we will continue to recruit consumers with very strong activities. Also commercial activities, which are focused on this, in support in the -- with the support of our retailers, which are very aligned on this front. And our high-touch services are continuing to evolving, particularly online, with new technology and new activities. So the -- I also want to underline that in North America, our business of M·A·C, our business of Clinique, our business of The Ordinary, so the entry price point brands is particularly important. The scale in North America in our business is the entry price point brands, and all these brands have very exciting brand-by-brand plan. And then, the opportunity in luxury fragrances is extraordinary. And you have seen the strength of luxury fragrances around the world, and now we will further leverage also in North America as the next steps. Keep in mind that in the luxury fragrance part of our portfolio in the last 10 quarters in a row had double-digit growth or more, despite North America has not yet fully leveraged these potential engines. So this will be another big addition as of 2024.OperatorOur next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.Bryan Douglass SpillaneI just have one question, and I think you've touched on it a couple of times in both the prepared remarks and the press release. It's just what's happening in Hainan with the Daigou and kind of the reseller market? So can you just -- as you're looking forward, is your expectation that it really -- that travel retail in Hainan specifically becomes really just more selling to individuals? And that the Daigou piece will be a lot smaller or maybe not even much of an element at all going forward? Just -- and if that's true, just how that changes how you're approaching operating in China now? Kind of, where do you make up those sales if you don't have the -- as big a presence with Daigou?Tracey Thomas TravisSo I'll start in terms of that question. We don't control it, right? We sell to our travel retail operators, and so the whole mix of who is buying in Hainan is really with our retail partners. Part of the adjustment that we are seeing right now is the timing of when regular travelers return to Hainan, when individual travelers, to your point, return to Hainan, and some of the changes in enforcement and regulations that have happened in China. And so there is a disconnect in timing that certainly is impacting our sales, combined with the fact that we are reducing the inventory levels that we have in Hainan. So that is all having a disproportionate effect. I think when we look at the development that has been done in Hainan, and we've talked about this for several years. Our expectation is that travelers, regular individual travelers, will return to Hainan and they will enjoy the fantastic shopping experience that has been created in Hainan, and we have no concerns whatsoever about travel retail growing with traveling consumers. It's a timing issue for us right now, and so I just wanted to really underscore that. It's a pretty -- it's having a timing issue that's having a big short-term, temporary impact for us. But we are not concerned at all about what we have shared with you in the past in terms of our strategy to continue to grow travel retail globally, and certainly in all of our markets in Asia.Fabrizio FredaYes. And I just want to add that we have a clear evidence that when the -- first of all, the regulations and the retailers decide to focus on individual travelers and when individual travelers traffic becomes strongly growing, the business results are outstanding. Our business in EMEA travel retail in this moment is flying, is a plus, I believe, 36%, plus 40%, and the same in the Americas. And now, the same will start in APAC, in Japan, in Australia, et cetera. So wherever there is a post-COVID return to travel, there is a very exciting business growth. And for example, the groups were allowed so far all in Thailand. And in Thailand, this created a very interesting extra sales, although to be clear, still below what was in the group since 2019, but there is a recovery trend. So the travel retail channel, in our opinion, remains very, very potential for the long term. And this business of selling to the traveling consumer during their travel is an exciting, profitable, equity-building business. What happened during the pandemic when this part of the business was closed has been a temporary distortion that will be rebalanced over time, as Tracey just explained. That is our expectation and our belief.OperatorOur next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.Lauren Rae LiebermanGreat. I wanted to talk a little bit about the Japan manufacturing facility and just, overall, Asia-based supply chain for Asia. And just to get a little bit more perspective maybe on where you stand, I guess, completion? Is it -- and I know you're not going to be able to give us something too specific, but is it by the end of the calendar year, Japan is able to fulfill all of the demand out of China? Just something to help us understand kind of the scale to get that up and running. And then the implication that has for length of supply chain and then visibility? Because if you're trying to manage in a more volatile backdrop and even offering what you have on time line for recovery in Hainan and travelers, and are they in Korea? And where are they and who are they? You need to be, I guess, more agile. And that local supply chain, I would think, would offer a lot of help on that front, but we don't really have a sense of when it becomes a local supply chain, if you will. So anything you can offer on that front would be really helpful, I think.Tracey Thomas TravisOkay. Thanks, Lauren. So part of the capital that we'll be spending this year is to complete the factory. So we've done some preproduction runs in fiscal '23. The factory will be producing a bit of the volume for the region in fiscal 2024. We have very specific plans on -- which, largely Skin Care, as we've talked in the past, some foundation products will be manufactured in the plant. Given where we're at right now, as you -- as we just spoke about in terms of Skin Care, that will be more gradual. So we have to first complete the plant. We also have opened a new, temporary distribution center in China. We'll be expanding on some of our distribution footprint in China as well. So I would say in terms of -- it will take a couple of years of ramp-up before we have the Asia supply chain fully operational and full from a capacity standpoint. That doesn't mean that as we gradually ramp up over this year and next year, we won't be creating more agility by being able to start to shift some of the production in those areas. But right now, we're working on contracting some of our production just given some of the shocks to the system. So you are absolutely right that long term this will create agility for us. There are other things that we're doing to create agility. We've talked in the past in terms of some of the investments we've made in technology to help our -- especially in a very dynamic demand environment in order to try to forecast more accurately. I don't know that any forecasting tool would have forecasted what we experienced this past year. But certainly, as we think about all of our new innovation, all of our SKUs, new brands, et cetera, the more that we can technology enable and coordinate our inventory planning and our supply planning, the better we will have from -- experience we will have from an agility standpoint as well. So there's a tremendous amount of work that is going on to very much improve the situation going forward. Right now, we're managing just some tremendous shocks to the system that we're in the process of correcting.Fabrizio FredaAnd I would just want to add a bit more color to the concept that Tracey just underlined on the fact that despite this will take a couple of years to ramp up to get to the full leveraging, the benefits on agility will come as we go earlier. And the reason for that is that the agility is particularly needed on what we call the heroes SKUs. So the high-volume and the high-volume SKU, the one which can benefit more from speed to market, forecasting decisions which are closer to the moment where the market happens, the ability to produce depending on the trends. And so we will gradually ramp up, but we will ramp up first the SKUs and the brands that have the biggest need to create agility in Asia. And over time, then this will become our, as Tracey described, ongoing in a couple of years, we will have the full agility of the system implement.OperatorThat concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Ross Stores topped quarterly estimates and improved its outlook, with its shares rising about 6% on Thursday upon Thursday's report during extended trading. Premium cosmetics giant, The Estee Lauder Companies (NYSE: EL), issued a weak guidance and slow recovery of its business in Asia. Farfetch Limited (NYSE: FTCH) stock tanked after the luxury fashion e-commerce retailer posted a big revenue miss and weaker than expected guidance. These latest reports continue the trend that Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) and Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) portrayed earlier which is that high-end and premium ‘wants’ retailers are on the losing side of this macroeconomic chapter, while necessities and off-price retailers are on the winning one, with customers still being willing to splurge and find bargainsf for discounted premium goods.Ross Stores jumped nearly 5% a day upon its report. Like TJX who reported steady sales of its discount apparel and accessories and a stronger than expected demand for home decor goods, the discount retailer topped both sales and earnings estimates for its second quarter.  Net sales grew 7.7% to $4.93 billion, topping the expected $4.75 billion with earnings per share amounting to $1.32, surpassing Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $1.16. While Ross Stores previously expected its 2023 same-store sales be stay relatively flat, it now expects them to expand between 2% and 3%. The off-price retailer also lifted its annual profit per share guidance from the previous range of $4.77 to $4.99 to a newly projected range of $5.15 to $5.26.As for the e-commerce fashion platform, Farfetch made a big revenue miss as it reported it generated $572 million in the second quarter, which is a far cry from Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $649 million. Its shares tanked 41% in early morning trading upon results as the e-commerce luxury fashion retailer provided a weaker-than-expected full year guidance as well as trimmed its gross merchandise value outlook. With a second quarter report riddled with disappointing figures and debt, Farfetch suffered on the side of losing high-end retailers.Story continuesEstee Lauder, who was once the star of challenging times thanks to “the lipstick index” its chairman coined, didn’t get to be a winner in these post-pandemic recessionary times. As skincare replacing lipsticks when COVID-19 started its relentless march across the globe, now the beauty brand reported declining sales for its fiscal fourth quarter. Still, it succeeded to top fourth quarter earnings and revenue estimates. Adjusted earnings per share of 7 cents surpassed the loss of 4 cents per share that Refinitiv’s survey of analysts expected, while revenue of $3.61 billion topped Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $3.48 billion. For the undergoing first fiscal quarter, Estee Lauder is expecting an EPS loss in the range between 31 and 21 cents per share, while Fact Set’s survey of analysts earnings per share of 98 cents. Its shares tanked 4% as the cosmetics giant lowered its full-year outlook.Consumer Behavior Brought Darkness To High End Retailers And Dawn To Discounted RetailersTJX and Ross Stores inflation-hit customers shopped for its discounted clothing and shoes and looking for bargains on premium apparel brands. Despite tightened household spending, consumers looked for cheaper deals on both essentials and non-essentials. While high-end retailers struggled with bloated inventories, they were ‘rescued’ by discounting retailers who got to offer a wider assortment as a result of offloading their inventories. Therefore, consumers are not willing to give up on splurges despite tightened budgets but are approaching them in a cost-conscious way, leaving high-end retailers in the dark while boosting revenue of discount retailers such as TJX and Ross Stores.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

However, higher mortgage rates are dampening housing market activity lately.High Mortgage Rates a Concern?Mortgage rates have touched their highest level in more than two decades. According to the latest Freddie Mac's release, the average rate for the 30-year fixed mortgage climbed to 7.09% — the highest point since the first week of April 2002.  This is just the third time rates have exceeded 7% since then. Rates are higher than 5.13% recorded in the year-ago period.The increase in rates coupled with a near-record surge in home prices has made home ownership more expensive for first-time buyers, discouraging people from buying homes. The surge came following the rise in yields propelled by a series of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. Further increases in interest rates will continue to weigh on prospective buyers and homeowners looking to finance. The central bank seems unlikely to ease monetary policy anytime soon.Against this backdrop, U.S. homebuilder confidence weakened in August for the first time this year. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index dropped to 50 in August from a 13-month peak of 56 in July. According to the NAHB chair and a homebuilder and developer from Birmingham, Alabama, “rising mortgage rates and high construction costs stemming from a dearth of construction workers, a lack of buildable lots and ongoing shortages of distribution transformers put a chill on builder sentiment in August.”Buffett’s Big Bet Signals OptimismWarren Buffett is betting big on the U.S. housing market. Per the latest 13F filing, the legendary investor introduced new stakes in D.R. Horton DHI, NVR Inc NVR and Lennar Corp LEN during the second quarter. Warren Buffett invested $814 million across three home builders. He primarily focused on D.R. Horton, purchasing six million shares in the company, worth roughly $726 million at the end of the second quarter. Berkshire purchased more than 152,000 shares in Lennar and 11,000 shares in NVR.DHI and LEN currently have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each and NVR has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating their outperformance in the weeks ahead. These are also considered to be good value picks as they have a solid Value Score of B each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The billionaire’s move indicates the resilience and potential of the U.S. housing market and could be a bullish sign. Historically, when Berkshire Hathaway takes a position in a sector, it often leads to increased investor interest and, sometimes, a rally in the associated stocks.While the housing market is struggling with higher mortgage rates, Buffett's bet suggests more opportunities for homebuilders than threats.Story continuesOther Solid TrendsNew home construction has picked up in recent months, with housing starts rising 3.9% to 1.452 million units in July. Low inventory in the existing home market continued to boost interest in new homes. Further, with the rise in remote work culture, a large number of employees are seeking larger homes or relocating to areas with a lower cost of living.The homebuilding sector belongs to a solid industry, which is placed in the top 2% in terms of ranking among more than 250 Zacks industries.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Instead, they are forecasting a slight increase.""We are revising our home price forecasts higher, to 1.8% for full-year 2023 vs. -2.2% prior, and 3.5% in 2024 vs. 2.8% prior,"" Vinay Viswanathan, a fixed income strategist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note for the firm's housing team. “These forecasts imply home prices will remain roughly unchanged through [the] year-end and then return to trend growth levels in 2024.”This comes as home prices have resumed an upward trend and mortgage rates remain elevated, creating a bleak homeownership situation for many Americans. Goldman Sachs analysts previously thought that higher mortgage rates would put more downward pressure on home prices.After declining month over month for seven straight months late last year and into 2023, home prices reversed course in February have stayed that way through May, the latest month for which there is data from Case-Shiller's national price index.Craig Lazzara, managing director at S&amp;P DJI, said the data backs the case that the final month of monthly declines was in January.There are two key drivers supporting home prices, Viswanathan wrote.First, housing supply remains tight. The share of available existing homes for sale is around 1 million now, while that inventory was closer to 2 million homes before the pandemic, according to data from the National Association of Realtors data cited by Goldman.At the same time, while the supply of new homes continues to increase as builders step up their construction plans, ""most of this new inventory is still under construction,"" Viswanathan noted. ""New completions, on the other hand, remain below pre-COVID levels.""Housing starts for new single-family units increased by 6.7% in July from the month prior, according to the Census Bureau data out Wednesday, while completions registered a smaller 1.3% gain.Story continuesSecond, demand for housing remains stronger than expected.Based on the firm's housing affordability index hitting record lows, the Goldman Sachs analysts expected that home prices would need to decline nationwide before buyers would bite. But that conclusion has changed.""We trace most of this demand to non-economic sources: household formation and seasonal turnover,"" Viswanathan wrote. ""While high frequency data suggests housing turnover may moderate, household formation is well above its long-term trend.""Housing Affordability Index hit the lowest level on record this week (Source: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research)Housing affordability has worsened over the past year due to high mortgage rates, with the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage climbing north of 7% in the past week, Freddie Mac reported. While so far many homebuyers have swallowed these increased costs, they ""demonstrated behavior that, in our view, reflects unsustainable adaptations to elevated mortgage rates,"" Goldman Sachs noted.For instance, the average debt-to-income ratio on conforming purchase mortgages is over 38%, ""a significant aberration from post-Global Financial Crisis averages,"" Viswanathan wrote.""In addition, smaller and lower price homes have seen stronger price growth than larger, higher-quality properties. That said, we expect mortgage rates fall by 100 basis point through the end of next year, somewhat stabilizing affordability,"" Viswanathan wrote.A for sale sign stands outside a home on Nevada Avenue Thursday, June 22, 2023, in Colorado Springs, Colo.

However, homebuilders have seen an upsurge in their share prices for most of this year, thanks to a rebound in new home sales that took a beating last year due to the housing slump.Homebuilders, all through this year, have applied innovative strategies to attract potential buyers of new homes. They have kept affordable prices on the properties and offered mortgage rate buydowns. Shortage of existing homes in the housing market has also increased the requirement for newly constructed homes, eventually enhancing the sales figures for housebuilders.In reality, the construction of new homes picked up in July. After being adjusted seasonally, the annual rate of housing starts climbed to 1.452 million last month, per the Census Bureau. It surpassed market expectations of 1.448 million.Single-family housing starts, which mostly constitute the bulk of the construction, jumped 6.7% in July from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 983,000 units. The jump in single-family housing starts was primarily seen in the western part of the United States. Additionally, building permits ticked up 0.1% to an annual rate of 1.442 million units last month. Applications to build one-family homes increased to their highest level in more than a year.Let us also not forget that construction spending in the United States already increased strongly in June. Outlays on constructing single and multifamily housing establishments rose 0.5% in June, while May’s figure was revised to show spending increasing 1.1% from an earlier reported 0.9%, per the Commerce Department. Thus, with builders ramping up housing construction as buyers search for reasonably priced homes, housing stocks like D.R. Horton DHI, Lennar LEN and NVR NVR are well-poised to benefit soon.What’s more, one of the best role models for any investor, Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B) recently disclosed that he has made big bets on these three U.S. home builders in the second quarter of 2023. The Oracle of Omaha’s Berkshire Hathaway owned DR Horton, Lennar and NVR shares worth a total of $814 million, as of Jun 30.Story continuesThus, these stocks make compelling investment choices at the moment.

After all, a 20% earnings rise (though it apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.On the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They, in fact, club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Find Stocks That Can Beat?Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.Story continuesThe Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to only 12.Here are five out of 12 stocks:Yum China: The Zacks Rank #2 company operates both company-owned and franchised restaurants. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The average earnings surprise of YUMC for the past four quarters is 31.74%.Amazon.com: The Zacks Rank #1 company is one of the largest e-commerce providers, with sprawling operations in North America, now spreading across the globe.The average earnings surprise of AMZN for the past four quarters is 40.96%.Workday: The Zacks Rank #1 company is a provider of enterprise-level software solutions for financial management and human resource domains.The average earnings surprise of WDAY for the past four quarters is 13.05%.aTyr Pharma: It is a bio-therapeutics company.

It threatened to cancel every ticket that Skiplagged has sold.In a practice called skiplagging and hidden-city ticketing, travelers book a flight that includes at least one stop, but they leave the plane during a layover. Generally skiplagging is not illegal, but airlines claim that it violates their policies.Last month, American booted a 17-year-old from a flight and banned him for three years when he tried to use the tactic to fly from Gainesville, Florida, to Charlotte, North Carolina, on a ticket that listed New York City as his destination. For the teen, that was cheaper than booking a flight directly to Charlotte.In the lawsuit, American accused Skiplagged of tricking consumers into believing they can tap “some kind of secret ‘loophole.’” American said the website poses as an ordinary consumer to buy tickets, and warns its customers not to tip off the airline about the arrangement.American said Skiplagged has never been authorized to resell the airline's tickets.“Skiplagged’s conduct is deceptive and abusive,” the airline said in the lawsuit. “Skiplagged deceives the public into believing that, even though it has no authority to form and issue a contract on American’s behalf, somehow it can still issue a completely valid ticket. It cannot. Every ‘ticket’ issued by Skiplagged is at risk of being invalidated.”There was no immediate response to a request for comment left with Skiplagged.Skiplagging is possible because of the way airlines compete on price.Long flights usually cost more than shorter ones, but the reverse might be true if many airlines compete on the longer route while only one or two fly the shorter one.Travelers who use the tactic avoid checking a bag, since it will wind up at the ticketed destination, not the layover airport. They often book one-way tickets, or only try this strategy on the return trip – if the airline notices someone skipping out, it might cancel the rest of their itinerary.Skiplagged, which is based in New York, has been sued before.United Airlines and online travel agency Orbitz accused Aktarer Zaman, who was in his early 20s when he started Skiplagged around 2014, of touting “prohibited forms of travel.” Zaman started a GoFundMe to pay his legal costs. He settled with Orbitz, and the United lawsuit was dismissed.]"

266,428fae08-b4e6-3312-a2e6-e2a96798abb8,ETN,2023-08-19,Here's Why Flowserve (FLS) Should Grace Your Portfolio Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-flowserve-fls-grace-165100723.html,1692377460,STORY,"['FLS', 'AOS', 'ENS', 'ETN']","[Flowserve Corporation FLS is thriving on the back of strong maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) and aftermarket activity. The company’s healthy margin performance owing to solid operational execution, pricing actions and improving supply chains is encouraging.Let’s delve deeper to unearth the factors that make investing in this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company a smart choice now.Record Booking Levels: Record levels of booking due to strong MRO and aftermarket activity are driving Flowserve's growth. The company’s second-quarter bookings of $1.1 billion marked the sixth consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion bookings. Solid booking levels highlight the strength across the company’s end markets. In the second quarter, bookings increased 20% and 12% in general industries and oil and gas markets, respectively. The same increased in the 2-3% range in power and water.Flowserve expects the uptrend in bookings to continue through 2024, driven by strong MRO and aftermarket activity levels. Solid operational execution, pricing actions and improving supply chains are aiding the company’s margins. In the first six months of 2023, gross margin increased to 30% from 27% in the year-ago period. On a further positive note, FLS expects to achieve run-rate cost savings of $50 million by the end of this year. Cost-control actions are expected to drive the company’s bottom line.Improved Guidance: Following strong second-quarter performance, Flowserve raised its 2023 guidance. The company expects revenues to increase 16-18% year over year in 2023 compared with a 10-12% rise anticipated earlier. Adjusted earnings are estimated to be between $1.85 and $2.00 compared with $1.65-$1.85 anticipated earlier.Expansion Initiatives: Flowserve focuses on acquiring businesses/assets to expand its product offerings. In February 2023, the company inked a deal to acquire Velan Inc. in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $245 million. The buyout will strengthen Flowserve’s valves portfolio and build upon its existing assets through the addition of Velan’s premier brands, strong heritage and technical expertise in diverse end markets. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2023.Velan will become part of Flowserve’s Flow Control Division segment. The company expects to achieve annualized cost synergies of at least $20 million from the acquisition by the end of the first year. The transaction is expected to be accretive to Flowserve’s adjusted earnings in the first year.Rewards to Shareholders: Flowserve is committed to rewarding its shareholders handsomely. In the first half of 2023, the company paid dividends of $52.5 million. In 2022, the company paid out dividends worth $104.5 million to its shareholders.Price Performance: Shares of Flowserve have outperformed its industry in the year-to-date period primarily due to strong booking levels. The stock has gained 22.6% in the period compared with the industry’s rise of 9.1%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNorthbound Estimate Revisions: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Flowserve’s 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 8.8% in the past 60 days.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks within the Industrial Products sector are as follows:A.

ATO – are all gearing up to join the elite club.In addition to their shareholder-friendly nature, all three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, indicating optimism among analysts. For those interested in reaping a steady and reliable income stream, let’s take a closer look at each.AflacAflac is an American insurance company and a massive supplier of supplemental insurance within the U.S. Analysts have taken their earnings expectations modestly higher across the board, helping to land the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAFL shares currently yield 2.2% annually, just a tick below its Zacks Insurance – Accident &amp; Health industry average. The company’s dividend payout has grown by a solid 12.4% annualized over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, AFL shares aren’t overly expensive given the company’s forecasted growth, with shares trading at a current 12.8X forward earnings multiple (F1). Aflac’s earnings are forecasted to climb 12.2% in its current year.Sherwin-WilliamsSherwin-Williams, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), manufactures paints, coatings, and other related products.

Still, the company’s 17% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps to pick up the slack.Atmos Energy Atmos Energy and its subsidiaries are engaged in regulated natural gas distribution and storage business. Like the stocks above, analysts have raised their earnings outlook, with the stock currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchATO shares currently pay 2.5% annually, with the company’s payout ratio sitting at 50% of its earnings.

Looking ahead to FY24, expectations allude to a further 6.7% of bottom line growth paired with a 10% revenue boost.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineDividend-paying stocks deserve a spot in nearly every portfolio, as the payouts help limit drawbacks in other positions, provide a passive income stream, and provide the ability to achieve maximum returns through dividend reinvestment.And for those seeking companies with a long track record of boosting payouts, all three stocks above – Sherwin-Williams SHW, Aflac AFL, and Atmos Energy Corp.

ATO – are all gearing up to join the elite club.In addition to their shareholder-friendly nature, all three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, indicating optimism among analysts. For those interested in reaping a steady and reliable income stream, let’s take a closer look at each.AflacAflac is an American insurance company and a massive supplier of supplemental insurance within the U.S. Analysts have taken their earnings expectations modestly higher across the board, helping to land the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAFL shares currently yield 2.2% annually, just a tick below its Zacks Insurance – Accident &amp; Health industry average. The company’s dividend payout has grown by a solid 12.4% annualized over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, AFL shares aren’t overly expensive given the company’s forecasted growth, with shares trading at a current 12.8X forward earnings multiple (F1). Aflac’s earnings are forecasted to climb 12.2% in its current year.Sherwin-WilliamsSherwin-Williams, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), manufactures paints, coatings, and other related products. Analysts raised their expectations across the board in a big way following the company’s latest quarterly release.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegarding the mentioned quarter, Sherwin-Williams posted a sizable 21% EPS beat and reported revenue 3.7% ahead of expectations, with the market reacting favorably to the print post-earnings.Story continuesAs we can see below, the company’s revenue has remained on a healthy trend, with the $6.2 billion mark in its latest release reflecting a quarterly record.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, SHW shares yield 0.9% annually, below its Zacks industry average by a fair margin. Still, the company’s 17% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps to pick up the slack.Atmos Energy Atmos Energy and its subsidiaries are engaged in regulated natural gas distribution and storage business. Like the stocks above, analysts have raised their earnings outlook, with the stock currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchATO shares currently pay 2.5% annually, with the company’s payout ratio sitting at 50% of its earnings. And over the last five years, the payout has grown by 9% annualized.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the company sports solid growth expectations, with earnings forecasted to climb 8% in its current fiscal year on 22% higher revenues. Looking ahead to FY24, expectations allude to a further 6.7% of bottom line growth paired with a 10% revenue boost.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineDividend-paying stocks deserve a spot in nearly every portfolio, as the payouts help limit drawbacks in other positions, provide a passive income stream, and provide the ability to achieve maximum returns through dividend reinvestment.And for those seeking companies with a long track record of boosting payouts, all three stocks above – Sherwin-Williams SHW, Aflac AFL, and Atmos Energy Corp. ATO – precisely fit the criteria.Besides their shareholder-friendly natures, all three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, indicating optimism among analysts.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That’s impressive. They are rich.How’d they do it?None of those in the article were best selling novelists, movie stars, or professional athletes. That makes it seem even more obtainable for you and I. If they can do it, why not us?Lessons from Rich RetireesThose featured in the article seemingly had similar paths they followed to achieve this incredible wealth. This included,1.       They started investing early2.       They maxed out their 401ks3.       They invested in equities, both individual stocks and index funds. You don’t have to get fancy.Keep it SimpleThe stocks listed in the article were big caps that you and I could also own. When Tracey has talked with her friend Ed, another rich retiree with a million-dollar stock portfolio, he too owned basic, large cap stocks, many of which paid dividends.None were IPOs or a small cap stock that was largely unknown to most investors. These rich investors had kept it simple.1.       Bank of America (BAC)Warren Buffett has owned Bank of America in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio for years. It’s up 108.3% over the last 10 years, but that’s underperforming the S&amp;P 500 which is up 170% during that same time.Story continuesBank of America pays an attractive dividend again, however, now yielding 3%, which gives long-term investors even more firepower for compounding.Should value investors be considering a bank like Bank of America again?2.       The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW)Sherwin-Williams rarely gets much attention on the business shows like CNBC or Fox Business. But Tracey’s friend Ed has owned it for decades. Over the last 10 years, shares of Sherwin-Williams are up 437.8% with the dividends reinvested. That’s an annualized return of 18.3%.$10,000 invested in Sherwin-Williams in 2013 would be worth $53,780 in 2023.Does Sherwin-Williams still have further upside?3.       NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)NVIDIA was mentioned in the article as a holding by one of the rich retirees. If you had bought NVIDIA just 10 years ago, it would have gone up an astounding 11,786%.But in 2022, shares sold off so it now has a 2-year return of “just” 117%. But NVIDIA is a leader in AI and revenue is expected to rise 59% this fiscal year to $43 billion from $26 billion last year. That’s impressive.Is NVIDIA a good buy-and-hold stock for long-term investors?4.       Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)Berkshire Hathaway shares have been hitting new all-time highs in 2023. For investors looking for a way to track Buffett’s moves, including buy-and-hold, why not just buy shares of Berkshire’s B shares?Shares of Berkshire Hathaway are up 218.9% over the last 10 years which beat the S&amp;P 500 which was up just 170% during that same time. Over 20 years, Berkshire is up 600.9% versus the S&amp;P 500 gaining 338.5%.Should Berkshire Hathaway be on your short list?5.       Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VOO)Many of the rich retirees said they owned “indexes.” They didn’t say which index but the most common one is the S&amp;P 500. The Vanguard 500 Index (VOO) is one of the most common choices for those who want to own the S&amp;P 500 in an ETF because it has a low expense ratio of just 0.04%.Tracey owns shares of VOO in her own personal portfolio. It’s up 14.1% year-to-date but hasn’t yet hit another new all-time high this year. Buffett is a big fan of owning the indexes, like the VOO.Should the VOO be the first step in growing your own million-dollar portfolio?What Else Do You Need to Know About Retiring with Millions?    Tune into this week’s podcast to find out. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Both Primo and American Water Works have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.PRMW currently has a forward P/E ratio of 20.19, while AWK has a forward P/E of 28.85. We also note that PRMW has a PEG ratio of 1.14. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. AWK currently has a PEG ratio of 3.53.Another notable valuation metric for PRMW is its P/B ratio of 1.89. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, AWK has a P/B of 2.77.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to PRMW's Value grade of B and AWK's Value grade of D.Both PRMW and AWK are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that PRMW is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read Goldman Sachs Dividend Stocks: Top 5 Stock Picks.Investors love dividend stocks because they are reliable and often a refuge during tough times when the economy and markets are wavering. More importantly, dividends have a strong history of keeping up with inflation. In the US, companies that provide dividends usually perform better during times of high inflation and increasing interest rates compared to non-dividend payers. Additionally, they're often seen as safer choices, declining less than the overall market during downturns. This defensive quality is especially significant in the current unpredictable circumstances. Since 1926, dividends have represented nearly one-third of the stock market’s overall returns.Dividend stocks experienced a slight drop this year as other asset classes began to catch the interest of investors. This doesn't mean that dividend stocks have lost their appeal, as their demand remains steady regardless of the economic situation. In one of our previous articles on dividend investing we cited data from Fidelity Investments, which mentioned that dividends made over half of the market's gains in high inflationary periods. The study also highlighted specific periods, like the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, where dividends accounted for 67%, 44%, and 73% of market gains, respectively. These decades saw inflation averaging above 5%, and overall returns were less than 10%.Also read: Goldman Sachs Tech Stocks: Top 12 Stock PicksEarlier this year, David Kostin, a Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist, gave an optimistic view regarding dividend stocks. He expects a 5% increase in dividend payments from S&amp;P 500 companies this year, with the potential for further growth. Here are some comments from the analyst:""We expect that S&amp;P 500 DPS [dividend-per-share] will reach $70 in 2023 and $73 (+4%) in 2024. Recent company actions also point to a healthy dividend growth environment. The difference in outlooks for dividend and buyback growth suggests firms focusing on dividends will continue to outperform buyback stocks.""Story continuesHe further mentioned that investors often consider companies that have long dividend growth histories because such companies are often financially sound, with the ability to generate sustained profits. By continuously boosting dividends, these companies prioritize providing returns to their shareholders, appealing to those seeking stable income and potential capital appreciation.In this article, we will discuss the top dividend stocks in Goldman Sachs's portfolio. Some of them include NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and S&amp;P Global Inc.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved EYLEA HD (aflibercept) Injection 8 mg for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD), diabetic macular edema (DME) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). The recommended dose for EYLEA HD is 8 mg (0.07 mL of 114.3 mg/mL solution) every 4 weeks (monthly) for the first 3 months across all indications, followed by 8 mg every 8 to 16 weeks (2 to 4 months) in wAMD and DME and every 8 to 12 weeks (2 to 3 months) for DR.“The FDA approval of EYLEA HD is an important advancement in retinal care,” said Peter Kaiser, M.D., Chaney Family Endowed Chair in Ophthalmology Research at the Cole Eye Institute and Professor of Ophthalmology at Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine. “With EYLEA HD, patients with wet age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinal disease can now receive less frequent injections after their initial monthly doses and still experience the similar visual gains, anatomic improvements and safety profile of EYLEA.”“I look forward to offering EYLEA HD to my patients as a new treatment option that builds off of the established efficacy and safety profile of EYLEA,” said Allen C. Ho M.D., Director of Retina Research and Co-Director of the Retina Service of Wills Eye Hospital and Professor of Ophthalmology at Thomas Jefferson University. “In its clinical trial program, EYLEA HD demonstrated an unprecedented ability to maintain vision with extended dosing intervals, which created an exciting new advancement in the treatment of our patients with serious retinal diseases.”Story continuesThe FDA approval is based on the 48-week results of PULSAR and PHOTON – two double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trials evaluating EYLEA HD compared to EYLEA (aflibercept) Injection 2 mg. Both the PULSAR trial in wAMD (N=1,009) and PHOTON trial in DME (N=658) met their primary endpoint, with EYLEA HD demonstrating non-inferior and clinically equivalent vision gains at 48 weeks with both 12- and 16-week dosing regimens after only 3 initial monthly doses, compared to an EYLEA 8-week dosing regimen after initial monthly doses (3 in PULSAR and 5 in PHOTON). The vast majority of patients randomized at baseline to EYLEA HD 12- or 16-week dosing regimens (following 3 initial monthly doses) were able to maintain these dosing intervals through 48 weeks.The most common adverse reactions (≥3%) reported in patients treated with EYLEA HD were cataract, conjunctival hemorrhage, intraocular pressure increased, ocular discomfort/eye pain/eye irritation, vision blurred, vitreous floaters, vitreous detachment, corneal epithelium defect, and retinal hemorrhage.“More than 10 years ago, we fundamentally changed the way that certain serious retinal diseases were treated with the introduction of EYLEA. With the approval of EYLEA HD, we have elevated the high standard that EYLEA set,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Board co-Chair, President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron, and a principal inventor of EYLEA. “Our continued commitment to retinal diseases resulted in an important scientific innovation – evolving the proven efficacy and safety of EYLEA into a new treatment, EYLEA HD, that provides lasting vision control with even fewer injections to further benefit those living with wet age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinal diseases.""Regeneron is committed to helping patients who have been prescribed EYLEA HD access their medication. EYLEA 4U helps patients understand how EYLEA HD may be covered by their health insurance plans and assists eligible patients who need financial assistance for their EYLEA HD prescription. For more information, please call 1-855-EYLEA4U (1-855-395-3248) Option 4, or visit www.EYLEAHD.com.EYLEA HD is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Bayer AG. In the U.S., Regeneron maintains exclusive rights to EYLEA and EYLEA HD. Bayer has licensed the exclusive marketing rights outside of the U.S., where the companies share equally the profits from sales of EYLEA and EYLEA HD following any regulatory approvals.Regulatory filings for aflibercept 8 mg are under review in Europe and Japan. Submissions to other regulatory authorities in additional countries are also planned.About the EYLEA HD Clinical Trial Program PULSAR in wAMD and PHOTON in DME are double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trials that are being conducted in multiple centers globally. In both trials, patients were randomized into 3 treatment groups to receive either: EYLEA HD every 12 weeks, EYLEA HD every 16 weeks, or EYLEA every 8 weeks. The lead sponsors of the trials were Bayer for PULSAR and Regeneron for PHOTON.Patients treated with EYLEA HD in both trials had 3 initial monthly doses, and patients treated with EYLEA received 3 initial doses in PULSAR and 5 in PHOTON. In the first year, patients in the EYLEA HD groups could have their dosing intervals shortened down to an every 8-week interval if protocol-defined criteria for disease progression were observed. Intervals could not be extended until the second year of the study. Patients in all EYLEA groups maintained a fixed 8-week dosing regimen throughout their participation in the trials. One-year results were first presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology annual meeting in September 2022. Topline two-year results for PHOTON and PULSAR were shared in 2023.About wAMD and Diabetic Eye DiseasewAMD is a retinal disease that may affect people as they age. It occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow and leak fluid under the macula, the part of the eye responsible for sharp central vision and seeing fine detail. This fluid can damage and scar the macula, which can cause vision loss. An estimated 1.4 million Americans have wAMD.DR is an eye disease characterized by microvascular damage to the blood vessels in the retina often caused by poor blood sugar control in people with diabetes. The disease generally starts as nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and often has no warning signs or symptoms. NPDR may progress to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), a stage of the disease in which abnormal blood vessels grow onto the surface of the retina and into the vitreous cavity, potentially causing severe vision loss.DME can occur at any stage of DR as the blood vessels in the retina become increasingly fragile and leak fluid, potentially causing visual impairment. In the U.S., approximately 1.5 million adults are diagnosed with DME, while approximately 6 million people have DR without DME.About Ophthalmology at RegeneronAt Regeneron, we relentlessly pursue groundbreaking innovations in eye care science to help maintain the eye health of the millions of Americans impacted by vision-threatening conditions. Over a decade ago, our breakthrough scientific research resulted in the development of EYLEA, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor designed to block the growth of new blood vessels and decrease the ability of fluid to pass through blood vessels in the eye. EYLEA has since brought fundamental change to the retinal disease treatment landscape and is supported by a robust body of research that includes eight pivotal Phase 3 trials, 11 years of real-world experience, and more than 64 million EYLEA injections globally.Regeneron continues to advance our anti-angiogenesis expertise with new solutions with the aim of offering optimal flexibility for a broad group of patients and eye care professionals. This includes EYLEA HD, which has been developed with the aim of extending the time between injections, while maintaining the vision gains, anatomic benefits and safety previously observed with EYLEA.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATIONSINDICATIONSEYLEA HD (aflibercept) 8 mg is a prescription medicine approved for the treatment of patients with Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR).EYLEA® (aflibercept) 2 mg is a prescription medicine approved for the treatment of patients with Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Macular Edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), and Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) (0.4 mg).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION EYLEA HD and EYLEA are administered by injection into the eye. You should not use EYLEA HD or EYLEA if you have an infection in or around the eye, eye pain or redness, or known allergies to any of the ingredients in EYLEA HD or EYLEA, including aflibercept.Injections into the eye with EYLEA HD or EYLEA can result in an infection in the eye and retinal detachment (separation of retina from back of the eye) can occur. Inflammation in the eye has been reported with the use of EYLEA HD and EYLEA.In some patients, injections with EYLEA HD or EYLEA may cause a temporary increase in eye pressure within 1 hour of the injection. Sustained increases in eye pressure have been reported with repeated injections, and your doctor may monitor this after each injection.In infants with Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), treatment with EYLEA will need extended periods of ROP monitoring.There is a potential but rare risk of serious and sometimes fatal side effects, related to blood clots, leading to heart attack or stroke in patients receiving EYLEA HD or EYLEA.The most common side effects reported in patients receiving EYLEA HD were cataract, increased redness in the eye, increased pressure in the eye, eye discomfort, pain, or irritation, blurred vision, vitreous (gel-like substance) floaters, vitreous detachment, injury to the outer layer of the eye, and bleeding in the back of the eye.The most common side effects reported in patients receiving EYLEA were increased redness in the eye, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, moving spots in the field of vision, and increased pressure in the eye.The most common side effects reported in pre-term infants with ROP receiving EYLEA were separation of the retina from the back of the eye, increased redness in the eye, and increased pressure in the eye. Side effects that occurred in adults are considered applicable to pre-term infants with ROP, though not all were seen in clinical studies.You may experience temporary visual changes after an EYLEA HD or EYLEA injection and associated eye exams; do not drive or use machinery until your vision recovers sufficiently.Contact your doctor right away if you think you or your baby might be experiencing any side effects, including eye pain or redness, light sensitivity, or blurring of vision, after an injection.For additional safety information, please talk to your doctor and see the full Prescribing Information for EYLEA HD and EYLEA.You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

Without proper gene regulation, the mechanism may start attacking normal cells of the body.With Veopoz's approval, the pre-approval inspection issues related to the marketing application of the higher dose of its blockbuster eye disease drug Eylea has been addressed, the company said.The regulator's decision on the 8mg dose of Eylea is expected in the next few weeks, the company added.The FDA had in June declined to approve the higher-dose version following an inspection at third-party manufacturer Catalent.Analysts have said an approval of the higher-dose version could provide Regeneron a defense against rivals such as Roche's Vabysmo.Veopoz's approval was backed by data from a mid-to-late stage study, in which it showed normalization of serum albumin — a disease biomarker — and improvement or no worsening of clinical symptoms in all patients.The drug blocks the activity of a particular factor of the microbes-destroying mechanism and prevents occurrence of the CHAPLE disease.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Veopoz™ (pozelimab-bbfg) for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with CHAPLE disease, also known as CD55-deficient protein-losing enteropathy. Veopoz is the first and only treatment indicated specifically for CHAPLE. With the approval of Veopoz, the pre-approval inspection issues related to the aflibercept 8 mg BLA have been addressed. FDA action on the aflibercept 8 mg BLA is expected in the next few weeks.“Most patients with CHAPLE disease are children who face severely debilitating symptoms and often life-threatening complications that begin in infancy,” said Michael Lenardo, M.D., Chief, Molecular Development of the Immune System Section; Co-Director, Clinical Genomics Program, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH). “As an investigator in this pivotal trial and one of the discoverers of this disease, I saw first-hand the transformational clinical improvement that pozelimab achieves in those suffering from CHAPLE. The approval of pozelimab is a milestone to celebrate, providing a new medicine that can help these long-suffering patients.”CHAPLE is an ultra-rare and life-threatening hereditary immune disease driven by an overactivation of the complement system. In healthy individuals, the complement system is a mechanism for destroying microbes. However, those living with CHAPLE are unable to regulate complement activity due to mutations in their CD55 gene. Without proper CD55 regulation, the complement system may attack normal cells, causing damage to blood and lymph vessels along the upper digestive tract and leading to the loss of circulating proteins. There are fewer than 10 patients with CHAPLE disease identified in the U.S.Story continuesVeopoz, a fully human monoclonal antibody, is designed to target complement factor C5, a protein involved in complement system activation.“As the first-ever treatment for CHAPLE, Veopoz is a testament to our commitment to uncovering genetic insights and applying them to the development of effective treatments for patients in need – regardless of the prevalence of their disease,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Board co-Chair, President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. “Beyond CHAPLE, we believe Veopoz has promise in a variety of complement-mediated diseases and are driving forward several clinical programs to explore its broader potential.”Life-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in patients treated with complement inhibitors. Meningococcal infections may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Complete or update meningococcal vaccination at least two weeks prior to administering the first dose of Veopoz, unless the risks of delaying therapy outweigh the risks of developing meningococcal infection. If urgent therapy is indicated in a patient who is not up-to-date with both meningococcal vaccines according to Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations, administer meningococcal vaccines as soon as possible and provide the patient with antibacterial drug prophylaxis. Vaccination reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of meningococcal infections.Regeneron is committed to helping people with rare diseases access their medications. Assistance for eligible CHAPLE patients, including information on treatment, insurance coverage, and financial support, will be available through Regeneron’s myRARE™ patient support program. Patients can call 1-833-4my-RARE (1-833-469-7273) for more information.Healthcare providers with questions regarding Veopoz access outside the United States can contact Clinigen at medicineaccess@clinigengroup.com and register for an account to request access at https://www.clinigengroup.com/direct/en/invitation-form/.Veopoz was reviewed under Priority Review, and the Company received a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review voucher upon approval. Veopoz was previously granted Rare Pediatric Disease designation, Orphan Disease designation and Fast Track designation.About the Pivotal CHAPLE TrialThe FDA approval is based on results from a Phase 2/3 open-label trial that investigated the efficacy and safety of pozelimab in 10 patients aged 3 to 19 (median of 8.5 years). Patients were given a single loading dose of pozelimab 30 mg/kg intravenously on day 1, followed by subcutaneous weekly weight-based doses of pozelimab.All ten patients achieved normalization of serum albumin and serum IgG concentrations by week 12 and maintained these concentrations through at least 72 weeks of treatment. Five of the 10 patients received a total of 60 albumin transfusions in the 48 weeks prior to treatment. In the 48 weeks after starting treatment, one patient received one albumin transfusion. Nine of the 10 patients were hospitalized for a total of 268 days in the 48 weeks prior to treatment. In the 48 weeks after starting treatment, two patients were hospitalized for a total of 7 days.The most common adverse reactions occurring in two or more patients included upper respiratory tract infection, fracture, urticaria, and alopecia.About VeopozVeopoz was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology and is a fully human, monoclonal antibody designed to block the activity of complement factor C5 and prevent diseases mediated by the complement pathway. It is an IgG4 antibody that binds with high affinity to wild-type and variant human C5.As part of its ongoing development program, Veopoz is also being evaluated in combination with Alnylam’s cemdisiran (siRNAi C5 inhibitor) as an investigational combination therapy for the treatment of other complement-mediated disorders including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and myasthenia gravis (MG). This combination is currently under clinical development, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. FDA-approved IndicationsVeopoz is a prescription medicine used to treat:Adults and children 1 year of age and older with a disease called CD55-deficient protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), also known as CHAPLE disease.It is not known if Veopoz is safe and effective in children younger than 1 year of age.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWhat is the most important information I should know about VEOPOZ?VEOPOZ is a medicine that affects your immune system and can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections.VEOPOZ increases your chance of getting serious and life-threatening meningococcal infections that may quickly become life-threatening and cause death if not recognized and treated early.You must receive meningococcal vaccines at least 2 weeks before your first dose of VEOPOZ if you have not already had these vaccines.If you had a meningococcal vaccine in the past, you might need additional vaccination before starting VEOPOZ. Your healthcare provider will decide if you need additional meningococcal vaccination.If your healthcare provider decides that urgent treatment with VEOPOZ is needed, and your meningococcal vaccines are not up-to-date, you should receive meningococcal vaccination as soon as possible. You should also receive antibiotics.Meningococcal vaccines reduce the risk of meningococcal infection but do not prevent all meningococcal infections. Call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical care right away if you get any of these signs and symptoms of a meningococcal infection:headache with nausea or vomitingheadache with a stiff neck or stiff backfever and a rashmuscle aches with flu-like symptomsheadache and feverfeverconfusioneyes sensitive to lightYour healthcare provider will give you a Patient Safety Card about the symptoms of meningococcal, or other infection. Carry it with you at all times during treatment and for 3 months after your last VEOPOZ dose. Your risk of meningococcal infection may continue for several weeks after your last dose of VEOPOZ. It is important to show this card to any healthcare provider who treats you. This will help them diagnose and treat you quickly.VEOPOZ may also increase the risk of other types of serious bacterial infections.People who take VEOPOZ may have an increased risk of getting infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.Certain people may also have an increased risk of bacterial infection including gonorrhea infection. Talk to your healthcare provider to find out if you are at risk of gonorrhea infection, about gonorrhea prevention, and regular testing.Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any new signs or symptoms of infection.Do not receive VEOPOZ if you have a meningococcal infection.Before you receive VEOPOZ, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have an infection or fever, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if VEOPOZ will harm your unborn baby or if it passes into your breast milk. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby during treatment with VEOPOZ.Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

REGN announced that the European Medicines Agency accepted to review the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for its pipeline candidate odronextamab.Odronextamab is an investigational CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody designed to bridge CD20 on cancer cells with CD3-expressing T-cells to facilitate local T-cell activation and cancer-cell killing.The MAA is seeking approval of the candidate to treat adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) or R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who have progressed after at least two prior systemic therapies.The MAA is supported by data from a phase I and pivotal phase II study, ELM-1 and ELM-2, evaluating odronextamab in FL and DLBCL.The regulatory body in the EU had earlier granted Orphan Drug Designation to odronextamab for FL and DLBCL.Per the release, FL and DLBCL are the two most common subtypes of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). FL is a slow-growing subtype, with patients often relapsing within five years. DLBCL is an aggressive subtype, with up to 50% of high-risk patients experiencing progression after first-line treatment (e.g., relapsing or refractory to treatment). With the progress of these blood cancers, it is difficult to treat patients, especially in the third-line setting and beyond, leaving patients with few treatment options.Currently, Regeneron is conducting a broad phase III program to evaluate odronextamab in earlier lines of therapy and additional B-NHLs.Regeneron is looking to solidify its presence in the lucrative oncology space. Its portfolio already includes an approved PD-1 inhibitor, Libtayo, which is approved to treat people with a type of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma that has spread or cannot be cured by surgery or radiation.It is also approved to treat certain people with a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma and adults with non-small cell lung cancer.Story continuesThe company is also evaluating multiple CD28 costimulatory bispecific antibodies, including PSMAxCD28, EGFRxCD28, MUC16xCD28 and CD22xCD28, in ongoing phase I studies in a variety of tumor settings in combination with Libtayo or in combination with corresponding CD3 bispecifics.Another pipeline candidate, linvoseltamab, a bispecific antibody targeting BCMA and CD3, is being evaluated in patients with heavily pre-treated, relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.Regeneron’s shares have gained 10.4% so far this year against the industry’s decline of 13.9%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research REGN is looking to diversify its revenue base, with lead drug Eylea facing stiff competition. Eylea sales have been under pressure in the last couple of quarters due to competition from Roche’s Vabysmo and sale deductions.Earlier in the month, the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter 2023 results even though lead drug Eylea’s sales declined.Nevertheless, the asthma drug Dupixent, for which the company has a collaboration with Sanofi SNY, maintained its stellar performance, driven by continued strong demand in the approved indications, atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis.We note that Sanofi records global net product sales of Dupixent and Kevzara, while Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with global sales of both drugs.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderRegeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.26bUS$7.04bUS$7.11bUS$7.58bUS$7.94bUS$8.25bUS$8.53bUS$8.79bUS$9.03bUS$9.26bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.69%Est @ 3.92%Est @ 3.39%Est @ 3.02%Est @ 2.76%Est @ 2.58% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$5.8kUS$6.1kUS$5.7kUS$5.7kUS$5.5kUS$5.3kUS$5.1kUS$4.9kUS$4.7kUS$4.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$53bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$9.3b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.2%) = US$175bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$175b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$85bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$138b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$224, the company appears about fair value at a 1.0% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Union Pacific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.079. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Union PacificStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Transportation market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Union Pacific, we've put together three important elements you should further research:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Yet, declining COVID-19 testing sales have acted as a dampener. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Quest Diagnostics is benefiting from strong volume growth across its base business (which refers to testing volumes, excluding COVID-19 testing).The collaborations with health plans, hospitals and physicians have aided the company amid the elevated demand for services, which reflects continued return to care. With the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reducing over the past few quarters, the company is making substantial progress in improving the profitability of the base business compared to the pandemic-laden phase up to the first half of 2022.Across Physician Lab Services, a large number of strategic partnerships with health plans involve value-based arrangements, which are leading to faster growth and share gains than traditional relationships. These arrangements make Quest Diagnostics well-positioned to be a more strategic partner with health plans, cooperating on leakage, shared savings and redirection programs. In addition, the recent acquisition of NewYork-Presbyterian's outreach assets also added to the volume growth from physicians.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated PriceQuest Diagnostics Incorporated PriceQuest Diagnostics Incorporated price | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated QuoteMeanwhile, Quest Diagnostics’ highly specialized Advanced Diagnostics services are gaining traction. Within this, the QuestAD-Detect Alzheimer's blood test is adding to Neurology’s growth trends, fortifying the company’s position in the rapidly evolving Alzheimer’s landscape. The AD-Detect portfolio enables the early assessment of Alzheimer's risk, along with the monitoring of the progression.  The test, currently available to physicians across the United States, equally holds the potential to witness strong customer demand.In addition, Quest Diagnostics continues to witness growth momentum in the cardiometabolic, endocrinology, infectious disease and carrier and prenatal genetic screening services.Story continuesOn the flip side, Quest Diagnostics posted second-quarter 2023 results, wherein the top line reflected a nearly 88% drop in COVID-19 testing revenues. Citing this reason, Diagnostic Information Services reported lower contributions in the quarter despite strong growth in the base business.The adjusted operating income also bore the brunt, resulting in a 104-basis point contraction. In its updated guidance for the full year, Quest Diagnostics anticipates delivering approximately $200 million from COVID-19 testing revenues.The company’s solvency level remains a concern. As of Jun 30, 2023, the long-term debt was $3.78 million, while the cash and cash equivalent balance was only $126 million. The current portion of the debt was also much higher at $518 million.Pressure on volume, owing to a difficult macroeconomic situation and pricing, constitutes the primary risk for Quest Diagnostics. Although total volumes measured by the number of requisitions grew a mere 0.2% in the second quarter, revenues per requisition declined 4.9% year over year due to lower COVID-19 molecular testing volumes.Shares of DGX have dropped 10.7% in the past six months compared with the industry's 4.4% decline.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, Align Technologies ALGN and SiBone SIBN, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems How Fast Is Cisco Systems Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Cisco Systems managed to grow EPS by 5.5% per year, over three years. This may not be setting the world alight, but it does show that EPS is on the upwards trend.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. EBIT margins for Cisco Systems remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 11% to US$57b. That's progress.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. With a whopping US$81m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.Story continuesDoes Cisco Systems Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One positive for Cisco Systems is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if Cisco Systems is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

Cisco Systems has gained 14.9% since the start of the year compared to the 33.3% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 16.1% return for the Zacks Computer - Networking industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on August 16, 2023, Cisco reported EPS of $1.14 versus consensus estimate of $1.06 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1.04%.For the current fiscal year, Cisco is expected to post earnings of $4.04 per share on $57.8 billion in revenues. This represents a 3.86% change in EPS on a 1.41% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.24 per share on $59.15 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 4.98% and 2.33%, respectively.Valuation MetricsCisco may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Cisco has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and F, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 13.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 15.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 14.1X versus its peer group's average of 12.3X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.94. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Cisco currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Cisco passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Cisco shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does CSCO Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of CSCO have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry?
