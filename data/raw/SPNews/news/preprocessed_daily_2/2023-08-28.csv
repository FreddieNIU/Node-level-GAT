(NYSE:AYI) Suggests It's 21% Undervalued",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-acuity-brands-inc-125152500.html,1693140712,STORY,['AYI'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Acuity Brands is US$200 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$158 suggests Acuity Brands is potentially 21% undervalued Analyst price target for AYI is US$183 which is 8.8% below our fair value estimateHow far off is Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE:AYI) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Acuity Brands The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$461.5mUS$461.7mUS$434.4mUS$419.2mUS$411.6mUS$409.1mUS$410.0mUS$413.2mUS$418.2mUS$424.4mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x3Est @ -5.92%Est @ -3.50%Est @ -1.80%Est @ -0.62%Est @ 0.21%Est @ 0.79%Est @ 1.20%Est @ 1.49% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$427US$395US$344US$307US$278US$256US$237US$221US$207US$194(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.9bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$424m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.2%) = US$7.2bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$7.2b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$3.3bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$6.2b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$158, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 21% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Acuity Brands as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.196. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Acuity BrandsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Electrical industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electrical market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Acuity Brands, we've compiled three further aspects you should consider:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific What Is Thermo Fisher Scientific's Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of July 2023 Thermo Fisher Scientific had US$33.8b of debt, an increase on US$30.1b, over one year. However, it does have US$3.13b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$30.7b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Thermo Fisher Scientific's LiabilitiesWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Thermo Fisher Scientific had liabilities of US$14.1b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$36.1b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$3.13b and US$9.49b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$37.6b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Story continuesSince publicly traded Thermo Fisher Scientific shares are worth a very impressive total of US$211.9b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Thermo Fisher Scientific's net debt is 2.9 times its EBITDA, which is a significant but still reasonable amount of leverage. But its EBIT was about 14.4 times its interest expense, implying the company isn't really paying a high cost to maintain that level of debt. Even were the low cost to prove unsustainable, that is a good sign. Shareholders should be aware that Thermo Fisher Scientific's EBIT was down 27% last year. If that earnings trend continues then paying off its debt will be about as easy as herding cats on to a roller coaster. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Thermo Fisher Scientific can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Thermo Fisher Scientific produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 73% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewBased on what we've seen Thermo Fisher Scientific is not finding it easy, given its EBIT growth rate, but the other factors we considered give us cause to be optimistic. There's no doubt that its ability to to cover its interest expense with its EBIT is pretty flash. Looking at all this data makes us feel a little cautious about Thermo Fisher Scientific's debt levels. While we appreciate debt can enhance returns on equity, we'd suggest that shareholders keep close watch on its debt levels, lest they increase. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example - Thermo Fisher Scientific has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

To get news like this delivered straight to your inbox, click here.It’s been a rough month for high-growth tech stocks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index has fallen 6% since July, and many of its constituents are down even more. Fast-growing moonshots from Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) to electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have lost close to 20% of their market values in less than a month.That’s because investors have been pivoting into safer stocks. Over the past month, some of the top performers have included pharma company Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) (up 20%), energy company APA (NASDAQ:APA) (up 16%), and telecom firm Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) (up 9%).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThese moves are reflected in fund flow data.In the past week alone, investors have unloaded $4.2 billion of the popular Nasdaq-100 ETF Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), making it the most sold exchange-traded fund in the world.Meanwhile, blue-chip ETFs are gaining ground. During the same period, ETF inflows went into S&amp;P 500 indices and the iShares MSCI USA Min Vol ETF (BATS:USMV) – an index tracker that seeks to reduce volatility.Bar chart of top bought and sold etfs in August 2023Our writers at InvestorPlace.com, our free news site, have also pivoted to recommending shares of safer stocks, especially firms that will thrive in a market pullback.With investor sentiment suddenly taking a downwards turn, here are the five under-$40 safe stocks our writers and analysts are recommending this week…5 Safe Stocks Under $40 to Buy Immediately: Pfizer (PFE)Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.comShares of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) fell 30% this year as investors pivoted away from the Covid-19 winner. Prices of the pharma giant now sit below their pre-pandemic levelsInvestorPlace.com writer Jeremy Flint sees this as a perfect opportunity to buy in.Here’s from his recent update:Pfizer remains focused on the future, with a robust pipeline ensuring a steady stream of revenue. Its production and distribution networks also ensure the company can compete against generics, threatening its bottom line. Analysts are just as bullish on Pfizer, with estimates indicating PFE is nearly 35% undervalued today. The company’s growing revenue, profits, and 4% dividend yield also make Pfizer perfect for undervalued blue-chip seekers.Story continuesEssentially, bearish investors have become overly focused on Pfizer’s declining sales of Comirnaty and Paxlovid – two Covid-19 treatments with plummeting demand. To these skeptics, Pfizer has become the next Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) – a company that became reliant on therapies for a single disease. It’s a high-risk strategy that can quickly fall apart once that disease ebbs. (Gilead still trades 32% below its 2015 high).But Pfizer is no one-trick pony. The New York-based company has dozens of other high-performing treatments on the market, and owns a pipeline with several potential blockbusters in the making. Its treatments for respiratory disease, migraines, and blood cancers could be worth $1 billion or more.Pfizer’s size also gives it significant advantages in the pharma industry. According to data from Thomson Reuters, the company outspends all but two competitors in research and development (R&amp;D). Its sales team is also one of the most efficient in the industry, with overheads consuming less than 17% of the company’s revenues.That makes Pfizer’s $35 stock an unusual outlier in its industry. Shares currently trade at 10X forward earnings, a level that probably won’t last long.2. Intel (INTC)Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMany investors mistakenly view Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as a risky turnaround. The company’s failure to keep up with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) has left the Silicon Valley pioneer a generation behind in chip technology. Intel’s R&amp;D bosses are now trying to leapfrog to 1.8-nanometer technology, a risky strategy that might not pay off.Yet, Intel remains the dominant player in CPU and server chips.The company has increased its share of the CPU market by 6.4% to 82.7% this year and has been aggressively defending its server business from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).Analysts expect Intel to generate $20 billion in operating cash in 2024, a 32% increase from last year’s figures.This week, Larry Ramer from InvestorPlace.com joins top analyst Eric Fry and me in recommending Intel, a company that Eric calls “the next trillion-dollar stock.”Here’s from Ramer:Intel looks poised to get strong boosts from multiple, powerful trends. Specifically, the company is well-positioned to be lifted by the increased demand for PCs and by its AI chips…The company is also building a large semiconductor factory in Arizona, and will get subsidies for its chip factories from Washington and the EU. Further, Nvidia has expressed interest in having Intel build its chips.Intel is far safer of a stock than people realize.Artificial intelligence servers still require powerful CPUs that Intel produces. And even Intel’s higher-cost fabrication business will soon become an asset. Governments are waking up to the risks of outsourcing advanced chipmaking and are pouring taxpayer money into homegrown players. Even Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) might use Intel to produce its chips someday.Eric just released a presentation on how the stage is set for AI once again. Only this time, we’re on the verge of seeing an AI panic unlike anything you could ever imagine. Watch Eric share his 1,000% AI blueprint for turning the coming panic into 1,000% profit potential in the days ahead.3. SoFi Technologies (SOFI)the Social Finance (SoFi stock) logo is displayed on a smartphone.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comShares of SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) have pulled back in recent weeks, despite the firm announcing a “beat-and-raise” quarter. Q2 earnings came in well ahead of expectations, and the fintech firm raised its full-year 2023 revenue guidance to $2 billion of adjusted net revenue.It’s why top InvestorPlace.com analyst Louis Navellier and his team now sees SoFi’s $8 share price a golden opportunity to buy in. They note that the “neobank” likely remains on track to achieve GAAP profitability by Q4.To see more about Louis’ most recent presentation, click here.“Although it is far from certain how this stock will perform in the near-term as the long-term growth potential of this financial services industry disruptor remains intact, the chances of higher prices for shares down the road remain very strong.”Fundamentally, SoFi is a financial institution that uses student loans as a loss leader to access potential customers. Shares sold off in 2022 as investors wondered whether the company could convert enough borrowers into higher-margin products to survive.This year’s results have shown the answer is “yes.” On July 31, SoFi revealed the number of checking and savings customers rose 47% year over year, vastly outpacing the 6% growth in student loans. Rising interest rates would further push SoFi’s net interest up 477% year over year.The company also gets a B grade in Louis’ Portfolio Grader, ranking the company above traditional banks, from C-grade Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) to D-grade Citigroup (NYSE:C).To see more how Louis uses his AI-powered Portfolio Grader to the right time to buy the best blue chips, click here.4. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy StatusSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comAt first glance, shares of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) look unexciting at best. The world’s largest copper miner will generate only $1.55 earnings per share this year, a 35% decline from 2022. Falling copper prices and sagging Chinese demand have pushed share prices under $40.But Eric sees significant opportunities for this blue-chip miner. This week at InvestorPlace.com, he notes how Freeport is quickly becoming a top user of artificial intelligence:The terms “copper miner” and “artificial intelligence” do not obviously relate to one another. But in the case of Freeport, they do.Freeport has been using a machine-learning model at its Bagdad copper mine in Arizona to boost production. This model uses data from sensors around the mine to “tailor” the ore-processing method to each of the seven distinct types of ore that come from the mine.Because of the company’s success with AI at Bagdad, it is rolling out the technology across several other mines and expects to increase its annual copper production by a hefty 5% “with very little capital investment.”The company is also a beneficiary of the EV revolution. Each new plug-in vehicle uses roughly 4X more copper than gas-powered ones, and the International Copper Association estimates that EV demand will add 1 million tons of annual demand by 2027. Copper futures reflect this reality, with forward prices trading at a 20-year high relative to spot prices.That means Freeport could return to 2021-level profits by 2025, sending shares well into the $50 range.U.S. Bancorp (USB)The logo for U.S. Bancorp's U.S. Bank is displayed on the side of a building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comFinally, Tyrik Torres highlights U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) this week at InvestorPlace.com as a top safe stock to buy the dip.U.S. Bancorp has been one of the most consistent performers among U.S. banks, delivering superior profitability and efficiency ratios throughout the years. In the second quarter of 2023, the bank reported a net income of $1.5 billion.While U.S. Bancorp’s shares are down 9.5% year-to-date, the stock remains undervalued. U.S. Bancorp is trading at around 9.3 times forward earnings. The bank also offers an attractive dividend yield of 4.87%.Put another way, U.S. Bancorp is one of the most profitable regional banks in America.The company generates 11% return on equity, and Wall Street analysts expect the firm to produce $6.8 billion in net income this year, a 3% increase from 2022.The bank is also surprisingly safe, thanks to a focus on conservative underwriting and diversified business lines. Quarter net charge-offs peaked at 2.5% during the 2007-08 financial crisis, far lower than the 3%-plus rates that others saw. Meanwhile, the company’s highly efficient non-banking businesses bring in a steady stream of profits. Payment services alone accounts for over a quarter of corporate profits.That makes U.S. Bancorp’s recent drawdown an attractive opportunity to buy the dip. Shares have not yet fully recovered from this year’s regional banking crisis, and shares trade at only 1.1X book value – a level that suggests at least a 20% near-term upside, relative to returns.The 2023 Quality DiscountOrdinarily, nice things are expensive. People pay more for first-class flights… luxury cars… designer handbags… you name it.But what if high-quality items suddenly became cheap?We’d be lining out the door at the Porche dealership!That exact opportunity is now happening in the U.S. stock market. High-quality firms like U.S. Bancorp are trading at near book value while lower-returning ones like Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) are going for a higher 1.4X multiple.The story is the same no matter where you look. Earlier this week, Vietnamese electric vehicle startup VinFast Auto (NASDAQ:VFS) became worth more than Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) combined, despite selling only 7,400 vehicles in 2022. MotorTrend called the VinFast VF8 a project that would take “cubic dollars to fix” after basic functions like climate control and parking brakes failed to work properly.There’s no hold function, so you’d better keep Creep mode engaged so it’s always sending power to the motors. Disable Creep, and the car will roll away in gear.Meanwhile, blue chips like Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) are selling for less than 4X forward earnings.In a topsy-turvy market like this, it’s no wonder investors are taking profits in expensive companies and moving into far safer bets.As of this writing, Tom Yeung held a LONG position in GM.

8,0babf026-8ee3-3af3-9d73-7da63a025b52,CTAS,2023-08-28,"If EPS Growth Is Important To You, Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) Presents An Opportunity",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eps-growth-important-cintas-nasdaq-130026980.html,1693141226,STORY,['CTAS'],"[For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Cintas Cintas' Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Cintas managed to grow EPS by 16% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Our analysis has highlighted that Cintas' revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. While we note Cintas achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 12% to US$8.8b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Cintas?Story continuesAre Cintas Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$50b company like Cintas. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$7.6b. Coming in at 15% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. Very encouraging.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Cintas, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$12m.Cintas offered total compensation worth US$7.8m to its CEO in the year to May 2022. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Is Cintas Worth Keeping An Eye On?One important encouraging feature of Cintas is that it is growing profits. The growth of EPS may be the eye-catching headline for Cintas, but there's more to bring joy for shareholders. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, you'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Cintas   you should know about.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want. But if you prefer to focus on stocks that have demonstrated insider buying, here is a list of companies with insider buying in the last three months.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

""However, over the long term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our Data Center GPUs to China, if implemented, will result in a permanent loss and opportunity for the US industry to compete and lead in one of the world's largest markets.""China represents a significant chunk of Nvidia's data center business: 20% to 25%, depending on the quarter.The Biden administration is reportedly eyeing new curbs on China's ability to access critical technology, and that would likely involve restricting the sale of the high-end chips Nvidia is selling to power new AI platforms.Nvidia stock is not currently priced for the risk of a huge portion of business drying up, trading on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 61. (Check out these other exorbitant metrics on Nvidia.)But maybe there should be more China risk priced into Nvidia's stock.And this also goes for other large US companies that look to China to supercharge their growth.The Chinese economy is strugglingHong Kong's Hang Seng Index recently slipped into a bear market. The Chinese yuan is hovering around 16-year lows. Markets are looking to China policymakers to offer more rate cuts to stem yawning weakness in the commercial property market.Global investment banks are slashing their GDP growth targets on China to sub 5%.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 Biggest Companies in the World by 2023 Revenue.The biggest companies in the world by 2023 revenue operate within a range of different market sectors, including retail, healthcare, technology, and oil and gas. First, let’s take a look at what some of the biggest companies in the world by revenue are up to.Retail Giants Raise the BarThe retail market ranks among the top industries in the world. Retailing involves buying directly from producers or from wholesalers, exhibiting products for sale either in-stores or online, and now it can sometimes also include delivery. According to Research and Markets, the global retail market was valued at around $26.2 trillion in 2022. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.4% during 2023-2027, propelling the market to reach $37.6 trillion by the end of the forecasted period.E-commerce or online retail remains the fastest growing segment in the retail industry. With the growth of mobile devices and internet services, e-commerce has become a major shopping platform around the world. Companies in this space are working to improve customer satisfaction by offering a wide variety of different and customized items as well as quick deliveries. On July 31, Bloomberg reported that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has announced their plans of doubling the number of US same-day delivery facilities in the coming years. Speedy delivery is of vital importance for the online shopping market leader. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also said that it has delivered more than 1.8 billion units to Prime members in the US with same-day or one-day delivery so far this year, up about four times from the same period in 2019. Unlike bigger warehouses that are located near highways on the outskirts of cities, same-day facilities are smaller and closer to major population centers and allow Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to fulfill, sort, and deliver all from one site to accelerate the entire process of delivering customer packages.Story continuesSome of the biggest companies in the retail and e-commerce markets are also increasingly investing in drones to reduce delivery times and boost profitability. On August 24, Bloomberg reported that Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is teaming up with Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Wing unit and planning its longest drone deliveries yet from two Dallas-area stores. According to the report, the Wing drones will be able to drop off household essentials and food items as far as 6 miles from the store and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) expects to be able to offer drone coverage to around 60,000 homes. This partnership marks a significant expansion in drone service and also shows how serious some of the retail giants are about using robotic aircraft to serve their customers.Companies in Technology, Healthcare, and Energy to Reach New HeightsOn July 19, Bloomberg reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is quietly working on AI tools that could challenge OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Bard and others. The company has built its own framework, known as ‘Ajax’, to create large language models, while also testing a chatbot that some engineers call ‘Apple GPT’. Generative AI has the potential to change how people interact with phones, computers and other technology, and Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices could suffer if the big tech giant doesn’t keep up with AI advancements. According to the report, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has yet to devise a clear strategy for releasing the technology to consumers, but the people familiar with the effort believe that the company is aiming to make a significant AI-related announcement next year.The leading companies in the healthcare industry are working to provide a better quality of care as well as patient satisfaction. It is a massive industry, and it continues to grow as the population swells. According to the latest market research reports, future trends in healthcare include adoption of emerging health-focused technology. On August 11, Reuters reported that Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has provisionally cleared UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (NYSE:UNH) $1.58 billion acquisition of the UK healthcare technology firm EMIS Group plc (LON:EMIS) as it found no competition concerns in the deal between specialist health care tech and software companies. UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) is one of the largest healthcare companies in the world, and it operates in the UK as Optum. It supplies software used by general practitioners within the National Health Service (NHS) to prescribe medicines to patients. Acquisition of EMIS Group plc is expected to bring more advanced technology solutions and capabilities to the NHS, and help general practitioners to improve patient care.On June 1, Reuters reported that with the help of new technologies, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is looking to double the amount of oil produced from its shale holdings in the US over a period of five years. In December 2022, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) had set a goal to produce between 900,000 to 1 million barrels of oil per day in the top US shale field, Permian Basin, by 2027, while also announcing plans for a five-year technology development programme. The post mentions that the CEO of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Darren Woods, said that they currently recover about 10% of shale resources from its operations and that a lot of oil is still being left in the ground. Developing new technology will help Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) better identify acquisition targets as well as keep the fracks open better in order to boost oil flow and significantly improve recovery.Now that we've discussed what some of the leading companies in some of the biggest industries are up to, let's take a look at the 30 biggest companies in the world by revenue as of 2023.30 Biggest Companies in the World by 2023 RevenueMethodologyIn this article, we have listed the 30 biggest companies in the world by 2023 revenue.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the Top 5 Largest Timber Exporting Countries in the World.Timber refers to wood fiber which is specifically used for building structures. A stage in wood production where wood can produce a minimum dimensional size can be classified as timber. Thus, processed beams and planks are timber. It is also referred to as lumber in the United States and Canada.Timber can be divided into hardwood and softwood. Hardwood comes from an angiosperm tree. The timber obtained from hardwood trees is generally dense and heavy as these trees grow slower and take almost 150 years to harvest. Examples of hardwoods include walnut, ash maple, and oak. On the contrary, softwood timber is derived from gymnosperm and this timber is lightweight since it grows faster and becomes ready to harvest in almost 40 years. Softwood timber includes cedars, spruces, firs, and pines.The Timber IndustryThe timber industry is an important part of the global wood market. Timber is any wood that is sewn into planks and beams. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the sawn wood market is currently valued at $751.77 million and is expected to grow to $780 million in 2028 at a compound annual growth rate of 0.74%.Asia Pacific serves to dominate the timber market by its high market share. The high market share is due to increased incomes, urbanization, and population growth. The timber consumption rates are high, especially in countries like China. China is one of the world’s largest importers of sawn wood. This can be attributed to the Chinese furniture market. The main producers of timber in the APAC region include countries like India, Malaysia, and Vietnam.The fastest growing region around the world is North America which is expected to grow at a high compound annual growth rate till 2028. However, Latin America and Middle East Africa have low market shares.Story continuesIn another report by Fact.MR, it was reported that Europe is the leading manufacturer of sawn timber. This region is also following green building codes so they consume wood as a sustainable option in buildings, thereby decreasing carbon footprint.Noteworthy Names in the Timber IndustrySome of the known timber market players in the United States include UFP Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:UFPI), Boise Cascade Company (NYSE:BCC), Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY), and Jewett Cameron Trading Co (NASDAQ:JCTCF).UFP Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:UFPI) is a Michigan-based company that started off as a lumber supplier for manufacturing houses. Now, it operates in retail, packaging, and construction segments. It supplies wood and non-wood composites in Asia, North America, Australia, and Europe. On August 22, Business Wire reported that UFP Packaging, a subsidiary of UFP Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:UFPI), will be launching its packaging solutions in the form of wood pallets, wooden crates, and even customized label packaging at its Las Vegas' PACK Expo that will be held in the coming month of September on September 11-13. PACK Expo is an event conducted for suppliers of packaging to showcase their solutions for different industries.Boise Cascade Company (NYSE:BCC) is another leading name in the North American lumber industry. It produces lumber, panels, and engineered wood products for the residential and construction markets. On August 23, the company reported that it would be acquiring Brockway-Smith, a distributor of millwork and doors. Since Boise Cascade Company (NYSE:BCC) also specializes in wood mill-produced materials for construction, the two firms tend to be of similar nature. Commenting on this upcoming acquisition, Jeff Strom, Executive Vice President, Building Materials Distribution, said:“BROSCO is a long-standing industry leader in the Northeast region known for high-capacity manufacturing, quality artisanship, and a loyal customer base. This acquisition furthers our strategy to expand our millwork business. We are excited to bring this outstanding team on board.”Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY) is one of the largest wood product manufacturers. It owns many hectares of forests in the United States and works as a real estate investment trust. On July 27, the company reported its financial performance for the second quarter of 2023, hoping to maintain its financial position after acquiring 22,000 acres of timberland in Mississippi, US. On August 22, MSN reported that a former Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY) building in Everett which used to hold administration offices for the company, was transformed into a coffee and cocktail house. Furthermore, the original woodwork in the building was maintained and QR codes were installed for customers to learn more about the building's history.Based in Oregon, Jewett Cameron Trading Co (NASDAQ:JCTCF) manufactures and distributes wood products. It operates in the US, Canada, Europe, Mexico, and Asia Pacific through three segments. The first segment, Industrial Wood Products supplies industrial wood. The Pet, Fencing and Other segment engages in producing fencing and pet supplies. Furthermore, the company also distributes seeds for agriculture through its Seed Processing and Sales segment. On July 13, the company reported results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. It made $18.9 million in revenue as compared to last year’s $20.9 million. Elaborating on the decline in sales for the third quarter of 2023, here is what the CEO, Chad Summers, said:“The winter weather which covered much of the US into April had a negative effect on our 3rd quarter sales, as many of our customers delayed, and then reduced, purchases of our outdoor products”Jewett Cameron Trading Co (NASDAQ:JCTCF) has also decided to wrap up its seed segment by the end of 2023.Recent Trends and ChallengesThe timber industry has given rise to the trend of low-carbon constructions. Timber is considered to be less carbon-intensive and hence it plays a significant role in energy efficiency. Thus, the carbon footprints of buildings are being reduced. Mass timber is being consumed for this purpose. An example of this emerging trend is Walmart Inc.'s (NYSE:WMT) Bentonville-based home office which will be launched by 2025. In this regard,  Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) reported that the new home office will comprise 12 buildings in a 2.4 million square feet of mass timber construction. For this purpose, 1.7 million cubic feet of lumber is being locally sourced by Walmart Inc.(NYSE:WMT).The demand for the timber market keeps on increasing. An increase in income has led to a rise in the consumption of timber since it implies more money spent on housing and building. Furthermore, urbanization and high population growth in countries around the world have also led to an increase in the demand for timber. Flooring, fencing, furniture making, and construction also require timber which further boosts this market. Sawn timber is also being used in the production of pallets. These pallets are utilized for packaging.However, this industry is subject to concerns related to deforestation and its impact on biodiversity. This is evident from the New South Wales' situation regarding the timber market. On August 26, MSN reported that bans on logging are to be imposed in surrounding areas like Victoria and Western Australia. Hence, the timber workers in New South Wales are worried about their future. A Great Koala National Park has also been announced by the government in the thick forests of the region. Only a minor portion of the native forests is available for timber harvesting. In this condition, the task at hand is to accommodate the Koalas in a natural habitat while preserving the timber market which fuels the economy of New South Wales.Now that we have taken a look at the timber industry and its current situation, we can move to the top 20 largest timber exporting countries.Top 20 Largest Timber Exporting Countries in the WorldJosef Hanus/Shutterstock.comMethodologyIn order to find out the top 20 largest timber exporting countries in the world, we sourced data from the FAO Forestry Production and Trade Database. We carried out extensive research to see how timber is represented in this database. FAO reports that it “segregates timber products into 5 general categories: roundwood, sawnwood and sleepers, wood-based panels, wood pulp, paper and paperboard”. Here, roundwood includes both industrial roundwood and non-industrial roundwood.Furthermore, non-industrial roundwood is excluded from the trade data on FAO as it has a low value per unit of volume. Thus, excluding non-industrial roundwood, we considered the categories of industrial roundwood, sawnwood and sleepers, wood-based panels, wood pulp, paper and paperboard to define ‘timber’. We used export volume as of 2021 as a metric. Please note that ‘timber’ represents the above categories whenever mentioned in this article. We added the dollar value of exports for all timber categories to find the total export volume, as quoted in the rankings. Finally, we ranked the top 20 largest timber exporting countries in ascending order of the dollar value of their exports, as follows:Top 20 Largest Timber Exporting Countries in the World20.

That's even as Tehran and Washington work toward a trade of billions of dollars in frozen Iranian assets in South Korea for the release of five Iranian-Americans held in Tehran.Iran has been trying to evade sanctions and continue selling its oil abroad, while the U.S. and its allies have been seizing cargoes since 2019 after the country’s nuclear deal allowing the trade collapsed.Speaking to journalists Monday, Kanaani said Tehran had summoned the chargé d’affaires of the Swiss Embassy in Iran to express a “strong objection” over the U.S seizing the oil. Switzerland has looked out for America's interests in Iran since the 1979 U.S. Embassy hostage crisis.Kanaani's comments also acknowledged the oil was Iranian.“The subject of the seizure of an Iranian oil consignment by the U.S. ... is a completely unproductive action,"" Kanaani said. He said the U.S. government was on the one hand expressing interest in direct talks to pave the way for a renewed nuclear deal and on the other was imposing new sanctions and seizing oil.The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The saga over the Suez Rajan began in February 2022, when the group United Against Nuclear Iran said it suspected the tanker carried oil from Iran’s Khargh Island, its main oil distribution terminal in the Persian Gulf.For months, the ship sat in the South China Sea off the northeast coast of Singapore before suddenly sailing for the Gulf of Mexico without explanation. Analysts believe the vessel’s cargo likely has been seized by American officials, though there still were no public court documents Monday involving the oil.Story continuesOn Aug. 20, the Suez Rajan began transferring its oil to the tanker MR Euphrates, ship-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed. On Monday, data showed the MR Euphrates moored in Houston at a major oil terminal, likely preparing to discharge the crude it carried from the Suez Rajan.The Los Angeles-based private equity firm Oaktree Capital Management had owned the Suez Rajan until late May, when it was taken over the Greek-based firm Empire Navigation. The MR Euphrates also is owned by Empire, which did not respond to a request for comment Monday.Since the Suez Rajan headed for America, Iran has seized two tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, including one with cargo for U.S. oil major Chevron Corp. In July, the top commander of the Revolutionary Guard’s naval arm threatened further action against anyone offloading the Suez Rajan, with state media linking the recent seizures to the cargo’s fate.Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers saw it regain the ability to sell oil openly on the international market. But in 2018, then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord and re-imposed American sanctions. That slammed the door on much of Iran’s lucrative crude oil trade, a major engine for its economy and its government. It also began a cat-and-mouse hunt for Iranian oil cargo — as well as series of escalating attacks attributed to Iran since 2019.The delay in offloading the Suez Rajan’s cargo had become a political issue as well for the Biden administration as the ship had sat for months in the Gulf of Mexico, possibly due to companies being worried about the threat from Iran.The U.S. Navy has increased its presence steadily in recent weeks in the Mideast, sending the troop-and-aircraft-carrying USS Bataan through the Strait of Hormuz and considering putting armed personnel on commercial ships traveling through the strait to stop Iran from seizing additional ships.___Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.]"

20,3688b264-7e41-330d-81a5-4df3ed2ee08a,OMC,2023-08-28,Omnicom Group (NYSE:OMC) Has Announced A Dividend Of $0.70,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/omnicom-group-nyse-omc-announced-101355446.html,1693217635,STORY,['OMC'],"[The board of Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.70 per share on the 12th of October. This makes the dividend yield 3.5%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. View our latest analysis for Omnicom Group Omnicom Group's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. The last dividend was quite easily covered by Omnicom Group's earnings. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 19.9%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 35% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendOmnicom Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.20, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.80. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.8% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.The Dividend Has Growth PotentialInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. We are encouraged to see that Omnicom Group has grown earnings per share at 7.1% per year over the past five years. The company is paying a reasonable amount of earnings to shareholders, and is growing earnings at a decent rate so we think it could be a decent dividend stock.Omnicom Group Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Omnicom Group might even raise payments in the future. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Just as an example, we've come across 2 warning signs for Omnicom Group you should be aware of, and 1 of them doesn't sit too well with us.

To see the top 5 stocks in this list click Ken Fisher's Top 5 Growth Stock Picks.Markets struggled to find a direction on August 25 following mixed comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. While Powell acknowledged that inflation came down from its peak levels, he’s still concerned about high consumer spending and believes further signs of strong activity and economic growth could force the central bank to increase interest rates. Despite this clear stance, some analysts and investors still believe stocks will ultimately come out of the woods and the US will not face a full-fledge recession.Billionaire Ken Fisher is one of the strongest voices of optimism in the current scenario. He’s consistently said that markets are overeacting to inflation and rate hikes and stocks will rebound and now is the time to pile into equities. He isn’t alone in this optimism. Gabriela Santos, JPMorgan Asset Management global market strategist, recently said while talking to CNBC that the markets are back to the “normal” period of volatility in equity markets. The analyst said that profit taking, CPI, seasonal effects and other factors could affect stock prices but ultimately she has a constructive view on the stock market.Top Growth Stock Picks of Ken FisherMethodologyFor this article we scanned Ken Fisher’s second quarter of 2023 portfolio and picked top 15 growth stocks the billionaire had stakes in. We gave preference to technology stocks with high PE ratios which also have strong growth catalysts.15. Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER)Ken Fisher's Stake: $400,000,000According to Yahoo Finance, Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER)’s forward PE ratio stands at 81 as of August 25. The ride-hailing company’s revenue in the second quarter jumped 14% on a YoY basis.Ken Fisher’s hedge fund owns a $400 million stake in the company.Story continuesUber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER)’s CEO said the following about the company’s delivery business in Uber’s Q2 earnings call:“…When we look at the Delivery business, we’re actually quite pleased with the trends there. Last quarter, we grew at about 12% constant currency, that accelerated to 14% constant currency. This quarter, certainly New Verticals was a help. But we continue to drive higher frequency as a higher percentage of our bookings come from our members, as we improve the service, as we improve the average delivery times to our consumer as well, and generally basket sizes are positive there. So again, you break down the growth in terms of audience, frequency and price, and all of those are positive factors in terms of our Delivery business. And going forward, we expect growth consistent with what we saw this quarter or accelerating even from this quarter as well, depending on the marketplace, the competitive position and how things shake out.But generally, we’re quite confident of Delivery top-line growth going forward. And we think the penetration in these markets is very low. So, in many of our developed markets there, significant markets there, we’ve wired up anywhere from 20% of restaurants to, call it, 40% of restaurants in a particular market. So, if you think about just all of the inventory out there, these restaurants are in the marketplace. They’ve got loyal clients. They’re servicing their local communities. And we think as we wire them up, then naturally more people want delivery, because it’s another way of staying connected, it’s another way of getting great food whenever you want on a on-demand basis. So, we think that with the very early penetration into the total restaurant in our major markets being, call it, a range of 20% to 40%, we’ve got a long, long runway ahead of us.”14. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Ken Fisher's Stake: $770,458,000Digital workflows and enterprise operations management software company ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) ranks 14th in our list of the top growth stock picks of Ken Fisher. As of the end of the second quarter, Fisher’s hedge fund owns a $770 million stake in the company. Stifel recently downgraded Datadog and said it prefers companies like ServiceNow (NOW), MongoDB (MDB), Snowflake (SNOW) and Dynatrace (DT) in the infrastructure space.During a latest earnings call, ServiceNow’s management talked generative AI and its collaboration with Nvidia.“Our good friend, NVIDIA Co-Founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, joined us at Knowledge ‘23 earlier this year. And Jensen stated the expanded NVIDIA-ServiceNow partnership is really important. Their partnership of choice for enterprise IT. He thinks it’s an exciting growth opportunity for both companies. We agree. We’re in the midst of a dramatic expansion of the software economy. In 2023 alone, IDC says Platform-as-a-Service spending will grow 30%, and Software-as-a-Service applications will grow 17%. When you correlate that to ServiceNow’s platform and our workflow leadership, it’s clear we live in a great neighborhood on a super nice street, and maybe we’re in the best house.With regard to artificial intelligence, especially large language models, ServiceNow strategy has been laser-focused for years. We accelerated that focus with our Element AI acquisition in 2020. Today, by some estimates, Generative AI could boost global GDP by almost $7 trillion. We see unprecedented parallel adoption across consumer and the enterprise. Our platform experts, who have worked for the greatest brands and technology believe this moment is as transformative, if not even more so than the Internet or even the iPhone. But they’re careful to remind me, it’s all about delivering enterprise-grade, domain-specific large language models, which is the core of ServiceNow’s AI strategy. These models will improve the accuracy results, leveraging a customer’s enterprise data in alignment with their business rules, while maintaining the highest ethical standards for data privacy.”13.

To see more such companies, go directly to Ken Fisher's Top 5 Stock Picks.Markets are still in a wait-and-see more as risks of inflationary pressures continue to haunt investors. Many believe the Federal Reserve’s battle against inflation is not over yet and if the central bank caps off its rate-hike spree to soon, chances are that inflation will make a comeback and haunt the economy for years. Amid the stock market rally this year, investors thought the stock market bears were on the retreat as recession warnings were going in the background. But as markets become jittery and pressures in the banking sector and China become visible, bear calls are getting more attention. A Bloomberg report recently cited Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of the Boston-based investment firm Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo, who reiterated his recession warnings. Otterloo said that his earlier recession warning was proven to be wrong because of the AI-led rally. But he believes “it’s perhaps too little too late to save us from a recession.”Many other analysts have been calling the AI-led rally short-lived. They say AI as entered the hype territory and pushed the valuations of tech stocks to dangerously high levels.  There are signs telling that the AI rally is about to end. The same Bloomberg report cited Emmanuel Cau, a strategist at Barclays Plc, who said in a note that the markets are facing a “perfect storm” amid bad news from China, “poor summer liquidity” and rate hikes.What's Behind Ken Fisher's Optimism?Despite the recession warnings, long-term analysts and successful investors like Ken Fisher believe now is the time to take opportunity from market swings. Markets rise and fall and it’s up to investors how they use these swings to their advantage. Billionaire Ken Fisher has been consistently optimistic over the past several months despite rate hikes, inflation, banking crisis and other doom and gloom calls. Other investors like Fisher who like to see their money stay invested in the market and enjoy the compounding effect also have the same stance. But why and how these investors can stay optimistic? A report by Russell Investments takes a look at the importance of “staying invested” in the stock market. The report analyzes stock market data spanning ten years. A hypothetical investment of CAD 100,000 in S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index would surge to $239,816 in ten years assuming that the investor remains invested in all days, including the bad and worst days. On the other hand, if the investor misses on just 10 “best days” the initial investment would surge to $147,184. The report mentions the results of missing other windows of best days, showing how important it is to stay invested in the stock market if ones does not want to miss out on the real gains of market upswings. The report adds:Story continuesStocks have historically outperformed bonds when based on average rolling returns over one, three, five, 10 and 20 years. Just as compelling is the traditional ability of a balanced portfolio to produce positive returns. ... A global balanced portfolio of equities and bonds has not produced a negative return over any five-year rolling period since 1979. The bottom line is that, although there are no guarantees the future will resemble the past, history tends to favour long-term investors.Seen in this perspective, it truly does not matter what happens to the market in the next few weeks. Given that one is invested in the right stocks or ETFs and let the market perform its wonders, short-term volatility should not affect the long-term investment outlook. Let’s see in what stocks billionaire Ken Fisher is invested in in the current environment.Ken Fisher's Top Stock Picks in 2023Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management Our MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Ken Fisher’s second quarter of 2023 portfolio and picked his top 15 holdings.

We are FINTECH investors, and we define Fintech as “anything utilizing technology to improve an established process.” We realize that half of Fintech is financial, but we don’t invest in traditional, credit sensitive banks. Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent.We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow. From our perspective, the perfect example of a FINTECH business is the secularly growing payments industry. Names like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) or Mastercard, that generate revenue and profit per swipe or transaction, without the underlying credit sensitivity or risk associated with that underlying line of credit.”14. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Ken Fisher's Stake: $2 billionAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP) ranks 14th in our list of the top stock picks of Ken Fisher in 2023.

(NYSE:FCX).Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Other top contributors during the quarter were copper producer Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) and health care facilities operator HCA Healthcare. With little fundamental news to report, Freeport-McMoRan’s share price advance in Q4 reflected a rebound in copper prices, driven by the recognition that copper inventories are low relative to historical norms. We believe the company continues to have meaningful price and volume leverage in a copper constrained world.”12.

Oracle has messaged that this business has price-performance advantages as compared to the other infrastructure companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) and appears to be winning business as a result. On the earnings call, management made the case that OCI will play a significant role in the Generative AI workloads which bodes well for continued growth.”11. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Ken Fisher's Stake: $2.4 billionAnother stock that is getting buoyed on the back of the AI boom, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is up about 51% year to date.

The company also introduced some AI product enhancements, which seem to have helped shift the narrative from “AI is going to be bad for Adobe” to “AI is going to be good.” Finally, the company continues to work towards the Figma acquisition.It’s still uncertain whether antitrust regulators will allow this acquisition to close. That said, the stock seems to have been recovering from the initial reaction that the pricey acquisition indicated something more troubling about Adobe’s growth and competitive position. Solid ongoing fundaments have helped dispel that notion. We think it would be a big positive if the acquisition closes, but we remain confident in Adobe’s business even if it doesn’t.”10.

For 30 years, Team Depot associates have worked side by side with non-profits around the United States. Focus areas include spending time with the elderly and activities with at risk youth. Team Depot also improves the homes and lives of veterans and helps communities impacted by natural disasters.During the quarter, Home Depot set a goal for battery-powered products to represent over 85% of outdoor lawn equipment sales in the U.S. and Canada by the end of fiscal 2028. Push lawn mowers and handheld leaf blowers and trimmers will run on rechargeable battery technology instead of gas. This will reduce 2 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually.”9.

The company’s software subscription term-license model differs from the traditional perpetual-license software model in two respects: (1) the software is hosted on centralized servers and delivered over the internet, as opposed to traditional enterprise software that is loaded directly onto customers’ hard drives or servers; and (2) the revenue model is subscription-based, typically charging monthly fees per user as opposed to charging one-time licensing fees. The stock’s strong relative performance followed a strong F4Q23 earnings release that easily beat Street expectations on the top- and bottom-lines. In addition to the beat, management announced a number of initiatives that activist investors have been clamoring for, specifically a halt to large M&amp;A transactions and a focus on operating profitability.”8.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Ken Fisher's Stake: $3 billionWhile Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

This privileged position allows the company to capture value within the semiconductor ecosystem. You can see it in their margins and operating leverage. ASML’s customers are so eager for their products that they are willing to pay upfront, two years before a machine is even delivered! This is a testament to the company’s unrivalled capabilities and the high demand for its unique offerings. It will keep this privileged position as long as it continues to push the frontiers of chip density.ASML announced, this quarter, that their first High-NA machines (costing $200m per machine) are going to start shipping in 2024. This is a new source of its technological moat and earnings for the next decade.

25,02bc9bf3-5d7e-32ce-a27d-c3d4e042032d,SEE,2023-08-28,Sealed Air (NYSE:SEE) Has Announced A Dividend Of $0.20,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sealed-air-nyse-see-announced-101932468.html,1693217972,STORY,['SEE'],"[The board of Sealed Air Corporation (NYSE:SEE) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 22nd of September, with investors receiving $0.20 per share. This payment means that the dividend yield will be 2.3%, which is around the industry average. See our latest analysis for Sealed Air Sealed Air's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. But before making this announcement, Sealed Air's earnings quite easily covered the dividend. However, with more than 75% of free cash flow being paid out to shareholders, future growth could potentially be constrained.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 47.4%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 21% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendSealed Air Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.52 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.80. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 4.4% over that duration. Although we can't deny that the dividend has been remarkably stable in the past, the growth has been pretty muted.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. We are encouraged to see that Sealed Air has grown earnings per share at 21% per year over the past five years. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.In SummaryIn summary, we are pleased with the dividend remaining consistent, and we think there is a good chance of this continuing in the future. However, lack of cash flows makes us wary of the potential for cuts in the dividend's future, even though the dividend is generally looking okay. This looks like it could be a good dividend stock going forward, but we would note that the payout ratio has been at higher levels in the past so it could happen again.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for Sealed Air that investors need to be conscious of moving forward.

The S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq 100 were down 2,1%, 2.0%, and 2.4%, respectively, for the week of Aug. 14-18. Barron’s believes that September could be worse. If the past week is any indication, they could be on to something. Fundstrat analyst Tom Lee thinks August has been its typical mercurial self where gains are hard to come by and that the good times should return soon. Baron’s reported Lee’s comments from his Aug. 18 note to clients:“[T]he month’s declines haven’t shaken Lee’s core bullish thesis. ‘We see this more as ‘it’s August’ rather than the start of a larger rout…we are not in the camp this spills over into a wider selloff. That could happen, but more bad things need to emerge. In fact, there are some signs that we could see the stocks begin to stabilize soon.’”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, if you’re a risk-averse investor, you might want to wait a couple of weeks to see if the markets bottom. In the meantime, a quick screen of S&amp;P 500 stocks down more than 20% over the past month gives bargain-hunting investors 14 stocks to choose from. Here are three undervalued due to their 20%, including one name from three different sectors. Sealed Air (SEE)Source: ShutterstockSealed Air (NYSE:SEE) represents the materials sector. Its stock is down 25% for the past month and 31% year-to-date. Analysts are moderately optimistic about the stock, with 7 of the 15 rating it as Overweight or an outright Buy. It’s target price is $45 which is 31% higher than its current share price. One of the things that I use to assess value is free cash flow yield. If it’s over 8%, it’s definitely value. Between 4% and 8%, it’s reasonable value, if not dirt cheap. In the trailing 12 months ended June 30, its free cash flow was $152 million. Based on an enterprise value of $9.78 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 1.6%, which suggests it’s not cheap.Story continuesBefore you toss the company best known for bubble wrap packaging overboard, consider its historical FCF yield. In 2020, it had a free cash flow of $556 million. Based on an enterprise value of $10.6 billion. At first glance, it appears Sealed Air’s business has deteriorated. And to a certain extent, it has, which is why it’s moving forwqard with SEE 2.0. This revitalization plan should deliver $150 million in annual cost savings by the end of 2025 and a return to its historical earnings and sales growth in 2024. Its stock hasn’t been this low since June 2020. Get ready for a revival in the waning months of 2023 and into 2024.Keysight Technologies (KEYS)An image of waveforms.Source: fantasyform/Shutterstock.comKeysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) represents the tech sector. Its stock is down 23% for the past month and 24% year-to-date. Like Sealed Air, it hasn’t traded this low since 2020.Keysight is a relatively new company by S&amp;P 500 standards, incorporated in 2013. However, its history dates back to 1939 and Hewlett-Packard’s founding by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard. Their first product was an audio oscillator. Electronic measurement was their business.In 1999, Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) was formed to operate HP’s Medical Products and Instrument Group. In 2013, Agilent was split into two pure-play electronic measurement companies. Keysight was the one of the two, going public on November 1, 2014 after separating from Agilent. Agilent shareholders got one share of Keysight for two held by the parent. KEYS stock is up 335% since it began trading in November 2014. Agilent is up 191% over the same period.Shares have lost their mojo recently because the company reported Q3 2023 results on August 18th that included a downward revision of its guidance. It now expects fourth-quarter sales and earnings to decline by 10% and 13%, respectively. Currently trading at 4.16x sales — less than its five-year average of 5.1x — its enterprise value of $22.5 billion is 12.87x its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). That’s lower than it’s been since 2016.ResMed (RMD)ResMed logo on a tablet on a yellow background. RMD stock.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockResMed (NYSE:RMD) represents the healthcare sector. Its stock is down 25% for the past month and 21% year-to-date. Like the other two, it hasn’t traded this low since 2020.Interestingly, ResMed’s business is probably doing the best in terms of top-line growth among the trio, up 23% in Q4 2023 and 18% for all of 2023 to $4.2 billion. However, investors began to abandon the stock after hearing its gross margin (56.5%) and operating margin (29.0%) dropped for the year.    All of its stock losses in 2023 are post-earnings. Investors have rightly or wrongly decided that the contraction of its margins in light of double-digit revenue growth suggests the quality of the sales increase for the maker of sleep apnea equipment is suspect. ResMed CEO Mick Farrell is very confident about the future. He stated in the Q4 2023 conference call:“Patient demand continues to drive increased adoption and utilization of our mask resupply programs, augmenting a steady cadence of new patient setups. We continue to see strong growth in both the U.S. business where provider resupply programs have augmented growth and in our markets outside the U.S. where our consumer outreach and subscription programs are also driving mass replenishment directly with those end user patients.”Of the 24 analysts covering the stock, 18 rate it Overweight or an outright Buy with a $240 median price, 45% higher than its current share price. I see ResMed as the best long-term hold of the trio, although all three should make you money over 3-5 years.    On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

27,6c29377a-67e9-3f74-9c80-0c091c529ddd,MSFT,2023-08-28,Microsoft Insiders Sold US$62m Of Shares Suggesting Hesitancy,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-insiders-sold-us-62m-120030341.html,1693224030,STORY,['MSFT'],"[The fact that multiple Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At MicrosoftOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; CFO, Amy Hood, for US$20m worth of shares, at about US$259 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$323, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 16% of Amy Hood's stake.Microsoft insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Microsoft Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Microsoft. In total, insiders dumped US$17m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Microsoft insiders own about US$786m worth of shares (which is 0.03% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Microsoft Tell Us?Insiders sold Microsoft shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But since Microsoft is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Microsoft and understanding it should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 Biggest Companies in the World by 2023 Revenue.The biggest companies in the world by 2023 revenue operate within a range of different market sectors, including retail, healthcare, technology, and oil and gas. First, let’s take a look at what some of the biggest companies in the world by revenue are up to.Retail Giants Raise the BarThe retail market ranks among the top industries in the world. Retailing involves buying directly from producers or from wholesalers, exhibiting products for sale either in-stores or online, and now it can sometimes also include delivery. According to Research and Markets, the global retail market was valued at around $26.2 trillion in 2022. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.4% during 2023-2027, propelling the market to reach $37.6 trillion by the end of the forecasted period.E-commerce or online retail remains the fastest growing segment in the retail industry. With the growth of mobile devices and internet services, e-commerce has become a major shopping platform around the world. Companies in this space are working to improve customer satisfaction by offering a wide variety of different and customized items as well as quick deliveries. On July 31, Bloomberg reported that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has announced their plans of doubling the number of US same-day delivery facilities in the coming years. Speedy delivery is of vital importance for the online shopping market leader. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also said that it has delivered more than 1.8 billion units to Prime members in the US with same-day or one-day delivery so far this year, up about four times from the same period in 2019. Unlike bigger warehouses that are located near highways on the outskirts of cities, same-day facilities are smaller and closer to major population centers and allow Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to fulfill, sort, and deliver all from one site to accelerate the entire process of delivering customer packages.Story continuesSome of the biggest companies in the retail and e-commerce markets are also increasingly investing in drones to reduce delivery times and boost profitability. On August 24, Bloomberg reported that Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is teaming up with Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Wing unit and planning its longest drone deliveries yet from two Dallas-area stores. According to the report, the Wing drones will be able to drop off household essentials and food items as far as 6 miles from the store and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) expects to be able to offer drone coverage to around 60,000 homes. This partnership marks a significant expansion in drone service and also shows how serious some of the retail giants are about using robotic aircraft to serve their customers.Companies in Technology, Healthcare, and Energy to Reach New HeightsOn July 19, Bloomberg reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is quietly working on AI tools that could challenge OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Bard and others. The company has built its own framework, known as ‘Ajax’, to create large language models, while also testing a chatbot that some engineers call ‘Apple GPT’. Generative AI has the potential to change how people interact with phones, computers and other technology, and Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices could suffer if the big tech giant doesn’t keep up with AI advancements. According to the report, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has yet to devise a clear strategy for releasing the technology to consumers, but the people familiar with the effort believe that the company is aiming to make a significant AI-related announcement next year.The leading companies in the healthcare industry are working to provide a better quality of care as well as patient satisfaction. It is a massive industry, and it continues to grow as the population swells. According to the latest market research reports, future trends in healthcare include adoption of emerging health-focused technology. On August 11, Reuters reported that Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has provisionally cleared UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (NYSE:UNH) $1.58 billion acquisition of the UK healthcare technology firm EMIS Group plc (LON:EMIS) as it found no competition concerns in the deal between specialist health care tech and software companies. UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) is one of the largest healthcare companies in the world, and it operates in the UK as Optum. It supplies software used by general practitioners within the National Health Service (NHS) to prescribe medicines to patients. Acquisition of EMIS Group plc is expected to bring more advanced technology solutions and capabilities to the NHS, and help general practitioners to improve patient care.On June 1, Reuters reported that with the help of new technologies, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is looking to double the amount of oil produced from its shale holdings in the US over a period of five years. In December 2022, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) had set a goal to produce between 900,000 to 1 million barrels of oil per day in the top US shale field, Permian Basin, by 2027, while also announcing plans for a five-year technology development programme. The post mentions that the CEO of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Darren Woods, said that they currently recover about 10% of shale resources from its operations and that a lot of oil is still being left in the ground. Developing new technology will help Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) better identify acquisition targets as well as keep the fracks open better in order to boost oil flow and significantly improve recovery.Now that we've discussed what some of the leading companies in some of the biggest industries are up to, let's take a look at the 30 biggest companies in the world by revenue as of 2023.30 Biggest Companies in the World by 2023 RevenueMethodologyIn this article, we have listed the 30 biggest companies in the world by 2023 revenue.

One lesson from past fights is that these cases can create an opening for a new generation of firms to emerge, even if the government isn’t successful.Take Microsoft (MSFT). The Seattle software and cloud computing giant benefited from a 1969 government case against rival IBM (IBM), which the government eventually dropped after 13 years due to what an assistant attorney general called ""flimsy"" evidence. The litigation had alleged IBM illegally monopolized the market for business computers.Later, between 1998 and 2001, Microsoft found itself hobbled by its own extended antitrust battle with the Justice Department, which resulted in a settlement that opened the door to broader competition in the internet browser software market.Microsoft's Bill Gates at a 1998 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee about whether his company was a monopoly that buried the competition. (Harry Hamburg/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images) (New York Daily News Archive via Getty Images)The settlement — which required Microsoft to design its Windows operating system to interoperate with competing browsers, email clients, media players, and instant messaging software — created an opportunity for Google (GOOG, GOOGL), then a startup, to begin its period of meteoric growth in the 2000s.'These things are highly unpredictable'This scenario may be ripe to repeat itself with a new set of federal and state lawsuits that seek to break up Google, Facebook-owning Meta (META), and possibly Amazon (AMZN).The cases create potential for new tech giants to emerge, but no certain path, said former Federal Communications Commission Chief of Staff Blair Levin.""These things are highly unpredictable,"" said Levin, who is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""I'm pretty sure no one would have predicted that the government's antitrust case against IBM would have produced Microsoft, nor ... that the government's Microsoft antitrust case would have produced Google. But they did.""Assistant Attorney General William Baxter announcing at a news conference in 1982 that a 13-year antitrust case against IBM had been dropped, saying that the case was based on 'flimsy' evidence. (Bettmann Archive) (Bettmann via Getty Images)One reason, Levin said, is that back then the emerging technology wasn't obvious. Microsoft didn't directly compete with IBM, and Google wasn't a direct competitor to Microsoft.Story continues""But what is certain,"" he said, citing the story of 5th century Sicilian tyrant Dionysius, ""is that history demonstrates that a Damocles sword over the big companies can have a positive result.""Rutgers University Law School professor Michael Carrier said even if the suits lead to a breakup of the Big Tech firms, emerging companies could remain hard pressed to compete over the short term with the dominant players' established scale.A small toothbrush business, he explains, could benefit if Amazon is forced to stop selling its own competing toothbrush products alongside its third-party sellers.""On the other hand, I don't see a single company that could replace the entire segment of what Amazon does,"" Carrier said about the retail giant's reach across dozens of markets. The same goes for Meta, he said, because emerging businesses cannot quickly replicate its network of users.That scale might already be compounding competition hurdles for one emerging technology, as the cases make their way through the courts. Unlike the IBM and Microsoft antitrust eras of the past, Levin said, today's emerging technology is obvious: artificial intelligence.And Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon are already spending big on AI.""There is an argument that AI will completely transform the way we do advertising in very scary ways,"" Levin said, ""but nonetheless, if we're going after Google's ad-tracking technology, it's not clear to me what AI does to the value of it.""""Is AI creating new moats? Or, is it creating new attacking vectors?"" he said.The new case against Big TechOne agency in Washington is taking on multiple tech giants at once: the Federal Trade Commission.The FTC is trying to force Meta to split apart Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. A federal case filed in December 2020 alleged the social media giant was illegally monopolizing the personal social networking market.Another recent FTC target was Microsoft. It tried to stop the Windows maker from completing its acquisition of ""Call of Duty"" developer Activision Blizzard (ATVI), before backing away from that attempt.""What the FTC is doing relevant to Al, is adopting a merger policy that will tend to discourage investment in startups,"" said former Justice Department Deputy Attorney General Tad Lipsky. The more the government challenges acquisitions of emerging technologies, the more startup funding dies up, he said, and dominant companies will look to develop technologies in house.The FTC is also reportedly preparing a suit against Amazon over concerns the e-commerce giant is unfairly competing with third-party sellers who use its marketplace.California and Washington, D.C., already sued Amazon over those concerns, arguing that the company illegally forced sellers to hike prices outside of the Amazon platform. The case filed by Washington, D.C., was thrown out by a judge last year, and the California case is ongoing.The FTC's campaign is being led by its 34-year-old chair Lina Khan, who has made taking on Big Tech the cornerstone of her tenure. She rose to prominence after publishing a 2017 article in the Yale Law Journal titled ""Amazon's Antitrust Paradox.""The article argued modern antitrust laws weren't equipped to tackle the tech industry's anticompetitive behavior because they were too focused on pricing as a means of determining consumer harms.FTC chair Lina Khan testifying before a House committee in July. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)Those laws, she argued, needed to be rethought to bring Big Tech companies to heel. Now she is attempting to rein in these companies as chair.It's the 1990s all over againBut the case that most closely resembles the government's attempts to rein in Microsoft during the 1990s targets the company that benefited most from Microsoft's quarter-century-old battle: Google.The Department of Justice and a collection of state attorneys general are suing Google in two consolidated cases launched during President Trump’s administration, alleging the company abuses its market power across search and search advertising to squeeze competition.Those cases go to trial beginning Sept. 12 before the US District Court for the District of Columbia, which has dismissed some of the claims.Multiple groups of state attorneys general are also targeting Google's mobile app distribution dominance, as well as its dominance across the markets for selling and brokering online ads.US Attorney General Merrick Garland speaking at the Justice Department earlier this month. (Bonnie Cash/REUTERS) (Bonnie Cash / reuters)In its case against Google, the DOJ alleges the search and advertising giant is violating the Sherman Antitrust Act — the same law, first effective in 1890, that was at the heart of its case against Microsoft.In its complaint, federal prosecutors claim that Google makes software that can't be deleted and is contractually required by default.They made a similar claim against Microsoft in the 1990s. The DOJ and a group of states said the software giant sustained an illegal monopoly for personal computer (PC) operating systems using contracts with PC manufacturers that required them to exclude competing software.The government’s case zeroed in on Microsoft’s proprietary web browser, Internet Explorer (IE), that it developed to compete with the world’s first browser, Netscape.Instead of selling IE as a browser to run on top of multiple operating systems, Microsoft gave away the browser free of charge on Windows-equipped PCs, which then accounted for more than 90% of the market. Microsoft also made it difficult for users to uninstall IE in favor of an alternate browser.But back then, prosecutors ran into a major hurdle that could pose problems for them today: a presumption that lower, even free, prices are a consumer advantage and not necessarily anticompetitive.One possible outcome of this period, said Lipsky, is that this push to rein in big companies could have the opposite impact that regulators are hoping for. It could make the big companies even more dominant.Venture capital funding for startups could dry up because investors fear the companies they support are not going to be able to be acquired by larger players. And if giants can't complete mergers without protracted litigation, they will simply decide to develop more products in house.Microsoft's arc over the last three decades helps prove that point. After its humbling encounter with the Justice Department in the 1990s, it went on to become a major new player in several industries, including cloud computing and gaming.""I think the fact of the matter is, it will tend to favor the large incumbents,"" Lipsky said.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

""However, over the long term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our Data Center GPUs to China, if implemented, will result in a permanent loss and opportunity for the US industry to compete and lead in one of the world's largest markets.""China represents a significant chunk of Nvidia's data center business: 20% to 25%, depending on the quarter.The Biden administration is reportedly eyeing new curbs on China's ability to access critical technology, and that would likely involve restricting the sale of the high-end chips Nvidia is selling to power new AI platforms.Nvidia stock is not currently priced for the risk of a huge portion of business drying up, trading on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 61. (Check out these other exorbitant metrics on Nvidia.)But maybe there should be more China risk priced into Nvidia's stock.And this also goes for other large US companies that look to China to supercharge their growth.The Chinese economy is strugglingHong Kong's Hang Seng Index recently slipped into a bear market.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Most Consumed Fish in the US.The Global Fish MarketAccording to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global fish market is expected to grow from $1.04 trillion in 2023 to $1.19 trillion by 2028, at a compound annual growth rate of 2.60% over the forecast period. In 2022, FAO reported that the aquatic food production in the world will increase by 15% by 2030.The rapidly growing fish consumption around the world can be attributed to several factors. People nowadays tend to consume protein diets which are rich in vitamins and fish is a prime example of such a diet. Other than the health benefits, the distribution systems have improved so much that imports and exports of fish can be noticed all around the world. Governments have also been offering support in terms of exports. Fish has also entered into a luxury food category where restaurants serve it as an exotic offering and hence people worldwide dine in restaurants to have prawns, tuna sandwiches, and sushi.AquaBounty Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:AQB), Pingtan Marine Enterprise (NASDAQ:PME) Ltd., and Marine Harvest ASA (NYSE:MHG) are among the renowned players in the global fish market. AquaBounty Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:AQB) farms shellfish, fish, and crustaceans. It is also known for producing genetically modified fish such as hybrid salmon, trout, and tilapia. Pingtan Marine Enterprise (NASDAQ:PME) Ltd. does fishing through its self-owned vessels in the Arafura Sea of Indonesia and the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone. It is one of the largest US-listed marine companies. Marine Harvest ASA (NYSE:MHG) is a Dallas-based fish company that owns patented proprietary technology to produce shrimps without any chemicals or preservatives. Hence, it contributes to eco-friendly and sustainable fishing practices.Story continuesThe US Fish IndustryAccording to a report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there were 8.6 billion pounds of commercial fish caught by fisheries in the United States in 2021.The regional insights for the fish market in the United States reflect interesting trends. The main states where fisheries catch fish are Alaska, the Gulf, New England, Hawaii, the South Atlantic, the Pacific Coast, and the Middle Atlantic. Out of these, the three areas dominating the fish market are Alaska, the Gulf, and the Pacific Coast. Alaska contributes to 61.5% of the total fish volume in the country. The gulf comes second, bearing 13.3% of the fish caught. Moreover, 11.23% of the fish volume comes from the Pacific Coast.The fish caught in the country is used for several purposes. 78% of this fish which is more than half of the total volume is consumed as fresh or frozen. A smaller 15% is converted into oils. The remaining minor portion is used either for preparing canned human food or animal food.Recent Trends and ChallengesRecreational fishing has been on the rise in the United States. Opposite to commercial fishing which is done for profit, this kind of fishing activity is more of a hobby or a pastime for leisure. The most common form of recreational fishing is angling where the fish is caught through a hook and line. This trend has increased since the pandemic hit the world. On August 23, 2021, the United States Geological Survey reported that fishers regarded angling as something that relieved stress for them during the pandemic at a low cost. Although this low cost comprises many small expenditures like buying fishing essentials or traveling to a place to fish, the fishing activities boomed during the pandemic which is also evident from the increase in the fishing license issues during that period.There has been a lot of emphasis on sustainable fishing practices. Hence, there is increasing pressure on fishing firms to produce, process, and distribute seafood in a sustainable manner. The concept of Blue Economy comes into existence here. Blue Economy basically refers to all the activity regarding oceans, seas, and shores. Also inculcated in the Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations under the heading ‘life under water’, this concept of striking a balance between earning profits and caring about concerns such as marine life and climate risks is growing more popular in this industry.In order to pursue sustainability, inter-industry partnerships have been a norm. The Shrimp Conference is one such example. Based in the Netherlands, the Global Shrimp Forum Foundation connects all stakeholders in the shrimp industry including fishers, brands, and retailers to network and discuss their concerns. However, fishers in countries like the Philippines and Ghana operate on a small scale. On this scale, they cannot afford to invest much capital in a responsibility as big as sustainability. They also don’t have the right training and awareness regarding environmental concerns.The US fish market is also subjected to issues in the supply chain. On February 20, the National Provisioner reported that 80 to 85% of the fish demand in the US is from imports. These imports cannot be as efficient in meeting the fluctuating demand due to longer lead times for products being transported across the globe. Furthermore, companies have to pay high holding costs to store seafood at the ports once their warehouses are fully occupied.Fish Imports For the USIn June 2022, the University of Florida published the economic contribution of seafood imports for the US economy. It reported that the US imports large quantities of fish, each of which serves a different purpose and proceeds through its own journey. Among different fish species, shrimp imports topped the numbers. Most of the shrimp are imported in peeled form and some as shell. The processed shrimp imports are comparatively less. Salmon serves to be the second-highest fish import in the country. The majority of salmon is imported in the form of a fillet which could be both fresh or frozen. Following salmon imports are crab and lobsters which are mainly imported in more frozen than canned forms.These imports have a significant implication on the US economy. The sectors of the US economy benefitting most from these fish imports are retail, seafood packaging, and restaurants. These imports generate a revenue of $10 billion for food and beverage stores. Full-service restaurants receive $4.7 billion from the use of this imported fish. Moreover, $3.6 billion is earned by limited-service restaurants. The seafood preparation and packaging industry generates $4 billion from these imports.Major PlayersThe major players in the US fish market include both international and domestic companies that are involved in fish production, processing, packaging, or retail. Some of the most notable names in this market include High Liners Food Inc. (TSE:HLF), Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY), Trident Seafood Corporation, Admiralty Island Fisheries Inc., and Thai Union Group PCL (BKK:TU). Let’s take a look at each of them.High Liners Food Inc. (TSE:HLF), is a leading North American processor of value-added frozen seafood. It sells its retail branded products in different grocery stores and supermarkets in the United States under four labels namely High Liner, Fisher Boy, Mirabel, Sea Cuisine, and Catch of the Day. With three processing plants located in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia Portsmouth, New Hampshire and Newport News, and Virginia, it supplies frozen fish to restaurants. With the goal of ‘changing the way we see food’, the company strives to supply food that is easy to prepare and unique in taste as well. On July 1, the company reported that it earned $254.3 in revenue in the second quarter of 2023, as compared to last year’s $253.5. The limited growth was attributed to the cost of holding larger inventories to fulfill the shortages that had resulted during the pandemic.Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) sells and distributes food products to different food chains, retailers, restaurants, and educational facilities through 25 production facilities in the US. The company's subsidiaries ‘Trinity Pride’ and ‘Incredible Fish’ help it source fish products to different parts of the world including the United States. On the contrary, Buckhead and Newport are the company’s brands that supply meat. On August 1, Reuters also reported that Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) has been struggling with cost pressures as consumers have begun to spend more on necessary products than on custom-cut seafood. In this regard, the company cannot even raise prices because the customers are price-sensitive and they can’t afford to lose more.Trident Seafoods is a family-owned seafood business that emerged from fishermen in Alaska catching fish to serve the US market. It currently has its facilities in 48 states of the US. Outside America, the company serves China, Germany, and Europe. On August 15, Morningstar reported that Trident Seafoods will be shifting its plant from Dakuten to Unalaska in 2025 rather than in the previously projected 2024 since they see better opportunities in Unalaska and can no longer bear the high cost of operations. Expressing the current vulnerability of Trident Seafoods to rising inflation, regulatory conditions, and low consumer demand, here’s what the CEO, Joe Bundrant, said:""I've been in the industry a long time and I've never seen markets like this. The rate and pace at which markets are collapsing across our key species is staggering. Not only are global inventories and operating costs high, but demand is low, and some are selling at or below cost just to generate cash.""Admiralty Island Fisheries Inc. is one of the top North American frozen seafood brands responsible for the processing and distribution of wild Alaskan seafood in the United States. It has also been certified by the Stewardship Council for engaging in fishing responsibly. Products offered include salmon, halibut, black cod, and crab. Selling under the trademark ‘AquaStar’, the company serves 17 countries.Another player dominating the US market, Thai Union Group PCL (BKK:TU), is a global seller of seafood. It has its facilities in countries such as the US, France, Germany, Ghana, Poland, Portugal, Norway, Scotland, Vietnam, and Thailand. The products offered include tuna, shrimp, sardines, mackerel, salmon, pet food, and prepared foods. Thai Union Group PCL (BKK:TU) has been ranked number 1 on the Dow Jones Indices for Sustainability. It has also been successful in earning the title of awarded ‘Environmental &amp; Social Management (ESRM) Pioneer’ for being responsible in risk management practices.Now that we have reviewed the US fish industry and some global market players, let's look at the 25 most consumed fish in the US.25 Most Consumed Fish in the WorldMethodologyIn order to rank the 25 most consumed fish in the US, we sourced data from the database of The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NAOO) Fisheries, a US government agency that reports on the marine situation in the country. For this purpose, we utilized the ‘Processed Foods’ on NAOO Fisheries which states that Processed Foods refer to “any fishery product or other food product which has been altered or preserved by any recognized commercial process, including, but not limited to, filleting, canning, freezing, dehydrating, drying, the addition of chemical substances, or by fermentation”. As reported by NOAA’s Seafood Inspection Program, it certifies all edible product forms ranging from whole fish to formulated products, as well as fish meal products used for animal foods. This implies that processed fish products are available for consumption. Hence, we have considered the processed weight of Processed Foods as our metric, measured in pounds, as of 2021. Finally, we have ranked the 25 most consumed fish in the US in ascending order of their processed weight as follows:25 Most Consumed Fish in the US25. American LobsterProcessed Weight as of 2021: 11,407,093 PoundsAmerican Lobster is one of the most consumed fish in the US, located on the Atlantic Coast of North America.

If you want to skip our analysis of the latest in the stock market, then take a look at 5 Most Undervalued Large Cap Stocks to Buy. With the second half of 2023 having set in, all eyes on Wall Street were on officials of the Federal Reserve. Fed chairman Jerome Powell and other central bankers were set to meet at Jackson Hole in late August, and given the crucial role that the banks have played in the stock market for more than a year now, investors were naturally tuned in to see if anything had changed.So far, the Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates to multi year high levels, and courtesy of the strong hype surrounding artificial intelligence, markets have reversed the massive losses that they had bled through last year. However, while the first half of 2023 was one of the best time periods on the market in history, the second half is rather muted when it comes to share price gains. In fact, major indexes have pared back some of their gains particularly since August is vacation time in the financial world and because some folks likely took profits and re balanced their portfolios.At Jackson Hall, Chairman Powell's comments made it clear that since inflation is high, any hopes of interest rates coming down any time soon are unwarranted. However, at the same time, it's also clear that 2023 and ahead will be different when it comes to an extremely hawkish Fed. The Fed chair made it clear that the central bank will be more cautious moving forward and will be more cognizant of any risks to economic health from further interest rate hikes. The labor market continues to be one of the Fed's top markers in determining future interest rate hikes, and Mr. Powell is of the view that should wages grow or unemployment drop, then the labor market could provide consumers with higher discretionary income to drive up prices. Naturally, this is unacceptable, since bringing down inflation is one of the primary objectives of the recent interest rate hiking cycle.Story continuesThe key takeaway from Chair Powell's latest remarks is that the central bank is able and willing to further increase interest rates. Yet, markets seemed to have shrugged off this willingness, as during the last trading day of the week, the S&amp;P500 was up 29 points and the NASDAQ Composite gained 126 points. Both of these indexes had initially dropped as Mr. Powell was explaining his latest position, showing the fear that is currently prevalent in the market when it comes to the Federal Reserve. Even though markets might have been relatively calm today, the fact still remains that there is no fixed formula for the Fed chair and his team to decide when interest rates have reached the perfect level to avoid seriously damaging the economy and bringing down inflation at the same time.This hair wrenching problem was part of his closing remarks as Mr. Powell outlined:Two percent is and will remain our inflation target. We are committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to that level over time. It is challenging, of course, to know in real time when such a stance has been achieved. There are some challenges that are common to all tightening cycles. For example, real interest rates are now positive and well above mainstream estimates of the neutral policy rate. We see the current stance of policy as restrictive, putting downward pressure on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. But we cannot identify with certainty the neutral rate of interest, and thus there is always uncertainty about the precise level of monetary policy restraint.That assessment is further complicated by uncertainty about the duration of the lags with which monetary tightening affects economic activity and especially inflation. Since the symposium a year ago, the Committee has raised the policy rate by 300 basis points, including 100 basis points over the past seven months. And we have substantially reduced the size of our securities holdings. The wide range of estimates of these lags suggests that there may be significant further drag in the pipeline.. . . .These uncertainties, both old and new, complicate our task of balancing the risk of tightening monetary policy too much against the risk of tightening too little. Doing too little could allow above-target inflation to become entrenched and ultimately require monetary policy to wring more persistent inflation from the economy at a high cost to employment. Doing too much could also do unnecessary harm to the economy.Today, we'll take a look at some large cap stocks that are undervalued according to Wall Street analysts. Large caps are generally more stable in the time of a stock market downturn when compared to their small cap peers. At the same time, they also provide more liquidity to lock in potential gains, and the nature of the firms and their business models reduces the risks of stock market scams. There are also several ways to determine whether a stock is undervalued. One of these involves taking a look at the price to earnings ratio while another involves calculating the differential between an analyst's projected share price and the market price.Today we'll rely on the latter and the top three picks are First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCNCA), Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), and MercadoLibre, Inc.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Leggett &amp; Platt The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$328.0mUS$325.0mUS$374.0mUS$394.0mUS$409.8mUS$423.9mUS$436.8mUS$449.0mUS$460.7mUS$472.0mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.00%Est @ 3.45%Est @ 3.06%Est @ 2.78%Est @ 2.59%Est @ 2.46% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.6% US$299US$271US$284US$273US$259US$244US$230US$216US$202US$189(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.5bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$472m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (9.6%– 2.2%) = US$6.5bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$6.5b÷ ( 1 + 9.6%)10= US$2.6bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$5.0b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$27.7, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 27% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Leggett &amp; Platt as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.492. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Leggett &amp; PlattStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Yet should they press pause, they will see an option to buy items from the show: the heroine’s gold necklace, her red dress, or the teetering stilettos in which she is improbably running rings around the villains. Only her exploding perfume is not yet for sale.“Citadel”, a thriller on Amazon Prime Video, shows what happens when the world’s biggest online retailer becomes one of its biggest entertainment producers. As well as buying merchandise from the show on Amazon’s e-commerce site, audiences can listen to its soundtrack on Amazon Music, or read about its production on Amazon’s sister site, imdb.com. Its multinational cast and plot, and planned spin-offs in different languages, are chosen to appeal to shoppers around the world.Hollywood old hands are snooty about Amazon’s video efforts, and understandably so. Despite a reported budget of $300m, making it the second-priciest tv series in history (after “The Rings of Power”, another Amazon project), “Citadel” received lukewarm reviews and failed to crack the top ten most-streamed shows in America (Amazon says it has done better internationally). Critics see it as emblematic of the company’s high-spending, low-impact record in video.This year Amazon will blow $12bn on streaming content, second only to Netflix (see chart). It has had some hits, including “Reacher” and “The Boys”. But its 45 streaming nominations at the upcoming Emmy awards—a record for Amazon—is less than half as many as Netflix or Warner-Discovery’s service, Max. “Amazon’s hit rate is not good, nor consistent with its spend,” admits one former executive.Yet despite its creative misfires, Amazon is quietly assembling something that has eluded most of its rivals: a model for how to make streaming pay. Its shows may underwhelm, but it is preparing to pair them with its formidable advertising machine, and is turning its streaming app into a high-margin marketplace for third-party sales, along the lines of its all-conquering e-commerce site. Hollywood might snigger at Amazon’s output. But the Seattle firm may yet have the last laugh.Story continuesAmazon has been in the video business since 2006, when it launched Unbox, an iTunes-like downloading platform. Since then the company has deployed its tech-sized checkbook to become one of the biggest forces in Tinseltown. Its main streaming service, Prime Video ($8.99 a month, or free as part of Amazon’s broader Prime membership), attracts some 156m monthly viewers—about as many as Disney+ and second only to Netflix.Freevee, its free streaming service with ads, has another 40m or so. Fire tv, Amazon’s range of internet-connected tv sets and streaming sticks, outsells every brand bar Samsung, with nearly 100m devices in use worldwide, according to TechInsights, a data firm.The most obvious motive for Amazon’s video experiments is to increase the value of the Prime bundle, which keeps members shopping on the e-commerce site. But video has the potential to become a money spinner in its own right, in two ways.First, advertisingIn little more than a decade Amazon has created a digital-ads business that has disrupted the duopoly of Google and Meta. Its ad revenue this year will be around $45bn, making up about 7.5% of worldwide digital advertising, estimates Insider Intelligence, a research company. It is already more than a third the size of Meta’s ad business.But whereas Google and Meta both have healthy video-ad operations (through YouTube and Reels, respectively), Amazon’s inventory is mainly sponsored search results on its e-commerce site.That seems to be changing. Amazon has kept Prime Video largely ad-free to preserve a “premium” feel, says one senior executive. But the introduction of commercials last year by Netflix and Disney+ has given a green light to others to do the same. Amazon has been experimenting with running ads alongside sports shows on Prime, and has shifted more of its back-catalogue to Freevee, its ad-supported streamer. Analysts expect to see more commercial breaks on Prime soon.Among streamers, Amazon is uniquely well placed in the advertising game. Whereas Netflix acknowledges that it is mainly limited to generic “brand” advertising, Amazon has enough information on its customers, through its e-commerce site and its Fresh grocery stores, to serve highly personalized ads.What’s more, it can measure the effectiveness of those ads, by observing viewers’ subsequent behavior in its shops. It has yet to exploit this ability fully, but viewers will get a taste of it in September when Amazon plans to run targeted, measured ads alongside its “Thursday Night Football“ program. In November it will show a blizzard of ads when it airs the first American football game to coincide with Black Friday, an annual holiday to honour the shopping gods.It makes this a “foundational year” for Amazon’s video-ad business, says Andrew Lipsman of Insider Intelligence. “The future of their advertising strategy on video is going to really take hold.” Morgan Stanley, a bank, forecasts that within two years Amazon’s nascent video-ad business will be worth more than $5bn a year in America alone, and that in the long run its superior intel on its viewers could allow it to charge higher rates for its ads than any other video platform.That ability will become more valuable as viewing shifts to streaming. Ads on internet-connected television make up about a third of tv ad spending in America. As that share rises, a “pot of gold” awaits sellers of digital advertising, says a former Amazon executive.What’s more, points out Mr. Lipsman, “When you introduce data, it transforms markets.” tv ads are reckoned to be among the most effective, but their impact is hard to measure. As advertisers gain the ability to see how customers respond to their commercials, the tv advertising market, currently worth about $90bn a year in America, stands to grow, with the lion’s share going to the companies that offer the best measurement.Streaming’s new landlordAmazon’s second approach to making video pay is to sell viewers not just its own output but other companies’ content, too. Whereas viewers opening Netflix or Disney+ see only shows on those platforms, those opening Prime Video are offered content from a range of other streamers. If a customer subscribes to another service via Prime, or buys or rents a show, Amazon takes a cut, reckoned to be between 20% and 50%. When a viewer watches a free channel via Prime, Amazon takes a slice of the ad revenue or sells its own ads in some of the channel’s slots.Tom Harrington of Enders Analysis, a research firm, likens the approach to Amazon’s strategy in retail. The company began by selling its own products, before opening its marketplace to other traders. These days two-thirds of sales on Amazon.com are made by third parties, with Amazon taking a commission—a much higher-margin business than selling its own wares. Its aim is to be the same kind of “landlord” in video, believes Mr Harrington.This analysis sheds light on the purpose of big-budget shows like “Citadel”. Amazon continues to stock its e-commerce site with first-party products, to maintain price competition and ensure that the marketplace has a broad enough offering to keep customers returning. Prime Video content plays a similar role: high-profile shows and live sports—something not available from most other streamers—get people to open the app, while guaranteeing them a wide range of content to choose from. “The real question isn’t how many people watched ‘Rings of Power’,” says Mr Harrington. “It’s how many people went into Prime because of ‘Rings of Power’...and then [spent] more on other content.”Amazon seems to be succeeding in getting people to spend time on its platform. Although few of its shows break into the top ten individually, Nielsen’s figures show that Prime Video’s share of streaming in America—about 8.9% of hours watched in July—is about 70% greater than that of Disney+, and more than twice that of Max.Becoming a content landlord is not easy. Amazon’s bargaining power over suppliers is weaker in video, where there are a few big studios with their own direct-to-consumer offerings, than in e-commerce, where millions of tiny sellers use its marketplace. Amazon’s hold over consumers is weaker, too: whereas the company accounts for nearly 40% of e-commerce sales in America, its Fire tv platform handles only about 15% of streaming traffic there.Still, the company is carving out ways of making money in an industry drowning in losses. Amazon may not dominate the Emmys, or Nielsen’s top ten. But, says a former executive, its chief aims in video are for people to watch tv through its hardware, to buy content through its store, and to watch commercials served by Amazon advertising. Even if “Citadel” remains a critical flop, it may have done its job.© 2023 The Economist Newspaper Limited. All rights reserved.From The Economist, published under licence.

To see the top 5 stocks in this list click Ken Fisher's Top 5 Growth Stock Picks.Markets struggled to find a direction on August 25 following mixed comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. While Powell acknowledged that inflation came down from its peak levels, he’s still concerned about high consumer spending and believes further signs of strong activity and economic growth could force the central bank to increase interest rates. Despite this clear stance, some analysts and investors still believe stocks will ultimately come out of the woods and the US will not face a full-fledge recession.Billionaire Ken Fisher is one of the strongest voices of optimism in the current scenario. He’s consistently said that markets are overeacting to inflation and rate hikes and stocks will rebound and now is the time to pile into equities. He isn’t alone in this optimism. Gabriela Santos, JPMorgan Asset Management global market strategist, recently said while talking to CNBC that the markets are back to the “normal” period of volatility in equity markets. The analyst said that profit taking, CPI, seasonal effects and other factors could affect stock prices but ultimately she has a constructive view on the stock market.Top Growth Stock Picks of Ken FisherMethodologyFor this article we scanned Ken Fisher’s second quarter of 2023 portfolio and picked top 15 growth stocks the billionaire had stakes in. We gave preference to technology stocks with high PE ratios which also have strong growth catalysts.15. Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER)Ken Fisher's Stake: $400,000,000According to Yahoo Finance, Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER)’s forward PE ratio stands at 81 as of August 25. The ride-hailing company’s revenue in the second quarter jumped 14% on a YoY basis.Ken Fisher’s hedge fund owns a $400 million stake in the company.Story continuesUber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER)’s CEO said the following about the company’s delivery business in Uber’s Q2 earnings call:“…When we look at the Delivery business, we’re actually quite pleased with the trends there. Last quarter, we grew at about 12% constant currency, that accelerated to 14% constant currency. This quarter, certainly New Verticals was a help. But we continue to drive higher frequency as a higher percentage of our bookings come from our members, as we improve the service, as we improve the average delivery times to our consumer as well, and generally basket sizes are positive there. So again, you break down the growth in terms of audience, frequency and price, and all of those are positive factors in terms of our Delivery business. And going forward, we expect growth consistent with what we saw this quarter or accelerating even from this quarter as well, depending on the marketplace, the competitive position and how things shake out.But generally, we’re quite confident of Delivery top-line growth going forward. And we think the penetration in these markets is very low. So, in many of our developed markets there, significant markets there, we’ve wired up anywhere from 20% of restaurants to, call it, 40% of restaurants in a particular market. So, if you think about just all of the inventory out there, these restaurants are in the marketplace. They’ve got loyal clients. They’re servicing their local communities. And we think as we wire them up, then naturally more people want delivery, because it’s another way of staying connected, it’s another way of getting great food whenever you want on a on-demand basis. So, we think that with the very early penetration into the total restaurant in our major markets being, call it, a range of 20% to 40%, we’ve got a long, long runway ahead of us.”14. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Ken Fisher's Stake: $770,458,000Digital workflows and enterprise operations management software company ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) ranks 14th in our list of the top growth stock picks of Ken Fisher. As of the end of the second quarter, Fisher’s hedge fund owns a $770 million stake in the company. Stifel recently downgraded Datadog and said it prefers companies like ServiceNow (NOW), MongoDB (MDB), Snowflake (SNOW) and Dynatrace (DT) in the infrastructure space.During a latest earnings call, ServiceNow’s management talked generative AI and its collaboration with Nvidia.“Our good friend, NVIDIA Co-Founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, joined us at Knowledge ‘23 earlier this year. And Jensen stated the expanded NVIDIA-ServiceNow partnership is really important. Their partnership of choice for enterprise IT. He thinks it’s an exciting growth opportunity for both companies. We agree. We’re in the midst of a dramatic expansion of the software economy. In 2023 alone, IDC says Platform-as-a-Service spending will grow 30%, and Software-as-a-Service applications will grow 17%. When you correlate that to ServiceNow’s platform and our workflow leadership, it’s clear we live in a great neighborhood on a super nice street, and maybe we’re in the best house.With regard to artificial intelligence, especially large language models, ServiceNow strategy has been laser-focused for years. We accelerated that focus with our Element AI acquisition in 2020. Today, by some estimates, Generative AI could boost global GDP by almost $7 trillion. We see unprecedented parallel adoption across consumer and the enterprise. Our platform experts, who have worked for the greatest brands and technology believe this moment is as transformative, if not even more so than the Internet or even the iPhone. But they’re careful to remind me, it’s all about delivering enterprise-grade, domain-specific large language models, which is the core of ServiceNow’s AI strategy. These models will improve the accuracy results, leveraging a customer’s enterprise data in alignment with their business rules, while maintaining the highest ethical standards for data privacy.”13.

The projected August result would be up 18% year over year, however compared to the month-prior result, growth would be a milder 3% even with two more selling days. This translates to a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 15.2 million units, down from a July 2023 reading of 15.7 million units.S&amp;P Global Mobility: August US auto sales trends remain familiarWhile the year-over-year growth in the market will be sustained in August, there are some faint indicators of market softening. The daily selling rate metric, since peaking at 54,500 sales per day in April, has realized a mild downward trend since. With 27 selling days in August, and an estimated volume of 1.34 million units, the daily selling rate metric would fall below 50,000 units for the first time since February 2023. S&amp;P Global Mobility analysts project calendar year 2023 total light vehicle sales of 15.4 million units. Although the daily selling rate has diminished over the past three months, we do not expect this metric to further decline over the remainder of the year.""New vehicle affordability concerns will not be quick to rectify,"" reports Chris Hopson, principal analyst at S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""Rising interest rates, credit tightening and new vehicle pricing levels slowly decelerating remain pressure points for consumers.""In terms of total dealer-advertised inventories, volumes have stayed relatively static since the beginning of July – at around 2.3 million units, with upward and downward variations of ~100,000 units over the course of a sales month, according to Matt Trommer, associate director of Market Reporting at S&amp;P Global Mobility.On a year-over-year basis, compared to mid-August 2022, inventories have risen by 57% from just shy of 1.5 million vehicles, Trommer said. (Note that total advertised inventory figures include a fractional percentage of vehicles that dealers may have sold but are still advertising, as well as vehicles allocated to dealers but are still in transit.)Story continuesVarious risk factors beyond the US consumer also remain prevalent in the outlook for the remainder of 2023, including the potential for North American vehicle supply disruptions as union negotiations emerge.""The greatest threat to the forecast in the near-term surrounds the union negotiations between the United Auto Workers (UAW) in the US and Unifor in Canada with their respective contracts set to expire in mid-September 2023,"" said Joe Langley, associate director at S&amp;P Global Mobility.

44,3f4f1607-d749-3a52-94f7-27543c7fb12a,SPGI,2023-08-28,13 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-best-defensive-stocks-buy-134744760.html,1693144064,STORY,"['MRK', 'SPGI', 'CVS', 'ABBV', 'AXP', 'UNP', 'JNJ', 'ELV']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 13 best defensive stocks to buy now. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Now.The US stock markets are jumpy amid analyst firms downgrading banks and some analysts suggesting the economy is still not out the recession danger. Fitch recently warned that there’s a chance it might have to downgrade several US banks, including market leader JPMorgan. The news comes after Moody’s downgraded several banks. The industry has already seen the collapse of several regional banks earlier this year.While the US stock market rebounded earlier this year and latest inflation data pointed to cooling pricing pressures, some circles are seeing market optimism with skepticism. A Bloomberg report recently quoted Jonathan Millar, a senior economist at Barclays Capital Inc., who thinks that the picture will only be clear after at least two quarters. The analyst said that while inflation has come down, the Federal Reserve acknowledges the fact that the possibility of a soft landing “is far from assured.”Some analysts also believe that the real effects of the Federal Reserve’s incessant rate hikes are yet to be seen. A report or two showing signs of a slight decline in inflation would not be enough to label Fed’s action successful. In the past, whenever the Fed has slapped the economy with consistent rate hikes, the results were tough. A Bloomberg report quoted a study former Fed Vice Chair Alan Blinder, which studied and analyzed 11 monetary policy tightening from 1965 to 2022. Most of the studied hawkish steps caused “hard landings or a reacceleration in inflation two years later.” That means even if inflation comes down in the short term, there would always be a threat of it coming back. That’s why the Federal Reserve has been insisting to bring inflation down to 2%, but many analysts believe that target is too ambitious and might not be achieved even with more rate hikes without tipping the economy in recession.Story continuesIn this backdrop, it always makes sense to see which defensive stocks money managers and elite hedge funds are betting on. Defensive stocks are always relevant. They aren’t just for recessions or downturns. Having exposure to defensive plays ensures stable and reliable returns as many defensive companies are mature and market leaders with dividend payments and thriving business models.A 2012 research paper by AQR takes a look at detailed data-based evidence highlighting how low-risk, defensive stocks have outperformed volatile stocks over longer periods of time. The report says:Historically, risky securities have not generated higher risk- adjusted returns than safe securities within the same asset class. In other words, investors holding safe securities have received much higher compensation relative to the risk they bared. While academics initially referred to this effect as the “low-beta anomaly,” the evidence has been extended to include other risk measures beyond just beta: total volatility, idiosyncratic volatility as well as more fundamental measures of risk, generically referred to as “quality.”Best Defensive Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Kaleidico on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we first listed down all holdings of the Invesco Defensive Equity ETF (DEF). We then found the number of hedge fund investors for each of these holdings. We then picked 13 stocks from the resultant dataset with the highest number of hedge fund investors. These stocks, hence, are the best defensive stocks to buy according to hedge funds. We gauged hedge fund sentiment for stocks using Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors. The DEF ETF is based on the Invesco Defensive Equity Index (Index) which gives exposure to stocks that “have superior risk-return profiles during periods of stock market weakness while still offering the potential for gains during periods of market strength.”Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Now13. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75One of the biggest pharmaceutical companies, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a solid defensive play due to its pipeline and dividends. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) shares recently jumped after the company upped its full-year revenue guidance. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)’s Q2 revenue also remained upbeat amid growing sales of its cancer drug Keytruda and HPV vaccine, Gardasil.As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 75 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database were long Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). The biggest stakeholder of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) during this period was Cliff Asness’s AQR Capital Management which owns a $298 million stake in the company.Baron Health Care Fund made the following comment about Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“During the second quarter, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) filed the first lawsuit (followed by the filing of additional lawsuits by other parties) against the federal government challenging the constitutionality of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (the Program) that Congress established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. In Merck’s complaint, Merck argues that the Program violates the Fifth Amendment because it allows the federal government to take Merck’s innovative drugs without providing just compensation for them. In addition, Merck argues the Program violates the First Amendment because it forces them to sign an agreement saying the government mandated prices are fair and the result of a negotiation when in fact, Merck argues, prices are not negotiated or fair. These lawsuits will take time to work their way through the legal process and in the meantime, the Program moves ahead on its scheduled path. The consensus view is that these lawsuits will not be successful, and the Program will remain in place.

However, CVS lost a “star” in its largest Medicare plan in late 2022 and this will adversely impact earnings in 2024.

48,57686e69-0156-35b0-8fef-fa783e5b7e1d,PHM,2023-08-28,6 Reasons It’s Time to Get Bearish on Homebuilder Stocks,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/6-reasons-time-bearish-homebuilder-182001837.html,1692642001,STORY,"['DHI', 'LEN', 'LEN-B', 'PHM']","[While some believe homebuilder stocks still have room to run, I personally see signs of an imminent slowdown and break in momentum. If we look at the SPDR Homebuilders ETF (NYSEARCA:XHB), we can see a nasty drop that could usher in more meaningful declines in the months ahead.A chart showing price action in the homebuilders (XHB) ETF.Source: Charts by TradingViewBefore diving into the bearish argument, it’s crucial to understand the homebuilder sector’s dynamics. Homebuilder stocks like LGI Homes (NASDAQ:LGIH), Lennar (NYSE:LEN), D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI), Pulte Homes (NYSE:PHM), and Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL) have capitalized on a robust housing market bull market post Covid-19. However, with rising interest rates and increasing market volatility, concerns of a new housing bubble are emerging. And to the extent that we may be near a credit event, these stock prices could collapse.Let’s delve into the reasons for adopting a bearish standpoint toward homebuilder stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips1. Rising Interest RatesInterest rates have a direct impact on the housing market. As rates rise, mortgage loans become more expensive, which can deter potential homebuyers. Long-duration Treasuries, as measured by the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT), have gotten destroyed as of late, and mortgage rates will spike further as a result.A chart showing price action in the TLT ETF. Source: Charts by TradingView2. Economic Projections and Their ImplicationsThe Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) provides a glimpse into policymakers’ views on economic conditions. A closer look at the SEP reveals an expected slowdown in GDP growth and an increase in core PCE inflation expectations for the coming years. These factors could lead to a less favorable environment for homebuilders.3. Overreliance on Mortgage Rate BuydownsMortgage rate buydowns have become a popular tool among homebuilders to stimulate sales amidst rising interest rates. However, this strategy may not be sustainable in the long run. Rate buydowns often involve reduced payments in the initial years, which later reset to higher rates. If rates continue to rise, the reset could lead to substantial payment hikes, potentially leading to increased loan defaults and cancellations.Story continues4. Overbuilt Housing MarketHomebuilders have been on a construction spree over the past few years, leading to an overbuilt housing market. Deutsche Bank researchers have argued that the housing market is “under-built,” but this view may be overly optimistic. The influx of new homes could lead to an oversupply, pushing prices down and impacting homebuilders’ profitability.5. High Leverage and Cyclical NatureHomebuilders are typically highly leveraged, meaning they rely heavily on borrowed money to finance their operations. This high debt level can be risky in a rising interest rate environment, as it increases the cost of servicing debt. Moreover, the homebuilding industry is highly cyclical, with periods of rapid expansion often followed by sharp contractions.6. Deteriorating Affordability and DemandWhile home prices have been rising, wage growth has not kept pace, leading to deteriorating housing affordability. This could result in decreased demand for new homes, affecting homebuilder sales and revenues.While homebuilder stocks have enjoyed a strong run this year, several signs point toward potential trouble ahead. Rising interest rates, economic projections, overreliance on mortgage rate buydowns, an overbuilt housing market, high leverage, and deteriorating affordability all contribute to a bearish outlook.If there’s a credit event as I expect, homebuying collapses, alongside homebuilder stocks.On the date of publication, Michael Gayed did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Now.The US stock markets are jumpy amid analyst firms downgrading banks and some analysts suggesting the economy is still not out the recession danger. Fitch recently warned that there’s a chance it might have to downgrade several US banks, including market leader JPMorgan. The news comes after Moody’s downgraded several banks. The industry has already seen the collapse of several regional banks earlier this year.While the US stock market rebounded earlier this year and latest inflation data pointed to cooling pricing pressures, some circles are seeing market optimism with skepticism. A Bloomberg report recently quoted Jonathan Millar, a senior economist at Barclays Capital Inc., who thinks that the picture will only be clear after at least two quarters. The analyst said that while inflation has come down, the Federal Reserve acknowledges the fact that the possibility of a soft landing “is far from assured.”Some analysts also believe that the real effects of the Federal Reserve’s incessant rate hikes are yet to be seen. A report or two showing signs of a slight decline in inflation would not be enough to label Fed’s action successful. In the past, whenever the Fed has slapped the economy with consistent rate hikes, the results were tough. A Bloomberg report quoted a study former Fed Vice Chair Alan Blinder, which studied and analyzed 11 monetary policy tightening from 1965 to 2022. Most of the studied hawkish steps caused “hard landings or a reacceleration in inflation two years later.” That means even if inflation comes down in the short term, there would always be a threat of it coming back. That’s why the Federal Reserve has been insisting to bring inflation down to 2%, but many analysts believe that target is too ambitious and might not be achieved even with more rate hikes without tipping the economy in recession.Story continuesIn this backdrop, it always makes sense to see which defensive stocks money managers and elite hedge funds are betting on. Defensive stocks are always relevant. They aren’t just for recessions or downturns. Having exposure to defensive plays ensures stable and reliable returns as many defensive companies are mature and market leaders with dividend payments and thriving business models.A 2012 research paper by AQR takes a look at detailed data-based evidence highlighting how low-risk, defensive stocks have outperformed volatile stocks over longer periods of time. The report says:Historically, risky securities have not generated higher risk- adjusted returns than safe securities within the same asset class. In other words, investors holding safe securities have received much higher compensation relative to the risk they bared. While academics initially referred to this effect as the “low-beta anomaly,” the evidence has been extended to include other risk measures beyond just beta: total volatility, idiosyncratic volatility as well as more fundamental measures of risk, generically referred to as “quality.”Best Defensive Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Kaleidico on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we first listed down all holdings of the Invesco Defensive Equity ETF (DEF). We then found the number of hedge fund investors for each of these holdings. We then picked 13 stocks from the resultant dataset with the highest number of hedge fund investors. These stocks, hence, are the best defensive stocks to buy according to hedge funds. We gauged hedge fund sentiment for stocks using Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors. The DEF ETF is based on the Invesco Defensive Equity Index (Index) which gives exposure to stocks that “have superior risk-return profiles during periods of stock market weakness while still offering the potential for gains during periods of market strength.”Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Now13. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75One of the biggest pharmaceutical companies, Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

(NYSE:MRK) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“During the second quarter, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) filed the first lawsuit (followed by the filing of additional lawsuits by other parties) against the federal government challenging the constitutionality of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (the Program) that Congress established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. In Merck’s complaint, Merck argues that the Program violates the Fifth Amendment because it allows the federal government to take Merck’s innovative drugs without providing just compensation for them. In addition, Merck argues the Program violates the First Amendment because it forces them to sign an agreement saying the government mandated prices are fair and the result of a negotiation when in fact, Merck argues, prices are not negotiated or fair. These lawsuits will take time to work their way through the legal process and in the meantime, the Program moves ahead on its scheduled path. The consensus view is that these lawsuits will not be successful, and the Program will remain in place. We suspect Merck’s arguments may convince at least a few U.S. Supreme Court Justices when the case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, but the ultimate outcome is impossible to predict. For now, we assume the Program will remain in place and invest with that framework in mind.”12. AbbVie Inc.

CVS has been moving its portfolio to a more value-based outcome model, and Aetna was a major move in that direction. We were willing to accept the leverage that came with the deal because CVS has a very cash generative model, and we anticipated the free cash flow would enable the company to de-lever fairly quickly.By mid-2022, CVS was in a position to use the free cash flow that had been going to debt repayment to do bolt-on deals to further prepare for the value-based outcome model and/or return more cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or share repurchases. However, CVS lost a “star” in its largest Medicare plan in late 2022 and this will adversely impact earnings in 2024. This was a surprise and disappointment to us, but management should be able to regain the “star” in the back half of 2023, which will then give the company a nice tailwind in 2025…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.16bUS$6.08bUS$6.22bUS$7.31bUS$7.54bUS$7.74bUS$7.93bUS$8.12bUS$8.31bUS$8.50bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 2.63%Est @ 2.49%Est @ 2.38%Est @ 2.31%Est @ 2.27% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$5.7kUS$5.2kUS$4.9kUS$5.4kUS$5.1kUS$4.9kUS$4.6kUS$4.4kUS$4.1kUS$3.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$48bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.5b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.2%) = US$147bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$147b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$68bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$116b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$82.2, the company appears about fair value at a 5.7% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Medtronic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.998. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MedtronicStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Medical Equipment market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Talking to Bloomberg, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, had said that the Federal Reserve had “no choice but to keep it up” until they are “convinced” that inflationary pressures are under control. He stressed that “a pause is not a pivot” and it was important for the Fed to make sure that inflation does not come back.“Doing otherwise risks some of the embers reigniting. Even though two governors favored keeping rates steady in July, it is important to keep in mind that a pause is not a pivot,” Sosnick reportedly said.A latest Bloomberg report said that the Chinese government has asked some investment funds to avoid being net sellers of equities. The move reportedly comes as an effort to stop the rout that is crushing Chinese stocks and assets.

(NYSE:CCI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Communications infrastructure REIT Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) is one of the best 52-week low stocks to buy according to hedge funds. As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 43 hedge funds out of the 943 funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported owning stakes in Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI). The most significant stakeholder of Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) was Michael Larson’s Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust which owns a $162 million stake in the company.Here is what Aristotle Value Equity has to say about Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Crown Castle, the largest U.S. provider of shared communications infrastructure—cell towers, small cells and fiber—was the largest detractor from performance. The company reported a decline in fiber revenue and a deceleration in tower sales growth during the quarter after record network spending by wireless carriers in 2022 (related to the ongoing rollout of 5G). We continue to appreciate the benefits of management’s differentiated strategy to remain 100% focused on the U.S. while many competitors have instead sought to expand their tower businessesinternationally. We believe Crown Castle’s approach delivers a compelling value proposition as the company’s customers seek to utilize shared infrastructure while making multi‐ billion‐dollar investments in spectrum assets. Although carriers have generally pulled back from network spending this year, we continue to find the structure of Crown Castle’s tower business attractive. This includes the ability to implement a nearly 3% annual price escalator on tower rental rates, the low capital investment needed to maintain its towers and sticky customers with an over 95% renewal rate over the last 5 years. Looking past the short‐term movements in demand, we believe that, over the long term, the company is well‐poised to gain market share and also improve its profitability as it increases the average number of tenants per tower. In addition, management reiterated it is on pace to deploy 10,000 small cell nodes in 2023 (approximately doubling last year’s results). As such, we view Crown Castle as uniquely positioned to benefit from the shift to 5G networks, since the company’s portfolio skews toward urban areas where densification of populations, infrastructure and networks enhances the value proposition of small cells.”8. Illumina, Inc. (NYSE:ILMN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44In early August Illumina, Inc. (NYSE:ILMN) was trading near its 52-week lows. Illumina, Inc. (NYSE:ILMN) has since recovered. Nonetheless it has lost about 20% in value over the past one year.As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 44 hedge funds out of the 943 funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in Illumina, Inc. (NYSE:ILMN). The most significant stakeholder of Illumina, Inc. (NYSE:ILMN) was Robert Joseph Caruso’s Select Equity Group.Polen Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“The top absolute detractors were Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN), Thermo Fisher Scientific, and PayPal. With respect to detractors, the ongoing headache with Illumina’s acquisition of Grail continues to pressure the company’s share price, in our view. It seems increasingly likely that the company will have to divest the early-stage, cancer-testing company soon, as a divestiture order from the European Commission appears inevitable in the coming months. While we believe regulators far overreach on antitrust concerns, our opinions don’t matter here. We would prefer that Illumina own Grail and better position the company to bring potentially lifesaving cancer screenings to patients across the globe. Our investment thesis is based on Illumina’s competitive position in its core, next-generation genomic sequencing business. We remain sanguine on the company’s ability to compound earnings growth at attractive rates for many years to come, and as such, we find today’s valuation quite attractive. We expect the Grail drama to be in the rearview mirror within the next few quarters.”7. The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44American utility company The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) ranks 7th in our list of the best 52-week low stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

In the case of both equities, we have experienced disappointing 2023 market results, and in the case of AES, it is the long-book’s worst performer YTD, dragging down the overall portfolio by -2.09%. Polaris contributed a positive return of 0.21%. These two positions represent investments in similar assets but very different businesses, which explains much of the divergence in this year’s results.In the case of AES, we have a heavily US-focused utility with significant exposure to regulated and unregulated markets and a significant commitment to building out renewable energy. The firm also has some exposure to electricity markets in South America and exposure to electricity storage markets in the form of its ownership stake in Fluence (FLNC). Despite being one of the larger US utilities, the firm has trailed the sector (as measured by the IXUTR Index) dramatically this year…” (Click here to read the full text)6.

We like that Northrop has a larger presence than its rivals in the most favorable subcategories of the defense industry-namely, nuclear weapons, space systems, and what’s known as C4ISR (which stands for Command, Control, Communications, Computers. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance). C4ISR refers to digital systems that translate data picked up from different sensors-such as an incoming hypersonic missile or advancing troops-into a common format, and then escalate key information to the right people These differentiated technologies are especially relevant in a time of increased geopolitical tensions. Northrop also benefits from large barriers to entry in this stable industry, which should enable continued strong earnings and cash flow.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:Goldman Sachs Dividend Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks15 Smallest Stocks In Warren Buffett’s PortfolioStanley Druckenmiller 13F Portfolio: Top 15 StocksDisclosure: None. 18 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
54,58da2897-d518-3df7-bd8f-5640ffd2f183,MRK,2023-08-28,"Has Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) Stock's Recent Performance Got Anything to Do With Its Financial Health?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-co-inc-nyse-mrk-110044007.html,1693220444,STORY,['MRK'],"[Merck's (NYSE:MRK) stock is up by 3.6% over the past month. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to investigate if the company's decent financials had a hand to play in the recent price move. In this article, we decided to focus on Merck's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Merck How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Merck is:8.1% = US$3.1b ÷ US$39b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.08.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Merck's Earnings Growth And 8.1% ROEAt first glance, Merck's ROE doesn't look very promising. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 17% either. However, the moderate 17% net income growth seen by Merck over the past five years is definitely a positive. So, there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Merck's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 12% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Merck is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Merck Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 64% (or a retention ratio of 36%) for Merck suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Moreover, Merck is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 38% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 36%, over the same period.SummaryIn total, it does look like Merck has some positive aspects to its business. Namely, its high earnings growth. We do however feel that the earnings growth number could have been even higher, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings and paid out less dividends. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Now.The US stock markets are jumpy amid analyst firms downgrading banks and some analysts suggesting the economy is still not out the recession danger. Fitch recently warned that there’s a chance it might have to downgrade several US banks, including market leader JPMorgan. The news comes after Moody’s downgraded several banks. The industry has already seen the collapse of several regional banks earlier this year.While the US stock market rebounded earlier this year and latest inflation data pointed to cooling pricing pressures, some circles are seeing market optimism with skepticism. A Bloomberg report recently quoted Jonathan Millar, a senior economist at Barclays Capital Inc., who thinks that the picture will only be clear after at least two quarters. The analyst said that while inflation has come down, the Federal Reserve acknowledges the fact that the possibility of a soft landing “is far from assured.”Some analysts also believe that the real effects of the Federal Reserve’s incessant rate hikes are yet to be seen. A report or two showing signs of a slight decline in inflation would not be enough to label Fed’s action successful. In the past, whenever the Fed has slapped the economy with consistent rate hikes, the results were tough. A Bloomberg report quoted a study former Fed Vice Chair Alan Blinder, which studied and analyzed 11 monetary policy tightening from 1965 to 2022. Most of the studied hawkish steps caused “hard landings or a reacceleration in inflation two years later.” That means even if inflation comes down in the short term, there would always be a threat of it coming back. That’s why the Federal Reserve has been insisting to bring inflation down to 2%, but many analysts believe that target is too ambitious and might not be achieved even with more rate hikes without tipping the economy in recession.Story continuesIn this backdrop, it always makes sense to see which defensive stocks money managers and elite hedge funds are betting on. Defensive stocks are always relevant. They aren’t just for recessions or downturns. Having exposure to defensive plays ensures stable and reliable returns as many defensive companies are mature and market leaders with dividend payments and thriving business models.A 2012 research paper by AQR takes a look at detailed data-based evidence highlighting how low-risk, defensive stocks have outperformed volatile stocks over longer periods of time. The report says:Historically, risky securities have not generated higher risk- adjusted returns than safe securities within the same asset class. In other words, investors holding safe securities have received much higher compensation relative to the risk they bared. While academics initially referred to this effect as the “low-beta anomaly,” the evidence has been extended to include other risk measures beyond just beta: total volatility, idiosyncratic volatility as well as more fundamental measures of risk, generically referred to as “quality.”Best Defensive Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Kaleidico on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we first listed down all holdings of the Invesco Defensive Equity ETF (DEF). We then found the number of hedge fund investors for each of these holdings. We then picked 13 stocks from the resultant dataset with the highest number of hedge fund investors. These stocks, hence, are the best defensive stocks to buy according to hedge funds. We gauged hedge fund sentiment for stocks using Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors. The DEF ETF is based on the Invesco Defensive Equity Index (Index) which gives exposure to stocks that “have superior risk-return profiles during periods of stock market weakness while still offering the potential for gains during periods of market strength.”Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Now13. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75One of the biggest pharmaceutical companies, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a solid defensive play due to its pipeline and dividends. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) shares recently jumped after the company upped its full-year revenue guidance. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)’s Q2 revenue also remained upbeat amid growing sales of its cancer drug Keytruda and HPV vaccine, Gardasil.As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 75 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database were long Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). The biggest stakeholder of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) during this period was Cliff Asness’s AQR Capital Management which owns a $298 million stake in the company.Baron Health Care Fund made the following comment about Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“During the second quarter, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) filed the first lawsuit (followed by the filing of additional lawsuits by other parties) against the federal government challenging the constitutionality of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (the Program) that Congress established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. In Merck’s complaint, Merck argues that the Program violates the Fifth Amendment because it allows the federal government to take Merck’s innovative drugs without providing just compensation for them. In addition, Merck argues the Program violates the First Amendment because it forces them to sign an agreement saying the government mandated prices are fair and the result of a negotiation when in fact, Merck argues, prices are not negotiated or fair. These lawsuits will take time to work their way through the legal process and in the meantime, the Program moves ahead on its scheduled path. The consensus view is that these lawsuits will not be successful, and the Program will remain in place. We suspect Merck’s arguments may convince at least a few U.S. Supreme Court Justices when the case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, but the ultimate outcome is impossible to predict. For now, we assume the Program will remain in place and invest with that framework in mind.”12. AbbVie Inc.

(NYSE:ABBV) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Apart from stock selection, the Fund also benefited from its lower exposure to AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), whose shares were down almost 15% in the Benchmark due to concerns about the company’s growth profile after the loss of exclusivity for lead drug Humira. We exited our position during the quarter. We sold AbbVie Inc. due to our less optimistic view of the company’s pipeline and long-term growth profile.”11.

CVS has been moving its portfolio to a more value-based outcome model, and Aetna was a major move in that direction. We were willing to accept the leverage that came with the deal because CVS has a very cash generative model, and we anticipated the free cash flow would enable the company to de-lever fairly quickly.By mid-2022, CVS was in a position to use the free cash flow that had been going to debt repayment to do bolt-on deals to further prepare for the value-based outcome model and/or return more cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or share repurchases. However, CVS lost a “star” in its largest Medicare plan in late 2022 and this will adversely impact earnings in 2024. This was a surprise and disappointment to us, but management should be able to regain the “star” in the back half of 2023, which will then give the company a nice tailwind in 2025…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

Originally McGraw-Hill Financial, the company changed its name in 2016. The company’s operations consist of five segments: ratings, commodity insights, indices, market intelligence and mobility.We see S&amp;P Global’s diversified business model as primarily subscription-based, which generates a sizeable recurring revenue stream and helps it navigate various market or macroeconomic environments. The company has a significant competitive advantage that provides substantial barriers to entry and sustainable competitive supremacy. We believe that technologyfocused strategic investments made over the past few years should help accelerate organic growth over the next few years, as the company continuously seeks to improve its existing offerings while striving to meet ever-evolving client needs.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:Goldman Sachs Dividend Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks15 Smallest Stocks In Warren Buffett’s PortfolioStanley Druckenmiller 13F Portfolio: Top 15 StocksDisclosure: None. 13 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
56,520de5bd-1dcd-314e-a57a-1613cb932a08,MOS,2023-08-28,Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) Is Increasing Its Dividend To $0.20,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mosaic-nyse-mos-increasing-dividend-101658893.html,1693217818,STORY,['MOS'],"[The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 21st of September to $0.20. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 2.1%. View our latest analysis for Mosaic Mosaic's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. However, Mosaic's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 43.4%. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 24%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.00 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.80. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 2.2% per year. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. It's encouraging to see that Mosaic has been growing its earnings per share at 56% a year over the past five years. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.Mosaic Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've identified 3 warning signs for Mosaic (1 is significant!) that you should be aware of before investing. If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our curated list of high yield dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now.US stock markets are jittery after Fed Chair Jerome Powell made it clear that inflation is still high and needs further taming. Markets also also wavering amid bad news coming from China and some warnings from notable analysts that the economy is still not out of the woods. Talking to Bloomberg, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, had said that the Federal Reserve had “no choice but to keep it up” until they are “convinced” that inflationary pressures are under control. He stressed that “a pause is not a pivot” and it was important for the Fed to make sure that inflation does not come back.“Doing otherwise risks some of the embers reigniting. Even though two governors favored keeping rates steady in July, it is important to keep in mind that a pause is not a pivot,” Sosnick reportedly said.A latest Bloomberg report said that the Chinese government has asked some investment funds to avoid being net sellers of equities. The move reportedly comes as an effort to stop the rout that is crushing Chinese stocks and assets. Chinese real estate companies are again on investors’ radar amid Country Garden, one of China’s top property developers, showing signs of extreme trouble. The company recently suspended trading in 11 of its onshore bonds and analysts believe the company might be restructuring amid problems to raise enough cash to avoid a default.Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash Our MethodologyFor this article, we first used stock screener to identify stocks that recently hit 52-week lows or are trading near their 52-week lows.

The current price of aluminum is unsustainably low, below its cost of production, despite inventories being at historic lows. We believe these depressed prices are due to the evaporation of Chinese demand resulting from its zero COVID-19 policy, but that it will likely recover over the next few quarters.Additionally, Alcoa is leading the industry in reducing carbon emissions from its smelting process which is helping to improve its cost position relative to global competitors. Given its compelling valuation and strong free cash flow yield, we are confident in the company as it is increasingly relied upon to meet the growing structural demand from electrification and the global energy transition.”14.

As more drugs are launched and pipeline investments are more focused under new leadership, we believe the company will be an increasingly attractive asset.”13. Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Israel-based Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM) ranks 13th in our list of the best 52-week low stocks to buy now. Intel and Tower recently said they have agreed to terminate their $5.4 billion deal according to which Intel was supposed to acquire Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM).

This modest increase made it one of our best performers during a difficult quarter. Absent significant news, the business continues to benefit from a hard insurance market. Results are still lagging peers, but the management team seems to be making progress in closing the gap. In the meantime, the company is returning significant amounts of capital to shareholders. Over the past eight months, it has repurchased $4 billion in stock and reduced the share count by 15%. And there is more on the way. This is a good business in a fantastic industry trading at 12X normalized earnings . We believe it is worth much more.”10. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) is down about 42% over the past one year. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc.

(NYSE:CCI) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Crown Castle, the largest U.S. provider of shared communications infrastructure—cell towers, small cells and fiber—was the largest detractor from performance. The company reported a decline in fiber revenue and a deceleration in tower sales growth during the quarter after record network spending by wireless carriers in 2022 (related to the ongoing rollout of 5G). We continue to appreciate the benefits of management’s differentiated strategy to remain 100% focused on the U.S. while many competitors have instead sought to expand their tower businessesinternationally. We believe Crown Castle’s approach delivers a compelling value proposition as the company’s customers seek to utilize shared infrastructure while making multi‐ billion‐dollar investments in spectrum assets. Although carriers have generally pulled back from network spending this year, we continue to find the structure of Crown Castle’s tower business attractive. This includes the ability to implement a nearly 3% annual price escalator on tower rental rates, the low capital investment needed to maintain its towers and sticky customers with an over 95% renewal rate over the last 5 years. Looking past the short‐term movements in demand, we believe that, over the long term, the company is well‐poised to gain market share and also improve its profitability as it increases the average number of tenants per tower. In addition, management reiterated it is on pace to deploy 10,000 small cell nodes in 2023 (approximately doubling last year’s results). As such, we view Crown Castle as uniquely positioned to benefit from the shift to 5G networks, since the company’s portfolio skews toward urban areas where densification of populations, infrastructure and networks enhances the value proposition of small cells.”8. Illumina, Inc. (NYSE:ILMN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44In early August Illumina, Inc. (NYSE:ILMN) was trading near its 52-week lows. Illumina, Inc. (NYSE:ILMN) has since recovered. Nonetheless it has lost about 20% in value over the past one year.As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 44 hedge funds out of the 943 funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in Illumina, Inc. (NYSE:ILMN). The most significant stakeholder of Illumina, Inc. (NYSE:ILMN) was Robert Joseph Caruso’s Select Equity Group.Polen Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“The top absolute detractors were Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN), Thermo Fisher Scientific, and PayPal. With respect to detractors, the ongoing headache with Illumina’s acquisition of Grail continues to pressure the company’s share price, in our view. It seems increasingly likely that the company will have to divest the early-stage, cancer-testing company soon, as a divestiture order from the European Commission appears inevitable in the coming months. While we believe regulators far overreach on antitrust concerns, our opinions don’t matter here. We would prefer that Illumina own Grail and better position the company to bring potentially lifesaving cancer screenings to patients across the globe. Our investment thesis is based on Illumina’s competitive position in its core, next-generation genomic sequencing business. We remain sanguine on the company’s ability to compound earnings growth at attractive rates for many years to come, and as such, we find today’s valuation quite attractive. We expect the Grail drama to be in the rearview mirror within the next few quarters.”7. The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44American utility company The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) ranks 7th in our list of the best 52-week low stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES)’s decline in August was part of the broader utility sector’s decline amid US Treasury yields surging to their new lows.A total of 44 hedge funds out of the 943 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES).Massif Capital made the following comment about The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Currently, the portfolio has roughly 11% allocated across two utilities, The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) and Polaris Renewable Energy. In the case of both equities, we have experienced disappointing 2023 market results, and in the case of AES, it is the long-book’s worst performer YTD, dragging down the overall portfolio by -2.09%. Polaris contributed a positive return of 0.21%. These two positions represent investments in similar assets but very different businesses, which explains much of the divergence in this year’s results.In the case of AES, we have a heavily US-focused utility with significant exposure to regulated and unregulated markets and a significant commitment to building out renewable energy. The firm also has some exposure to electricity markets in South America and exposure to electricity storage markets in the form of its ownership stake in Fluence (FLNC). Despite being one of the larger US utilities, the firm has trailed the sector (as measured by the IXUTR Index) dramatically this year…” (Click here to read the full text)6. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Defensive giant Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) was near its 52-week lows earlier this month.

We like that Northrop has a larger presence than its rivals in the most favorable subcategories of the defense industry-namely, nuclear weapons, space systems, and what’s known as C4ISR (which stands for Command, Control, Communications, Computers. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance). C4ISR refers to digital systems that translate data picked up from different sensors-such as an incoming hypersonic missile or advancing troops-into a common format, and then escalate key information to the right people These differentiated technologies are especially relevant in a time of increased geopolitical tensions. Northrop also benefits from large barriers to entry in this stable industry, which should enable continued strong earnings and cash flow.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:Goldman Sachs Dividend Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks15 Smallest Stocks In Warren Buffett’s PortfolioStanley Druckenmiller 13F Portfolio: Top 15 StocksDisclosure: None. 18 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
61,d6555d0e-9bd0-3027-8e70-4213aa9127bb,CI,2023-08-28,The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 89% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-group-nyse-ci-favoured-110039428.html,1693220439,STORY,['CI'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Cigna Group's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions51% of the business is held by the top 16 shareholders Insiders have been selling lately Every investor in The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 89% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Cigna Group. Check out our latest analysis for Cigna Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cigna Group?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Cigna Group. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Cigna Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Cigna Group. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.5% of shares outstanding. With 8.4% and 4.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 16 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Cigna GroupThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that The Cigna Group insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$324m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 11% stake in Cigna Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Cigna Group .If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now.US stock markets are jittery after Fed Chair Jerome Powell made it clear that inflation is still high and needs further taming. Markets also also wavering amid bad news coming from China and some warnings from notable analysts that the economy is still not out of the woods. Talking to Bloomberg, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, had said that the Federal Reserve had “no choice but to keep it up” until they are “convinced” that inflationary pressures are under control. He stressed that “a pause is not a pivot” and it was important for the Fed to make sure that inflation does not come back.“Doing otherwise risks some of the embers reigniting. Even though two governors favored keeping rates steady in July, it is important to keep in mind that a pause is not a pivot,” Sosnick reportedly said.A latest Bloomberg report said that the Chinese government has asked some investment funds to avoid being net sellers of equities. The move reportedly comes as an effort to stop the rout that is crushing Chinese stocks and assets. Chinese real estate companies are again on investors’ radar amid Country Garden, one of China’s top property developers, showing signs of extreme trouble. The company recently suspended trading in 11 of its onshore bonds and analysts believe the company might be restructuring amid problems to raise enough cash to avoid a default.Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on Unsplash Our MethodologyFor this article, we first used stock screener to identify stocks that recently hit 52-week lows or are trading near their 52-week lows.

The current price of aluminum is unsustainably low, below its cost of production, despite inventories being at historic lows. We believe these depressed prices are due to the evaporation of Chinese demand resulting from its zero COVID-19 policy, but that it will likely recover over the next few quarters.Additionally, Alcoa is leading the industry in reducing carbon emissions from its smelting process which is helping to improve its cost position relative to global competitors. Given its compelling valuation and strong free cash flow yield, we are confident in the company as it is increasingly relied upon to meet the growing structural demand from electrification and the global energy transition.”14. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALNY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALNY) was trading new its 52-week lows earlier this month.

As more drugs are launched and pipeline investments are more focused under new leadership, we believe the company will be an increasingly attractive asset.”13. Tower Semiconductor Ltd.

This modest increase made it one of our best performers during a difficult quarter. Absent significant news, the business continues to benefit from a hard insurance market. Results are still lagging peers, but the management team seems to be making progress in closing the gap. In the meantime, the company is returning significant amounts of capital to shareholders. Over the past eight months, it has repurchased $4 billion in stock and reduced the share count by 15%. And there is more on the way. This is a good business in a fantastic industry trading at 12X normalized earnings . We believe it is worth much more.”10. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) is down about 42% over the past one year. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc.

(NYSE:CCI) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Crown Castle, the largest U.S. provider of shared communications infrastructure—cell towers, small cells and fiber—was the largest detractor from performance. The company reported a decline in fiber revenue and a deceleration in tower sales growth during the quarter after record network spending by wireless carriers in 2022 (related to the ongoing rollout of 5G). We continue to appreciate the benefits of management’s differentiated strategy to remain 100% focused on the U.S. while many competitors have instead sought to expand their tower businessesinternationally. We believe Crown Castle’s approach delivers a compelling value proposition as the company’s customers seek to utilize shared infrastructure while making multi‐ billion‐dollar investments in spectrum assets. Although carriers have generally pulled back from network spending this year, we continue to find the structure of Crown Castle’s tower business attractive. This includes the ability to implement a nearly 3% annual price escalator on tower rental rates, the low capital investment needed to maintain its towers and sticky customers with an over 95% renewal rate over the last 5 years. Looking past the short‐term movements in demand, we believe that, over the long term, the company is well‐poised to gain market share and also improve its profitability as it increases the average number of tenants per tower. In addition, management reiterated it is on pace to deploy 10,000 small cell nodes in 2023 (approximately doubling last year’s results). As such, we view Crown Castle as uniquely positioned to benefit from the shift to 5G networks, since the company’s portfolio skews toward urban areas where densification of populations, infrastructure and networks enhances the value proposition of small cells.”8. Illumina, Inc. (NYSE:ILMN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44In early August Illumina, Inc. (NYSE:ILMN) was trading near its 52-week lows. Illumina, Inc. (NYSE:ILMN) has since recovered. Nonetheless it has lost about 20% in value over the past one year.As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 44 hedge funds out of the 943 funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in Illumina, Inc. (NYSE:ILMN). The most significant stakeholder of Illumina, Inc. (NYSE:ILMN) was Robert Joseph Caruso’s Select Equity Group.Polen Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“The top absolute detractors were Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN), Thermo Fisher Scientific, and PayPal. With respect to detractors, the ongoing headache with Illumina’s acquisition of Grail continues to pressure the company’s share price, in our view. It seems increasingly likely that the company will have to divest the early-stage, cancer-testing company soon, as a divestiture order from the European Commission appears inevitable in the coming months. While we believe regulators far overreach on antitrust concerns, our opinions don’t matter here. We would prefer that Illumina own Grail and better position the company to bring potentially lifesaving cancer screenings to patients across the globe. Our investment thesis is based on Illumina’s competitive position in its core, next-generation genomic sequencing business. We remain sanguine on the company’s ability to compound earnings growth at attractive rates for many years to come, and as such, we find today’s valuation quite attractive. We expect the Grail drama to be in the rearview mirror within the next few quarters.”7. The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44American utility company The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) ranks 7th in our list of the best 52-week low stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES)’s decline in August was part of the broader utility sector’s decline amid US Treasury yields surging to their new lows.A total of 44 hedge funds out of the 943 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES).Massif Capital made the following comment about The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Currently, the portfolio has roughly 11% allocated across two utilities, The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) and Polaris Renewable Energy. In the case of both equities, we have experienced disappointing 2023 market results, and in the case of AES, it is the long-book’s worst performer YTD, dragging down the overall portfolio by -2.09%. Polaris contributed a positive return of 0.21%. These two positions represent investments in similar assets but very different businesses, which explains much of the divergence in this year’s results.In the case of AES, we have a heavily US-focused utility with significant exposure to regulated and unregulated markets and a significant commitment to building out renewable energy. The firm also has some exposure to electricity markets in South America and exposure to electricity storage markets in the form of its ownership stake in Fluence (FLNC). Despite being one of the larger US utilities, the firm has trailed the sector (as measured by the IXUTR Index) dramatically this year…” (Click here to read the full text)6. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Defensive giant Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) was near its 52-week lows earlier this month.

We like that Northrop has a larger presence than its rivals in the most favorable subcategories of the defense industry-namely, nuclear weapons, space systems, and what’s known as C4ISR (which stands for Command, Control, Communications, Computers. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance). C4ISR refers to digital systems that translate data picked up from different sensors-such as an incoming hypersonic missile or advancing troops-into a common format, and then escalate key information to the right people These differentiated technologies are especially relevant in a time of increased geopolitical tensions. Northrop also benefits from large barriers to entry in this stable industry, which should enable continued strong earnings and cash flow.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:Goldman Sachs Dividend Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks15 Smallest Stocks In Warren Buffett’s PortfolioStanley Druckenmiller 13F Portfolio: Top 15 StocksDisclosure: None. 18 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(NYSE:NKE) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sure-check-nike-inc-nyse-100214306.html,1693216934,STORY,['NKE'],"[It looks like NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is about to go ex-dividend in the next three days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Accordingly, NIKE investors that purchase the stock on or after the 1st of September will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of October.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.34 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.36 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, NIKE has a trailing yield of 1.4% on the current stock price of $98.84. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether NIKE's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether NIKE can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. View our latest analysis for NIKE If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see NIKE paying out a modest 41% of its earnings. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Fortunately, it paid out only 41% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see NIKE has grown its earnings rapidly, up 23% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, NIKE has increased its dividend at approximately 12% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.The Bottom LineHas NIKE got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? NIKE has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. There's a lot to like about NIKE, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.Wondering what the future holds for NIKE?

The interview has been edited for length and clarity.Q: How have security issues changed since you’ve been in this role or similar roles? How much more complicated or sophisticated are threats or opportunities to protect customer data?A: One way you you can put it is that the fraud is a pretty big business, it's growing and getting more sophisticated by the day. It used to be that you would get, let’s say, an email sent to you and you’d find something off about it, right? Like there’s a misspelling and you think ""Gosh, I don’t see this person misspelling this common thing"" or the email seems to imply that it doesn't have a deep understanding of who I am. Then it became voices over the phone trying to convince you to do something. Now people can create whole identities using AI.Q: How are you integrating AI into the work you’re doing? Where do you see the most promise for AI in payments?A: We're planning on launching three new products with ties to AI in the next 120 days. For example, we have a checkout feature we are rolling out that uses AI to keep track of all the permutations of your addresses and personal information that you might use, and use AI to predict the right one to use with the right merchant. We currently try to detect unusual patterns — for example, patterns where fraudsters are trying to test your stolen card out to see if it's good or not — and alert you through the PayPal wallet so you can get that card shut down with your bank quickly. But detecting these patterns can get really complicated, and the patterns can change on the fly, so AI we believe will help us anticipate these changes and keep us ahead.Story continuesQ: But on that same point, where do you think AI is being oversold in some ways, or where do you think that the use case in your industry isn’t really there quite yet?A: I think AI has captured a lot of people's imaginations this year. It's made its way to boardrooms, into stores, every product conversation. Some people have been skeptical, and I think some skepticism is healthy. For example, we want to use AI to increase our chatbots' capability to engage with customers, but how much do we invest in such technology — which can be expensive to develop and run — when a customer service agent could do it better? Cost is going to be a massive issue. But in this short timetable since ChatGPT launched in March, I think you can't dismiss any claim you hear about AI at the moment because it's moving so fast.Q: A lot of competition has entered into the payments space in the last several years. Apple Pay. Google Pay. Buy now, pay later. PayPal is the oldest company in the online payments industry. What challenges have there been in trying to differentiate PayPal from the competition?A: PayPal really was a one-of-a-kind company for much of the early part of its life. So back then it was really about just getting scale. You didn’t really have to sell the value proposition. But now we really have to focus on the value proposition. Customers every day choose how they wish to pay for things, so you need to provide value above just being a method to pay, like security and fraud protection, or letting people now they are fully protected while at the same time making us the easiest way to pay.]"

That is, there were more number of shares purchased by insiders than there were sold.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PayPal HoldingsThe President Daniel Schulman made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.0m worth of shares at a price of US$76.17 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$61.19. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels. Daniel Schulman was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider Ownership Of PayPal HoldingsLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. PayPal Holdings insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$101m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At PayPal Holdings Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded PayPal Holdings shares in the last quarter. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. With high insider ownership and encouraging transactions, it seems like PayPal Holdings insiders think the business has merit.

One lesson from past fights is that these cases can create an opening for a new generation of firms to emerge, even if the government isn’t successful.Take Microsoft (MSFT). The Seattle software and cloud computing giant benefited from a 1969 government case against rival IBM (IBM), which the government eventually dropped after 13 years due to what an assistant attorney general called ""flimsy"" evidence. The litigation had alleged IBM illegally monopolized the market for business computers.Later, between 1998 and 2001, Microsoft found itself hobbled by its own extended antitrust battle with the Justice Department, which resulted in a settlement that opened the door to broader competition in the internet browser software market.Microsoft's Bill Gates at a 1998 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee about whether his company was a monopoly that buried the competition. (Harry Hamburg/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images) (New York Daily News Archive via Getty Images)The settlement — which required Microsoft to design its Windows operating system to interoperate with competing browsers, email clients, media players, and instant messaging software — created an opportunity for Google (GOOG, GOOGL), then a startup, to begin its period of meteoric growth in the 2000s.'These things are highly unpredictable'This scenario may be ripe to repeat itself with a new set of federal and state lawsuits that seek to break up Google, Facebook-owning Meta (META), and possibly Amazon (AMZN).The cases create potential for new tech giants to emerge, but no certain path, said former Federal Communications Commission Chief of Staff Blair Levin.""These things are highly unpredictable,"" said Levin, who is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""I'm pretty sure no one would have predicted that the government's antitrust case against IBM would have produced Microsoft, nor ... that the government's Microsoft antitrust case would have produced Google. But they did.""Assistant Attorney General William Baxter announcing at a news conference in 1982 that a 13-year antitrust case against IBM had been dropped, saying that the case was based on 'flimsy' evidence. (Bettmann Archive) (Bettmann via Getty Images)One reason, Levin said, is that back then the emerging technology wasn't obvious. Microsoft didn't directly compete with IBM, and Google wasn't a direct competitor to Microsoft.Story continues""But what is certain,"" he said, citing the story of 5th century Sicilian tyrant Dionysius, ""is that history demonstrates that a Damocles sword over the big companies can have a positive result.""Rutgers University Law School professor Michael Carrier said even if the suits lead to a breakup of the Big Tech firms, emerging companies could remain hard pressed to compete over the short term with the dominant players' established scale.A small toothbrush business, he explains, could benefit if Amazon is forced to stop selling its own competing toothbrush products alongside its third-party sellers.""On the other hand, I don't see a single company that could replace the entire segment of what Amazon does,"" Carrier said about the retail giant's reach across dozens of markets. The same goes for Meta, he said, because emerging businesses cannot quickly replicate its network of users.That scale might already be compounding competition hurdles for one emerging technology, as the cases make their way through the courts. Unlike the IBM and Microsoft antitrust eras of the past, Levin said, today's emerging technology is obvious: artificial intelligence.And Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon are already spending big on AI.""There is an argument that AI will completely transform the way we do advertising in very scary ways,"" Levin said, ""but nonetheless, if we're going after Google's ad-tracking technology, it's not clear to me what AI does to the value of it.""""Is AI creating new moats? Or, is it creating new attacking vectors?"" he said.The new case against Big TechOne agency in Washington is taking on multiple tech giants at once: the Federal Trade Commission.The FTC is trying to force Meta to split apart Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. A federal case filed in December 2020 alleged the social media giant was illegally monopolizing the personal social networking market.Another recent FTC target was Microsoft. It tried to stop the Windows maker from completing its acquisition of ""Call of Duty"" developer Activision Blizzard (ATVI), before backing away from that attempt.""What the FTC is doing relevant to Al, is adopting a merger policy that will tend to discourage investment in startups,"" said former Justice Department Deputy Attorney General Tad Lipsky. The more the government challenges acquisitions of emerging technologies, the more startup funding dies up, he said, and dominant companies will look to develop technologies in house.The FTC is also reportedly preparing a suit against Amazon over concerns the e-commerce giant is unfairly competing with third-party sellers who use its marketplace.California and Washington, D.C., already sued Amazon over those concerns, arguing that the company illegally forced sellers to hike prices outside of the Amazon platform. The case filed by Washington, D.C., was thrown out by a judge last year, and the California case is ongoing.The FTC's campaign is being led by its 34-year-old chair Lina Khan, who has made taking on Big Tech the cornerstone of her tenure. She rose to prominence after publishing a 2017 article in the Yale Law Journal titled ""Amazon's Antitrust Paradox.""The article argued modern antitrust laws weren't equipped to tackle the tech industry's anticompetitive behavior because they were too focused on pricing as a means of determining consumer harms.FTC chair Lina Khan testifying before a House committee in July. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Tom Williams via Getty Images)Those laws, she argued, needed to be rethought to bring Big Tech companies to heel. Now she is attempting to rein in these companies as chair.It's the 1990s all over againBut the case that most closely resembles the government's attempts to rein in Microsoft during the 1990s targets the company that benefited most from Microsoft's quarter-century-old battle: Google.The Department of Justice and a collection of state attorneys general are suing Google in two consolidated cases launched during President Trump’s administration, alleging the company abuses its market power across search and search advertising to squeeze competition.Those cases go to trial beginning Sept. 12 before the US District Court for the District of Columbia, which has dismissed some of the claims.Multiple groups of state attorneys general are also targeting Google's mobile app distribution dominance, as well as its dominance across the markets for selling and brokering online ads.US Attorney General Merrick Garland speaking at the Justice Department earlier this month. (Bonnie Cash/REUTERS) (Bonnie Cash / reuters)In its case against Google, the DOJ alleges the search and advertising giant is violating the Sherman Antitrust Act — the same law, first effective in 1890, that was at the heart of its case against Microsoft.In its complaint, federal prosecutors claim that Google makes software that can't be deleted and is contractually required by default.They made a similar claim against Microsoft in the 1990s. The DOJ and a group of states said the software giant sustained an illegal monopoly for personal computer (PC) operating systems using contracts with PC manufacturers that required them to exclude competing software.The government’s case zeroed in on Microsoft’s proprietary web browser, Internet Explorer (IE), that it developed to compete with the world’s first browser, Netscape.Instead of selling IE as a browser to run on top of multiple operating systems, Microsoft gave away the browser free of charge on Windows-equipped PCs, which then accounted for more than 90% of the market. Microsoft also made it difficult for users to uninstall IE in favor of an alternate browser.But back then, prosecutors ran into a major hurdle that could pose problems for them today: a presumption that lower, even free, prices are a consumer advantage and not necessarily anticompetitive.One possible outcome of this period, said Lipsky, is that this push to rein in big companies could have the opposite impact that regulators are hoping for. It could make the big companies even more dominant.Venture capital funding for startups could dry up because investors fear the companies they support are not going to be able to be acquired by larger players. And if giants can't complete mergers without protracted litigation, they will simply decide to develop more products in house.Microsoft's arc over the last three decades helps prove that point. After its humbling encounter with the Justice Department in the 1990s, it went on to become a major new player in several industries, including cloud computing and gaming.""I think the fact of the matter is, it will tend to favor the large incumbents,"" Lipsky said.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 76% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Molson Coors Beverage. View our latest analysis for Molson Coors Beverage ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Molson Coors Beverage?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Molson Coors Beverage does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Molson Coors Beverage, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Molson Coors Beverage is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.8% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 16 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Molson Coors BeverageThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Molson Coors Beverage Company. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$64m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 19% stake in Molson Coors Beverage. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Private Company OwnershipIt seems that Private Companies own 4.0%, of the Molson Coors Beverage stock. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 4 warning signs  with Molson Coors Beverage , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Talking to Bloomberg, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, had said that the Federal Reserve had “no choice but to keep it up” until they are “convinced” that inflationary pressures are under control. He stressed that “a pause is not a pivot” and it was important for the Fed to make sure that inflation does not come back.“Doing otherwise risks some of the embers reigniting. Even though two governors favored keeping rates steady in July, it is important to keep in mind that a pause is not a pivot,” Sosnick reportedly said.A latest Bloomberg report said that the Chinese government has asked some investment funds to avoid being net sellers of equities. The move reportedly comes as an effort to stop the rout that is crushing Chinese stocks and assets.

The current price of aluminum is unsustainably low, below its cost of production, despite inventories being at historic lows. We believe these depressed prices are due to the evaporation of Chinese demand resulting from its zero COVID-19 policy, but that it will likely recover over the next few quarters.Additionally, Alcoa is leading the industry in reducing carbon emissions from its smelting process which is helping to improve its cost position relative to global competitors.

(NYSE:CCI) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Crown Castle, the largest U.S. provider of shared communications infrastructure—cell towers, small cells and fiber—was the largest detractor from performance. The company reported a decline in fiber revenue and a deceleration in tower sales growth during the quarter after record network spending by wireless carriers in 2022 (related to the ongoing rollout of 5G). We continue to appreciate the benefits of management’s differentiated strategy to remain 100% focused on the U.S. while many competitors have instead sought to expand their tower businessesinternationally. We believe Crown Castle’s approach delivers a compelling value proposition as the company’s customers seek to utilize shared infrastructure while making multi‐ billion‐dollar investments in spectrum assets. Although carriers have generally pulled back from network spending this year, we continue to find the structure of Crown Castle’s tower business attractive. This includes the ability to implement a nearly 3% annual price escalator on tower rental rates, the low capital investment needed to maintain its towers and sticky customers with an over 95% renewal rate over the last 5 years. Looking past the short‐term movements in demand, we believe that, over the long term, the company is well‐poised to gain market share and also improve its profitability as it increases the average number of tenants per tower. In addition, management reiterated it is on pace to deploy 10,000 small cell nodes in 2023 (approximately doubling last year’s results). As such, we view Crown Castle as uniquely positioned to benefit from the shift to 5G networks, since the company’s portfolio skews toward urban areas where densification of populations, infrastructure and networks enhances the value proposition of small cells.”8. Illumina, Inc. (NYSE:ILMN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44In early August Illumina, Inc. (NYSE:ILMN) was trading near its 52-week lows. Illumina, Inc. (NYSE:ILMN) has since recovered.

With respect to detractors, the ongoing headache with Illumina’s acquisition of Grail continues to pressure the company’s share price, in our view. It seems increasingly likely that the company will have to divest the early-stage, cancer-testing company soon, as a divestiture order from the European Commission appears inevitable in the coming months. While we believe regulators far overreach on antitrust concerns, our opinions don’t matter here. We would prefer that Illumina own Grail and better position the company to bring potentially lifesaving cancer screenings to patients across the globe. Our investment thesis is based on Illumina’s competitive position in its core, next-generation genomic sequencing business. We remain sanguine on the company’s ability to compound earnings growth at attractive rates for many years to come, and as such, we find today’s valuation quite attractive. We expect the Grail drama to be in the rearview mirror within the next few quarters.”7. The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44American utility company The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) ranks 7th in our list of the best 52-week low stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES)’s decline in August was part of the broader utility sector’s decline amid US Treasury yields surging to their new lows.A total of 44 hedge funds out of the 943 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES).Massif Capital made the following comment about The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Currently, the portfolio has roughly 11% allocated across two utilities, The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) and Polaris Renewable Energy. In the case of both equities, we have experienced disappointing 2023 market results, and in the case of AES, it is the long-book’s worst performer YTD, dragging down the overall portfolio by -2.09%. Polaris contributed a positive return of 0.21%. These two positions represent investments in similar assets but very different businesses, which explains much of the divergence in this year’s results.In the case of AES, we have a heavily US-focused utility with significant exposure to regulated and unregulated markets and a significant commitment to building out renewable energy. The firm also has some exposure to electricity markets in South America and exposure to electricity storage markets in the form of its ownership stake in Fluence (FLNC). Despite being one of the larger US utilities, the firm has trailed the sector (as measured by the IXUTR Index) dramatically this year…” (Click here to read the full text)6.

We like that Northrop has a larger presence than its rivals in the most favorable subcategories of the defense industry-namely, nuclear weapons, space systems, and what’s known as C4ISR (which stands for Command, Control, Communications, Computers. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance). C4ISR refers to digital systems that translate data picked up from different sensors-such as an incoming hypersonic missile or advancing troops-into a common format, and then escalate key information to the right people These differentiated technologies are especially relevant in a time of increased geopolitical tensions. Northrop also benefits from large barriers to entry in this stable industry, which should enable continued strong earnings and cash flow.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:Goldman Sachs Dividend Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks15 Smallest Stocks In Warren Buffett’s PortfolioStanley Druckenmiller 13F Portfolio: Top 15 StocksDisclosure: None. 18 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase Navient's shares on or after the 31st of August will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 15th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.16 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.64 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Navient has a trailing yield of 3.7% on the current stock price of $17.46. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for Navient Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Navient paid out just 22% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see Navient's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 25% per annum for the past five years.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Navient has increased its dividend at approximately 2.5% a year on average. It's good to see both earnings and the dividend have improved - although the former has been rising much quicker than the latter, possibly due to the company reinvesting more of its profits in growth.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Navient for the upcoming dividend? Typically, companies that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings are keeping the profits for reinvestment in the business. This strategy can add significant value to shareholders over the long term - as long as it's done without issuing too many new shares. Navient ticks a lot of boxes for us from a dividend perspective, and we think these characteristics should mark the company as deserving of further attention.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Navient is facing. To that end, you should learn about the 3 warning signs we've spotted with Navient (including 2 which can't be ignored).If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

74,a18b820c-0b5a-3b13-b9f7-c6e061b415cc,CSX,2023-08-28,CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) Is Paying Out A Dividend Of $0.11,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/csx-nasdaq-csx-paying-dividend-101102539.html,1693217462,STORY,['CSX'],"[CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) will pay a dividend of $0.11 on the 15th of September. This payment means that the dividend yield will be 1.4%, which is around the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for CSX CSX's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Before making this announcement, CSX was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 16.4%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 19%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendCSX Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.187 total annually to $0.44. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 9.0% over that duration. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Over the past five years, it looks as though CSX's EPS has declined at around 2.4% a year. A modest decline in earnings isn't great, and it makes it quite unlikely that the dividend will grow in the future unless that trend can be reversed. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend.In SummaryOverall, a consistent dividend is a good thing, and we think that CSX has the ability to continue this into the future. The earnings coverage is acceptable for now, but with earnings on the decline we would definitely keep an eye on the payout ratio. This looks like it could be a good dividend stock going forward, but we would note that the payout ratio has been at higher levels in the past so it could happen again.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For instance, we've picked out 1 warning sign for CSX that investors should take into consideration.

This makes the dividend yield 5.2%, which is above the industry average. See our latest analysis for Regions Financial Regions Financial's Dividend Forecasted To Be Well Covered By EarningsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained.Regions Financial has a long history of paying out dividends, with its current track record at a minimum of 10 years. Based on Regions Financial's last earnings report, the payout ratio is at a decent 34%, meaning that the company is able to pay out its dividend with a bit of room to spare.Over the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to fall by 1.2%. Despite that, analysts estimate the future payout ratio could be 42% over the same time period, which is in a pretty comfortable range.historic-dividendRegions Financial Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.04 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.96. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 37% a year over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Regions Financial has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 15% per annum. Regions Financial definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.Regions Financial Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Regions Financial that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

To see more such companies, go directly to Ken Fisher's Top 5 Stock Picks.Markets are still in a wait-and-see more as risks of inflationary pressures continue to haunt investors. Many believe the Federal Reserve’s battle against inflation is not over yet and if the central bank caps off its rate-hike spree to soon, chances are that inflation will make a comeback and haunt the economy for years. Amid the stock market rally this year, investors thought the stock market bears were on the retreat as recession warnings were going in the background. But as markets become jittery and pressures in the banking sector and China become visible, bear calls are getting more attention. A Bloomberg report recently cited Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of the Boston-based investment firm Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo, who reiterated his recession warnings. Otterloo said that his earlier recession warning was proven to be wrong because of the AI-led rally. But he believes “it’s perhaps too little too late to save us from a recession.”Many other analysts have been calling the AI-led rally short-lived. They say AI as entered the hype territory and pushed the valuations of tech stocks to dangerously high levels.  There are signs telling that the AI rally is about to end. The same Bloomberg report cited Emmanuel Cau, a strategist at Barclays Plc, who said in a note that the markets are facing a “perfect storm” amid bad news from China, “poor summer liquidity” and rate hikes.What's Behind Ken Fisher's Optimism?Despite the recession warnings, long-term analysts and successful investors like Ken Fisher believe now is the time to take opportunity from market swings. Markets rise and fall and it’s up to investors how they use these swings to their advantage. Billionaire Ken Fisher has been consistently optimistic over the past several months despite rate hikes, inflation, banking crisis and other doom and gloom calls. Other investors like Fisher who like to see their money stay invested in the market and enjoy the compounding effect also have the same stance. But why and how these investors can stay optimistic? A report by Russell Investments takes a look at the importance of “staying invested” in the stock market. The report analyzes stock market data spanning ten years. A hypothetical investment of CAD 100,000 in S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index would surge to $239,816 in ten years assuming that the investor remains invested in all days, including the bad and worst days. On the other hand, if the investor misses on just 10 “best days” the initial investment would surge to $147,184. The report mentions the results of missing other windows of best days, showing how important it is to stay invested in the stock market if ones does not want to miss out on the real gains of market upswings. The report adds:Story continuesStocks have historically outperformed bonds when based on average rolling returns over one, three, five, 10 and 20 years. Just as compelling is the traditional ability of a balanced portfolio to produce positive returns. ... A global balanced portfolio of equities and bonds has not produced a negative return over any five-year rolling period since 1979. The bottom line is that, although there are no guarantees the future will resemble the past, history tends to favour long-term investors.Seen in this perspective, it truly does not matter what happens to the market in the next few weeks. Given that one is invested in the right stocks or ETFs and let the market perform its wonders, short-term volatility should not affect the long-term investment outlook. Let’s see in what stocks billionaire Ken Fisher is invested in in the current environment.Ken Fisher's Top Stock Picks in 2023Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management Our MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Ken Fisher’s second quarter of 2023 portfolio and picked his top 15 holdings. The list is ranked in ascending order of Fisher’s stake value in these companies.Ken Fisher's Top 15 Stock Picks15. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Ken Fisher's Stake: $2 billionVisa Inc. (NYSE:V) ranks 15th in our list of the top 15 stock picks of billionaire Ken Fisher. Fisher’s hedge fund had a stake worth over $2 billion in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 171 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). Visa Inc.

(NYSE:V) is benefitting from summer tourism and a broader recovery in travel.Manole Capital Management made the following comment about Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We like to start out all of our discussions by telling investors who we are. We are FINTECH investors, and we define Fintech as “anything utilizing technology to improve an established process.” We realize that half of Fintech is financial, but we don’t invest in traditional, credit sensitive banks. Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent.We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow. From our perspective, the perfect example of a FINTECH business is the secularly growing payments industry. Names like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) or Mastercard, that generate revenue and profit per swipe or transaction, without the underlying credit sensitivity or risk associated with that underlying line of credit.”14. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Ken Fisher's Stake: $2 billionAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP) ranks 14th in our list of the top stock picks of Ken Fisher in 2023.

(NYSE:FCX).Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Other top contributors during the quarter were copper producer Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) and health care facilities operator HCA Healthcare. With little fundamental news to report, Freeport-McMoRan’s share price advance in Q4 reflected a rebound in copper prices, driven by the recognition that copper inventories are low relative to historical norms. We believe the company continues to have meaningful price and volume leverage in a copper constrained world.”12. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Ken Fisher's Stake: $2.21 billionKen Fisher upped his stake in Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) by 3% in the second quarter, ending the period with a $2.21 billion stake in the company.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 84 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL).

Revenues grew 17% and were primarily driven by Cloud Services (up 29%) with Oracle’s cloud infrastructure (OCI) business growing 89% in the quarter. Oracle has messaged that this business has price-performance advantages as compared to the other infrastructure companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) and appears to be winning business as a result. On the earnings call, management made the case that OCI will play a significant role in the Generative AI workloads which bodes well for continued growth.”11. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Ken Fisher's Stake: $2.4 billionAnother stock that is getting buoyed on the back of the AI boom, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is up about 51% year to date. Ken Fisher has been benefitting from this rally as he has a $2.4 billion stake in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 109 hedge funds out of the 910 tracked by Insider Monkey were long Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 99 funds in the previous quarter.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) is expected to see growth in fiscal 2024.Polen Global Growth Strategy made the following comment about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“While Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s growth has moderated from high teens to low teens during the past couple of years, Adobe continues to deliver solid growth, and management raised its full-year guidance during the most recent quarter. The company also introduced some AI product enhancements, which seem to have helped shift the narrative from “AI is going to be bad for Adobe” to “AI is going to be good.” Finally, the company continues to work towards the Figma acquisition.It’s still uncertain whether antitrust regulators will allow this acquisition to close. That said, the stock seems to have been recovering from the initial reaction that the pricey acquisition indicated something more troubling about Adobe’s growth and competitive position. Solid ongoing fundaments have helped dispel that notion. We think it would be a big positive if the acquisition closes, but we remain confident in Adobe’s business even if it doesn’t.”10. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Ken Fisher's Stake: $2.7 billionKen Fisher’s hedge fund owns about $2.7 billion worth of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) shares as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) recently posted weak Q2 results. Operating income in the period fell 6.6% to $6.59 billion.

For 30 years, Team Depot associates have worked side by side with non-profits around the United States. Focus areas include spending time with the elderly and activities with at risk youth. Team Depot also improves the homes and lives of veterans and helps communities impacted by natural disasters.During the quarter, Home Depot set a goal for battery-powered products to represent over 85% of outdoor lawn equipment sales in the U.S. and Canada by the end of fiscal 2028. Push lawn mowers and handheld leaf blowers and trimmers will run on rechargeable battery technology instead of gas. This will reduce 2 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually.”9.

The company’s software subscription term-license model differs from the traditional perpetual-license software model in two respects: (1) the software is hosted on centralized servers and delivered over the internet, as opposed to traditional enterprise software that is loaded directly onto customers’ hard drives or servers; and (2) the revenue model is subscription-based, typically charging monthly fees per user as opposed to charging one-time licensing fees. The stock’s strong relative performance followed a strong F4Q23 earnings release that easily beat Street expectations on the top- and bottom-lines. In addition to the beat, management announced a number of initiatives that activist investors have been clamoring for, specifically a halt to large M&amp;A transactions and a focus on operating profitability.”8.

This means the annual payment will be 1.0% of the current stock price, which is lower than the industry average. View our latest analysis for Amphenol Amphenol's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. Before making this announcement, Amphenol was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 14.9% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 27% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendAmphenol Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.105, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.84. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 23% over that duration. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Amphenol has impressed us by growing EPS at 22% per year over the past five years. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.Amphenol Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.

For a quick overview of the top 10, read our article 10 Rudest Cities in the World. The issue of residents being rude to tourists is nothing new. Back in 2017, people were asked on an online forum to list down annoying things that foreign travelers often do. Some residents in Italy expressed annoyance at tourists not following rules, such as taking a bath in the Trevi Fountain. Meanwhile, the locals in Denmark did not appreciate that tourists were always getting in their way. The Rising Concerns in Global TourismIn the last couple of years, tourism has been affected by a number of reasons, including inflation, rising costs of travel, and added restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But another factor that has impacted visitation is the rudeness of the locals, which puts off foreigners.For instance, the image of the locals in France being uninviting and rude has led to the birth of a condition, often referred to as Paris Syndrome. It was discussed for the first time in 2004 and published in a French psychiatric journal. The condition is mainly known for being prevalent among Japanese visitors, causing hallucinations, sweating, delusions, feelings of persecution, and dizziness among them. Around 20 Japanese tourists contract this syndrome every year. Paris is not the only city where tourists are treated rudely by the locals. In various locations across the globe, locals have admitted that they do not appreciate the noise, rising rents, and displacement that come with the overcrowding of tourism or overtourism.A survey carried out in Hawaii revealed that half of the responders believe the state wants to benefit tourists at the expense of the locals. In the same survey in Barcelona, residents complained that rowdy tourists and rising rents have made their lives miserable. Locals in Venice also voiced concerns, saying that they have been displaced by foreign visitors. Story continuesA study revealed that because of an influx of a large number of tourists, residents also lose the right to live their lives in peace. Moreover, they feel alienated from their city’s local spaces. Overtourism has also led to various global issues, including global warming and rising car crashes. The large influx of tourists has made some cities dangerous to drive in. Consequently, this leads to greater congestion on roads, and thus, inevitable car crashes. As a result, it stands to reason that locals do not appreciate an influx of tourists and are rude to them, and sometimes, this resentment boils over. For example, in 2016, residents organized protests against cruise companies that were responsible for dwarfing the historic Doge’s Palace. Due to the anger of the locals, various governments and companies have sprung into action to curb over-tourism and improve the behavior of the locals towards visitors. Promoting Sustainable TourismVarious popular locations across the globe, such as Mallorca, Iceland, and Amsterdam, have been experiencing the aftereffects of overtourism, such as deterioration in infrastructure. For instance, Bali – receiving over 6 million foreign travelers every year – is slowly deteriorating. The large influx of tourists is taking a toll on the infrastructure, natural resources, and, most importantly, the people of the island. Therefore, various countries and industry leaders are taking steps to overcome the issues of over-tourism. For example, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) has taken various steps to tackle the issue of overcrowding by tourists.In 2018, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) set up a board to help draft a sustainable long-term vision of the company, which would reduce the role of the company in overtourism. Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) aims to focus efforts on promoting tourism in rural areas, especially since these regions would benefit from tourism spending. The efforts of the company continued in 2022, with it announcing in May that it would be using the platform to house the people displaced from their homes due to inflation. Consequently, it invited its hosts to provide shelter to Ukrainian and Afghan refugees. Shortly after the series of announcements, Airbnb's (NASDAQ:ABNB) market capitalization was at $74 billion. Currently, the share price of the company stands at $128.54. Another company striving to promote sustainable tourism is Marriott International Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), a hospitality service provider. In April 2023, the company reiterated its commitment to helping travelers enjoy their vacations in a sustainable manner. According to Marriott International Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), it will ensure that all of its hotels and properties achieve green building certifications by 2025. Thus, it has started sourcing sustainable cleaning products, bottled water, room amenities, and paper.Soon after the company announced its steps toward becoming more environmentally responsible, Marriott International Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR)'s share price showed an upward trend. It rose from $170.14 in April 2023 to $201.81 at the end of July 2023.Branding to Improve ReputationCities are not new to rebranding activities, especially those with poor public images. For instance, New York City revamped its image in the 1970s, by partnering up with an advertising firm to start the “I Love NY” campaign.Cities tend to use branding opportunities to come up with flagship projects that set them apart from the rest of the world. It is also a helpful way to move in the direction of economic and urban renewal. Some examples of these include the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao. Moreover, such branding activities are an opportunity for cities to change the way foreign travelers view them. For instance, Paris decided to host the 2024 Olympics and Paralympics to create excitement among locals and foreigners alike and promote a more inclusive image of itself. To create a more positive image of the city, the Paris 2024 Olympic Committee has partnered up with some top luxury brands, such as Sephora and LVMH Moët Hennessy (NYSE:LVMUY). LVMH Moët Hennessy (NYSE:LVMUY) has agreed to be a premium partner for the event, with sources revealing that the company spent around $163 million to seal the deal. Only a month after LVMH (NYSE:LVMUY) made this announcement, its stock stood at $858.73, an increase from $694.10 recorded at the start of the year. The dividend yield as of August 23, 2023 was recorded as 1.58%. LVMH (NYSE:LVMUY) is currently valued at $431.12 billion. 30 Rudest Cities in the Worldlittleny/Shutterstock.comMethodologyWe have explained ‘rudest cities in the world’ as ones that are believed to be home to unfriendly locals, who can be unwelcoming and unhelpful to foreign travelers.

""However, over the long term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our Data Center GPUs to China, if implemented, will result in a permanent loss and opportunity for the US industry to compete and lead in one of the world's largest markets.""China represents a significant chunk of Nvidia's data center business: 20% to 25%, depending on the quarter.The Biden administration is reportedly eyeing new curbs on China's ability to access critical technology, and that would likely involve restricting the sale of the high-end chips Nvidia is selling to power new AI platforms.Nvidia stock is not currently priced for the risk of a huge portion of business drying up, trading on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 61. (Check out these other exorbitant metrics on Nvidia.)But maybe there should be more China risk priced into Nvidia's stock.And this also goes for other large US companies that look to China to supercharge their growth.The Chinese economy is strugglingHong Kong's Hang Seng Index recently slipped into a bear market. The Chinese yuan is hovering around 16-year lows. Markets are looking to China policymakers to offer more rate cuts to stem yawning weakness in the commercial property market.Global investment banks are slashing their GDP growth targets on China to sub 5%.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 Biggest Companies in the World by 2023 Revenue.The biggest companies in the world by 2023 revenue operate within a range of different market sectors, including retail, healthcare, technology, and oil and gas. First, let’s take a look at what some of the biggest companies in the world by revenue are up to.Retail Giants Raise the BarThe retail market ranks among the top industries in the world. Retailing involves buying directly from producers or from wholesalers, exhibiting products for sale either in-stores or online, and now it can sometimes also include delivery. According to Research and Markets, the global retail market was valued at around $26.2 trillion in 2022. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.4% during 2023-2027, propelling the market to reach $37.6 trillion by the end of the forecasted period.E-commerce or online retail remains the fastest growing segment in the retail industry. With the growth of mobile devices and internet services, e-commerce has become a major shopping platform around the world. Companies in this space are working to improve customer satisfaction by offering a wide variety of different and customized items as well as quick deliveries. On July 31, Bloomberg reported that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has announced their plans of doubling the number of US same-day delivery facilities in the coming years. Speedy delivery is of vital importance for the online shopping market leader. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also said that it has delivered more than 1.8 billion units to Prime members in the US with same-day or one-day delivery so far this year, up about four times from the same period in 2019. Unlike bigger warehouses that are located near highways on the outskirts of cities, same-day facilities are smaller and closer to major population centers and allow Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to fulfill, sort, and deliver all from one site to accelerate the entire process of delivering customer packages.Story continuesSome of the biggest companies in the retail and e-commerce markets are also increasingly investing in drones to reduce delivery times and boost profitability. On August 24, Bloomberg reported that Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is teaming up with Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Wing unit and planning its longest drone deliveries yet from two Dallas-area stores. According to the report, the Wing drones will be able to drop off household essentials and food items as far as 6 miles from the store and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) expects to be able to offer drone coverage to around 60,000 homes. This partnership marks a significant expansion in drone service and also shows how serious some of the retail giants are about using robotic aircraft to serve their customers.Companies in Technology, Healthcare, and Energy to Reach New HeightsOn July 19, Bloomberg reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is quietly working on AI tools that could challenge OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Bard and others. The company has built its own framework, known as ‘Ajax’, to create large language models, while also testing a chatbot that some engineers call ‘Apple GPT’. Generative AI has the potential to change how people interact with phones, computers and other technology, and Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices could suffer if the big tech giant doesn’t keep up with AI advancements. According to the report, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has yet to devise a clear strategy for releasing the technology to consumers, but the people familiar with the effort believe that the company is aiming to make a significant AI-related announcement next year.The leading companies in the healthcare industry are working to provide a better quality of care as well as patient satisfaction. It is a massive industry, and it continues to grow as the population swells. According to the latest market research reports, future trends in healthcare include adoption of emerging health-focused technology. On August 11, Reuters reported that Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has provisionally cleared UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (NYSE:UNH) $1.58 billion acquisition of the UK healthcare technology firm EMIS Group plc (LON:EMIS) as it found no competition concerns in the deal between specialist health care tech and software companies. UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) is one of the largest healthcare companies in the world, and it operates in the UK as Optum. It supplies software used by general practitioners within the National Health Service (NHS) to prescribe medicines to patients. Acquisition of EMIS Group plc is expected to bring more advanced technology solutions and capabilities to the NHS, and help general practitioners to improve patient care.On June 1, Reuters reported that with the help of new technologies, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is looking to double the amount of oil produced from its shale holdings in the US over a period of five years. In December 2022, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) had set a goal to produce between 900,000 to 1 million barrels of oil per day in the top US shale field, Permian Basin, by 2027, while also announcing plans for a five-year technology development programme. The post mentions that the CEO of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Darren Woods, said that they currently recover about 10% of shale resources from its operations and that a lot of oil is still being left in the ground. Developing new technology will help Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) better identify acquisition targets as well as keep the fracks open better in order to boost oil flow and significantly improve recovery.Now that we've discussed what some of the leading companies in some of the biggest industries are up to, let's take a look at the 30 biggest companies in the world by revenue as of 2023.30 Biggest Companies in the World by 2023 RevenueMethodologyIn this article, we have listed the 30 biggest companies in the world by 2023 revenue.

""However, over the long term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our Data Center GPUs to China, if implemented, will result in a permanent loss and opportunity for the US industry to compete and lead in one of the world's largest markets.""China represents a significant chunk of Nvidia's data center business: 20% to 25%, depending on the quarter.The Biden administration is reportedly eyeing new curbs on China's ability to access critical technology, and that would likely involve restricting the sale of the high-end chips Nvidia is selling to power new AI platforms.Nvidia stock is not currently priced for the risk of a huge portion of business drying up, trading on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 61. (Check out these other exorbitant metrics on Nvidia.)But maybe there should be more China risk priced into Nvidia's stock.And this also goes for other large US companies that look to China to supercharge their growth.The Chinese economy is strugglingHong Kong's Hang Seng Index recently slipped into a bear market.

94,6343e042-4125-35ed-aed0-3e5eaaeefd04,DIS,2023-08-28,Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) May Have Issues Allocating Its Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walt-disney-nyse-dis-may-140013136.html,1693144813,STORY,['DIS'],"[What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. However, after investigating Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Walt Disney:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.044 = US$7.7b ÷ (US$204b - US$28b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).Thus, Walt Disney has an ROCE of 4.4%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Entertainment industry average of 10%. View our latest analysis for Walt Disney roceIn the above chart we have measured Walt Disney's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Walt Disney here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEOn the surface, the trend of ROCE at Walt Disney doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 18% over the last five years. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.What We Can Learn From Walt Disney's ROCEIn summary, Walt Disney is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. And in the last five years, the stock has given away 24% so the market doesn't look too hopeful on these trends strengthening any time soon. In any case, the stock doesn't have these traits of a multi-bagger discussed above, so if that's what you're looking for, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.Story continuesOn a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for Walt Disney  that we think you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

After all, you continue to get paid even if share prices fall. Of course, the higher the yield the greater the risk overall. Many companies that pay above 5% are considered high-yield/high-risk. However, if you simply look for firms that have long histories of paying uninterrupted dividends you’ll be that much safer. High-Yield Dividend Stocks: Altria (MO) packs of cigarettes in convenience store rackSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.comWith a yield of 8.8%, Altria (NYSE:MO) is one of the top high-yield dividend stocks to buy and hold. Like many other tobacco firms, MO is going through a major transition – especially with smoking rates dropping. At Altria, cigarette shipment volumes fell by 8.7% in the second quarter. To deal with the drop-off, Altria is finding ways to replace revenue streams that have suffered as smoking becomes less common. Despite recent negatives for the company, its dividend is still high at 8.8%. Better, that dividend hasn’t been reached since 1970.British American Tobacco (BTI)British American Tobacco logo on a buildingSource: DutchMen / Shutterstock.comMuch like Altria, British American Tobacco’s (NYSE:BTI) dividend yields a similarly high 8.7%. While BTI did reduce its dividend in 2018,  its dividend has a lower payout ratio which is advantageous. In addition, unlike Altria, BTI is not seeing a contraction. Instead, in the first half of the year, the company’s revenues were up 4.4%. In addition, the company is doing well in terms of its transition to new product categories which grew by 26.6% during the period. Non-combustible revenues currently account for 16.6% of the firm-wide revenues. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHigh-Yield Dividend Stocks: Kinder Morgan (KMI) Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAnother one of the top high-yield dividend stocks to consider is Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI), a natural gas and oil pipeline transportation firm. It includes a dividend that hasn’t been reduced since 2016 and currently yields 6.5%. Story continuesSome investors might be leery of investing in pipeline shares for the simple reason that 2022 was a boom year and 2023 has been weaker. I wouldn’t be. For one, that’s just part of the nature of investing in oil companies. Commodities rise and fall and are governed by so many factors that accurately predicting their prices becomes nearly impossible. Two, Kinder Morgan has committed to increasing its dividend by 2% this year in any case.Further, net income remains unchanged through the first half of 2023 even as revenues have fallen significantly. In general, oil companies are focused on rewarding investors through dividend payments as a primary concern. As long as they steadily pay income investors are less concerned with revenue fluctuations that are a natural consequence of the commodity-based business. ONEOK (OKE) Oneok company logo icon on websiteSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.comONEOK (NYSE:OKE) is another one of the top high-yield dividend stocks and a midstream energy producer. At the moment, it yields 5.85% and hasn’t seen a reduction since 1999. Better, company earnings increased by 13% with EBITDA rising by 10%. Basically, natural gas throughout and processing volumes are growing at a healthy clip. Even better, the company just increased guidance following the results. The firm now expects to see $2.49 billion in income in 2023 at the midpoint, up from $2.41 billion. The firm has historically shown that it is capable of creating value on a long-term basis. Its capital returns exceed its capital costs. The company is well-run overall and that should give investors confidence in it as an investment. High-Yield Dividend Stocks: AT&amp;T (T)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockAT&amp;T (NYSE:T) shares have provided an annualized return of 1.76%. $10k invested would have grown to be worth $11,906. That’s attractive to just about no one. However, the dividend changes the calculus entirely. It currently yields 7.9%. Theoretically, an investor could have taken those dividends and purchased more T shares thus entitling themselves to even more dividends. Suffice it to say, returns are much higher than 1.76%. Revenues grew slightly for AT&amp;T in Q2 and cash flows increased substantially. The firm’s shares will continue to benefit from the potential of 5G. That should keep demand stable and if those investments bear significant fruit T shares could actually appreciate. LyondellBasell Industries (LYB)A LyondellBasell production plant in Wesseling, Germany is seen at dusk.Source: Flagmania / Shutterstock.comI like LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB) as a stock investment because it provides relatively high yields but from a relatively low-risk sector. Investors get a respectable income source in a predictable sector. The firm produces plastic resins and chemicals and carries a beta of 1.2. The company looks to have momentum on its side. H1 results showed a contraction in both revenues and income but Q2 saw a rebound as both measures normalized on a year-over-year basis. Investors should anticipate that LYB share prices will remain flat for a while.

(NASDAQ:FFIV), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at F5’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for F5 What's The Opportunity In F5?The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that F5’s ratio of 28.08x is trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 29.39x, which means if you buy F5 today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that F5 should be trading at this level in the long run, then there’s not much of an upside to gain over and above other industry peers. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since F5’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will F5 generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 77% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for F5. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? FFIV’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at FFIV? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on FFIV, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for FFIV, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

Others wagered on macroeconomic uncertainties to halt any sharp rally above $80 a barrel.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude managed to stay above $80 but its gain on the day was modest, at 27 cents, or 0.3%, for the settlement at $80.10.The U.S. crude benchmark finished last week down 1.8%, after shedding 2.3% the week prior. Before that, it rose for seven weeks in a row in a rally that lifted WTI by nearly 20%.London-traded Brent settled down 6 cents, or 0.1%, at $84.42 per barrel. Brent fell 0.4% last week, adding to the previous week’s 2.3% drop. Before that, the global crude benchmark also rose for seven weeks in a row, rising by a total of 18%.Tropical Storm Idalia was, meanwhile, intensifying on its track towards Cuba and was likely to cause a day or two of power outages, IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said in comments carried by Reuters. That ""should see some short-term support for the oil price"", he added.Focus was also on ""China actions to support its economy…and whether Brent can regain momentum on a break above $85"", said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.On the macroeconomic front, investors were looking out for Tuesday’s reading on U.S. consumer confidence, Wednesday’s estimate on second-quarter Gross Domestic Product GDP and Friday’s report on non-farm payrolls — all for the month of August.Of these, the jobs report is most concerning to traders as a stronger-than-expected number would mean stubborn inflation that could prompt the Federal Reserve to keep to its higher-for-longer interest rate regime.July’s addition of 187,000 jobs was the smallest since March 2021.

(NYSE:JNPR) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next two days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Thus, you can purchase Juniper Networks' shares before the 31st of August in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 22nd of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.22 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.88 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Juniper Networks has a trailing yield of approximately 3.1% on its current stock price of $28.08. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Juniper Networks's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for Juniper Networks If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Juniper Networks paid out 67% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 49% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see Juniper Networks earnings per share are up 9.6% per annum over the last five years. While earnings have been growing at a credible rate, the company is paying out a majority of its earnings to shareholders. Therefore it's unlikely that the company will be able to reinvest heavily in its business, which could presage slower growth in the future.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, nine years ago, Juniper Networks has lifted its dividend by approximately 9.2% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayShould investors buy Juniper Networks for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share growth has been modest and Juniper Networks paid out over half of its profits and less than half of its free cash flow, although both payout ratios are within normal limits. Overall, it's hard to get excited about Juniper Networks from a dividend perspective.While it's tempting to invest in Juniper Networks for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. To help with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Juniper Networks that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

(NYSE:PX) will pay a dividend of $0.0325 on the 20th of September. Including this payment, the dividend yield on the stock will be 1.1%, which is a modest boost for shareholders' returns. View our latest analysis for P10 P10's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. Based on the last payment, P10's profits didn't cover the dividend, but the company was generating enough cash instead. Generally, we think cash is more important than accounting measures of profit, so with the cash flows easily covering the dividend, we don't think there is much reason to worry.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 28%, which would make us comfortable with the dividend's sustainability, despite the levels currently being elevated.historic-dividendP10 Is Still Building Its Track RecordIt is tough to make a judgement on how stable a dividend is when the company hasn't been paying one for very long. This doesn't mean that the company can't pay a good dividend, but just that we want to wait until it can prove itself.P10 Might Find It Hard To Grow Its DividendThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that P10 has been growing its earnings per share at 15% a year over the past five years. Although per-share earnings are growing at a credible rate, the massive payout ratio may limit growth in the company's future dividend payments.Our Thoughts On P10's DividendOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The payments haven't been particularly stable and we don't see huge growth potential, but with the dividend well covered by cash flows it could prove to be reliable over the short term. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

By moving to the cloud, RFDS has reduced administrative workloads and lowered its data management costs by approximately 20 percent.One of the largest aeromedical organisations in the world, RFDS provides primary healthcare and 24-hour emergency services to those living in rural and remote Australia. The organisation performs 1,000 patient interactions a day and prior to moving to cloud relied heavily on paper-based processes and disparate, standalone record management solutions. As a result, significant administration efforts, to keep patient records updated, are time consuming to compile, frequently duplicated, and challenging to manage.

Patient and emergency incident data can now be synchronised automatically in the field, back at base, across operation centres, and with other healthcare providers. A national fleet of application programming interfaces (APIs) powered by Oracle Integration Cloud are interconnected with Oracle Autonomous Database, enabling RFDS' branches across the country to transact data securely across state borders and with national entities, such as the Australian Digital Health Agency and hospitals.Additionally, RFDS uses Oracle GoldenGate to create a digital data twin for offline mode that allows live replication of the database. This enables field doctors in the outback of Australia to use a tablet to enter and retrieve the latest patient information without an internet connection. At the same time, RFDS is using Oracle Business Intelligence (BI) to create dashboards for monitoring the efficiency and effectiveness of its assets, as medical staff attend to patient emergencies or transfer care. RFDS' electronic health record system runs on Microsoft Azure while Oracle Integration Cloud automates end-to-end processes and centralises management by enabling an API fleet, microservices, and application integrations.""RFDS provides an incredible service to the Australian Outback and we are honoured to collaborate with them on their innovative and digital health modernisation journey,"" said Stephen Bovis, regional managing director, Australia and New Zealand, Oracle.

To see the top 5 stocks in this list click Ken Fisher's Top 5 Growth Stock Picks.Markets struggled to find a direction on August 25 following mixed comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. While Powell acknowledged that inflation came down from its peak levels, he’s still concerned about high consumer spending and believes further signs of strong activity and economic growth could force the central bank to increase interest rates. Despite this clear stance, some analysts and investors still believe stocks will ultimately come out of the woods and the US will not face a full-fledge recession.Billionaire Ken Fisher is one of the strongest voices of optimism in the current scenario. He’s consistently said that markets are overeacting to inflation and rate hikes and stocks will rebound and now is the time to pile into equities. He isn’t alone in this optimism. Gabriela Santos, JPMorgan Asset Management global market strategist, recently said while talking to CNBC that the markets are back to the “normal” period of volatility in equity markets. The analyst said that profit taking, CPI, seasonal effects and other factors could affect stock prices but ultimately she has a constructive view on the stock market.Top Growth Stock Picks of Ken FisherMethodologyFor this article we scanned Ken Fisher’s second quarter of 2023 portfolio and picked top 15 growth stocks the billionaire had stakes in.

Last quarter, we grew at about 12% constant currency, that accelerated to 14% constant currency. This quarter, certainly New Verticals was a help. But we continue to drive higher frequency as a higher percentage of our bookings come from our members, as we improve the service, as we improve the average delivery times to our consumer as well, and generally basket sizes are positive there. So again, you break down the growth in terms of audience, frequency and price, and all of those are positive factors in terms of our Delivery business. And going forward, we expect growth consistent with what we saw this quarter or accelerating even from this quarter as well, depending on the marketplace, the competitive position and how things shake out.But generally, we’re quite confident of Delivery top-line growth going forward. And we think the penetration in these markets is very low. So, in many of our developed markets there, significant markets there, we’ve wired up anywhere from 20% of restaurants to, call it, 40% of restaurants in a particular market. So, if you think about just all of the inventory out there, these restaurants are in the marketplace. They’ve got loyal clients. They’re servicing their local communities. And we think as we wire them up, then naturally more people want delivery, because it’s another way of staying connected, it’s another way of getting great food whenever you want on a on-demand basis. So, we think that with the very early penetration into the total restaurant in our major markets being, call it, a range of 20% to 40%, we’ve got a long, long runway ahead of us.”14. ServiceNow, Inc.

We agree. We’re in the midst of a dramatic expansion of the software economy. In 2023 alone, IDC says Platform-as-a-Service spending will grow 30%, and Software-as-a-Service applications will grow 17%.

We see unprecedented parallel adoption across consumer and the enterprise. Our platform experts, who have worked for the greatest brands and technology believe this moment is as transformative, if not even more so than the Internet or even the iPhone. But they’re careful to remind me, it’s all about delivering enterprise-grade, domain-specific large language models, which is the core of ServiceNow’s AI strategy. These models will improve the accuracy results, leveraging a customer’s enterprise data in alignment with their business rules, while maintaining the highest ethical standards for data privacy.”13.

To see more such companies, go directly to Ken Fisher's Top 5 Stock Picks.Markets are still in a wait-and-see more as risks of inflationary pressures continue to haunt investors. Many believe the Federal Reserve’s battle against inflation is not over yet and if the central bank caps off its rate-hike spree to soon, chances are that inflation will make a comeback and haunt the economy for years. Amid the stock market rally this year, investors thought the stock market bears were on the retreat as recession warnings were going in the background. But as markets become jittery and pressures in the banking sector and China become visible, bear calls are getting more attention. A Bloomberg report recently cited Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of the Boston-based investment firm Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo, who reiterated his recession warnings. Otterloo said that his earlier recession warning was proven to be wrong because of the AI-led rally. But he believes “it’s perhaps too little too late to save us from a recession.”Many other analysts have been calling the AI-led rally short-lived. They say AI as entered the hype territory and pushed the valuations of tech stocks to dangerously high levels.  There are signs telling that the AI rally is about to end. The same Bloomberg report cited Emmanuel Cau, a strategist at Barclays Plc, who said in a note that the markets are facing a “perfect storm” amid bad news from China, “poor summer liquidity” and rate hikes.What's Behind Ken Fisher's Optimism?Despite the recession warnings, long-term analysts and successful investors like Ken Fisher believe now is the time to take opportunity from market swings. Markets rise and fall and it’s up to investors how they use these swings to their advantage. Billionaire Ken Fisher has been consistently optimistic over the past several months despite rate hikes, inflation, banking crisis and other doom and gloom calls. Other investors like Fisher who like to see their money stay invested in the market and enjoy the compounding effect also have the same stance. But why and how these investors can stay optimistic? A report by Russell Investments takes a look at the importance of “staying invested” in the stock market. The report analyzes stock market data spanning ten years. A hypothetical investment of CAD 100,000 in S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index would surge to $239,816 in ten years assuming that the investor remains invested in all days, including the bad and worst days. On the other hand, if the investor misses on just 10 “best days” the initial investment would surge to $147,184. The report mentions the results of missing other windows of best days, showing how important it is to stay invested in the stock market if ones does not want to miss out on the real gains of market upswings. The report adds:Story continuesStocks have historically outperformed bonds when based on average rolling returns over one, three, five, 10 and 20 years. Just as compelling is the traditional ability of a balanced portfolio to produce positive returns. ... A global balanced portfolio of equities and bonds has not produced a negative return over any five-year rolling period since 1979. The bottom line is that, although there are no guarantees the future will resemble the past, history tends to favour long-term investors.Seen in this perspective, it truly does not matter what happens to the market in the next few weeks. Given that one is invested in the right stocks or ETFs and let the market perform its wonders, short-term volatility should not affect the long-term investment outlook. Let’s see in what stocks billionaire Ken Fisher is invested in in the current environment.Ken Fisher's Top Stock Picks in 2023Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management Our MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Ken Fisher’s second quarter of 2023 portfolio and picked his top 15 holdings.

We are FINTECH investors, and we define Fintech as “anything utilizing technology to improve an established process.” We realize that half of Fintech is financial, but we don’t invest in traditional, credit sensitive banks. Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent.We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow. From our perspective, the perfect example of a FINTECH business is the secularly growing payments industry. Names like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) or Mastercard, that generate revenue and profit per swipe or transaction, without the underlying credit sensitivity or risk associated with that underlying line of credit.”14.

(NYSE:FCX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Other top contributors during the quarter were copper producer Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) and health care facilities operator HCA Healthcare. With little fundamental news to report, Freeport-McMoRan’s share price advance in Q4 reflected a rebound in copper prices, driven by the recognition that copper inventories are low relative to historical norms. We believe the company continues to have meaningful price and volume leverage in a copper constrained world.”12.

Revenues grew 17% and were primarily driven by Cloud Services (up 29%) with Oracle’s cloud infrastructure (OCI) business growing 89% in the quarter. Oracle has messaged that this business has price-performance advantages as compared to the other infrastructure companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) and appears to be winning business as a result. On the earnings call, management made the case that OCI will play a significant role in the Generative AI workloads which bodes well for continued growth.”11. Adobe Inc.

The company also introduced some AI product enhancements, which seem to have helped shift the narrative from “AI is going to be bad for Adobe” to “AI is going to be good.” Finally, the company continues to work towards the Figma acquisition.It’s still uncertain whether antitrust regulators will allow this acquisition to close. That said, the stock seems to have been recovering from the initial reaction that the pricey acquisition indicated something more troubling about Adobe’s growth and competitive position. Solid ongoing fundaments have helped dispel that notion. We think it would be a big positive if the acquisition closes, but we remain confident in Adobe’s business even if it doesn’t.”10. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Ken Fisher's Stake: $2.7 billionKen Fisher’s hedge fund owns about $2.7 billion worth of The Home Depot, Inc.

This privileged position allows the company to capture value within the semiconductor ecosystem. You can see it in their margins and operating leverage. ASML’s customers are so eager for their products that they are willing to pay upfront, two years before a machine is even delivered! This is a testament to the company’s unrivalled capabilities and the high demand for its unique offerings. It will keep this privileged position as long as it continues to push the frontiers of chip density.ASML announced, this quarter, that their first High-NA machines (costing $200m per machine) are going to start shipping in 2024.

109,cd559ffb-657d-35ec-a6e6-4b0d101ac0de,MCD,2023-08-28,Read This Before Considering McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) For Its Upcoming US$1.52 Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/read-considering-mcdonalds-corporation-nyse-101958752.html,1693217998,STORY,['MCD'],"[Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next two days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase McDonald's' shares on or after the 31st of August, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 18th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.52 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$6.08 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, McDonald's has a trailing yield of approximately 2.1% on its current stock price of $284.58. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for McDonald's Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. McDonald's is paying out an acceptable 54% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Over the last year it paid out 65% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. For this reason, we're glad to see McDonald's's earnings per share have risen 11% per annum over the last five years. McDonald's is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. Given the quick rate of earnings per share growth and current level of payout, there may be a chance of further dividend increases in the future.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, McDonald's has lifted its dividend by approximately 7.0% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayHas McDonald's got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Higher earnings per share generally lead to higher dividends from dividend-paying stocks over the long run. However, we'd also note that McDonald's is paying out more than half of its earnings and cash flow as profits, which could limit the dividend growth if earnings growth slows. Overall we're not hugely bearish on the stock, but there are likely better dividend investments out there.On that note, you'll want to research what risks McDonald's is facing. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for McDonald's and you should be aware of these before buying any shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

Without commenting on Trustar's plan, MacDonald's China said it was ""highly confident"" about long-term sustainable growth in China.Story continuesMubadala declined to comment. GIC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.In 2017, Chicago-based McDonald's Corp sold an 80% stake in its Chinese operations to a group that included CITIC Ltd, its investment arm CITIC Capital, and Carlyle Group for up to $2.1 billion.Currently, Trustar owns 42% of the business, while Carlyle and CITIC own 28% and 10% respectively, according to McDonald's China.Carlyle has also been considering options for its stake in McDonald's China, including setting up a continuation fund, Reuters has reported.""McDonald's China will continue to leverage the capital and other resources from CITIC (Trustar), Carlyle, and McDonald's Corp to achieve the future milestone of 10,000 stores,"" said McDonald's China.Carlyle declined to comment.Bloomberg reported in July Carlyle and Trustar Capital were planning to raise $4 billion from wealth funds to buy part of their stakes in the business.(Reporting by Kane Wu in Hong Kong; additional reporting by Yantoultra Ngui in Singapore and Sophie Yu in Beijing; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee, Mark Potter and Louise Heavens)]"

If you want to skip our primer of cyclical stocks and the economy in general, then skip ahead to 5 Undervalued Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now. Stocks are divided into several categories and these primarily segregate them on the basis of industry. However, two categories classify stocks according to economic conditions. These are discretionary or cyclical stocks, and defensive stocks.These two categories list down companies whose fortunes either rise with the income that consumers have to spend or their ability to withstand economic slowdowns and resist a drop in purchasing power. Cyclical stocks are those that tend to do well when the economy is doing well and people have more money to spend. These generally include luxury goods companies such as jewelers, airlines, and restaurants. The logic goes that as people see their incomes rise in a growing economy and inflation remains low, they have more money to spend on luxury and naturally, cyclical stocks go up as a result.The other category, namely consumer defensive stocks, are those that are deemed too essential for daily living for people to skip out on even if the economy is slowing down. The rather cynical take surrounding them is that people cannot afford to skip out on buying essentials such as food and medicines even if their income is dropping. Naturally, this leads to defensive stocks being better off in share price performance in an era of slow economic growth. One of the most notable examples of a consumer defensive stock is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), whose low cost business model tends to attract consumers when their incomes drop.Today's high interest rate environment is one that is designed to benefit defensive stocks when we take an intuitive approach. After all, high rates slow down the economy and lead to poorer economic outcomes for most people. Yet, the current turmoil in the U.S. economy is rather historic in nature. 2022 was one of the worst years for the American consumer as high inflation, due to factors such as the $5 a gallon price for gasoline, squeezed consumer budgets dry. This left them with less discretionary income to make purchases and created a slow economic environment as purchases were instead redirected to essentials.Story continuesBut 2023 is proving to be a different economic landscape. Inflation in the U.S. currently sits at 3.2% which is significantly lower than the peak reading of 9.1% in June 2022. This drop in inflation frees up more money that people have to spend on luxury, and combined with the fact that the economy continues to grow, it can provide some stimulus to cyclical stocks despite the multi decade high interest rates right now. As any seasoned investor would tell you, investing is more about future expectations instead of current trends, as markets often react to potential future developments. As an example, it's a sure bet that the S&amp;P 500 will fall should the Federal Reserve's Chairman Jerome Powell surprise investors and share that the bank will raise interest rates throughout 2024 due to unforeseen circumstances.So, the next question to ask is what are the tea leaves saying for consumer cyclical stocks? Well, one way to judge consumer confidence is by taking a look at The Conference Board's consumer confidence survey. This survey measures consumer sentiment and the latest results were released in late July. They show that the index rose to 117 in July for a second consecutive month of gains and its highest reading since July 2021. Consumers were also quite confident about near term economic expectations, as the Expectations Index grew to 88.3 from the previous month's 80. 80 is a crucial reading for the expectations index since any reading below it reflects an incoming recession. Another crucial index is the University of Michigan's consumer surveys. The latest data set for August shows that consumer sentiment stood at its second highest level in 21 months and 39% higher than the lowest value in history that it had touched in June 2022 - when inflation was at its highest.With these details in mind, we decided to take a look at which undervalued consumer cyclical stocks are being favored by analysts. Some top picks are Burlington Stores, Inc. (NYSE:BURL), Cavco Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:CVCO), and Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA).15 Undervalued Cyclical Stocks To Buy NowSusan Law Cain / Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To compile our list of undervalued cyclical stocks to buy according to Wall Street analysts, we selected the top 15 stocks with the greatest percentage difference between their share price and average analyst price targets that have been rated Buy or higher.15 Undervalued Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now15.

112,d0cff587-ffca-367b-9659-bb64969ccc37,PLD,2023-08-28,20 Countries where Housing Prices are Declining or Flat,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-countries-where-housing-prices-183715980.html,1693161435,STORY,"['AMT', 'PLD', 'LEN-B']","[This article covers 20 Countries where Housing Prices are Declining or Flat, with insights into the current trends in housing prices in different countries across the globe. For a quick overview of the top 5, read our article 5 Countries Where Housing Prices are Declining. By the end of 2021, the global housing market was thriving. During this period, the real estate markets of 38 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) showed substantial growth. However, the entire situation changed in 2022 when homeowners across the globe started to experience a crisis. As inflation reared its ugly head in most major countries, central banks responded with raising interest rates. This led to a surge in mortgage payments for new buyers as well as existing borrowers that have variable interest rates. The surge in mortgage payments outpaced income growth and home affordability declined in most countries. As of 2023, the situation has still not improved despite International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s observations regarding the declining home values in several countries. IMF attributed the declines to the implementation of strict monetary policies and the rise in borrowing costs. The IMF also forecasted that in the next three years, the real prices of houses could go down by 25% in emerging markets. It further predicted that advanced economies could experience a decline in prices of around 10%. The Bank of Canada believes that a decline in the Canadian housing market could have an adverse impact on the economy as a whole. The bank estimated that economic growth could go down by 0.9% by the end of 2023. On the other hand, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) believes that the US will not be one of those countries where housing prices are declining or flat by the end of 2023. As per analysts of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), home prices have been forecasted to increase by 1.8% in 2023 and 3.5% in 2024. This indicates that Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) believes home prices will stay somewhat unchanged till year-end and start growing in 2024. Story continuesThe Chinese Housing Market in Disarray A recent development in the Chinese housing market is one of its biggest groups, Evergrande Group (OTCMKTS:EGRNF), filing for bankruptcy protection in the US. The Evergrande Group (OTCMKTS:EGRNF) has thus become the poster child for many countries with housing crises. As per Chapter 15 of the US bankruptcy code, the company has sought protection for its assets. It is believed that during this time, Evergrande Group (OTCMKTS:EGRNF) is going to attempt a restructuring deal. The company initially started struggling in 2021, when it reported over $300 billion in liabilities. In addition, two wholly owned subsidiaries of the Evergrande Group (OTCMKTS:EGRNF) have filed for bankruptcy. To make matters worse, property investment in China has gone down by 7.9% between 2022 and 2023 and is currently standing at $819.8 billion in the first half of 2023. A Peak into the US Housing MarketAs of now, the largest property investor in China, Evergrande Group (OTCMKTS:EGRNF) has filed for bankruptcy in the US, which is indicative of a decline in the housing market. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has shown confidence in the US housing market, stating that it already bottomed. With two conflicting situations at hand, people start to wonder whether they should invest in real estate assets, and which would be the best housing stocks to buy. Consequently, people turn to well-performing stocks to ascertain how well the US housing market is doing. These include Prologis Inc. (NYSE:PLD), Lennar Corp (NYSE:LEN), and American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), among others. Prologis Inc. (NYSE:PLD), a real estate investment trust, has a market capitalization of around $130 billion and a 10-year average yearly return of 15.6%. By the end of 2022, Prologis Inc. (NYSE:PLD) had property investments or ownership in various development projects, which totaled up to 1.2 billion square feet in 19 countries. The company recorded a share price of $111.12 at the end of 2022, while the price increased by 10% in 2023, currently standing at $122.66 in the second quarter. Lennar Corp (NYSE:LEN) is another crucial player that is currently performing well in the housing market. It has made headlines, especially after Warren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway disclosed his investments in the company to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The stock of Lennar Corp (NYSE:LEN) has gone up by 150% in the last five years, and its share price is readily increasing. The share price of the company was valued at $90.50 in December 2022, but it has since increased to $117 as of August 2023. The American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), a prominent real estate investment company, is also thriving as indicated by its average annual return of 12.2% over the last 10 years. The stock has an annual dividend yield of 3.4%. With a current market capitalization of $86 billion, American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) was in the portfolios of 60 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey.In 2022, American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) grew its annual revenue to $10.7 billion, an increase of 14.5% compared to the previous year. Nevertheless AMT shares lost close to 20% of their value so far in 2023 as analysts cut price targets of interest rate sensitive stocks like American Tower Corporation. We believe this may be a good time to buy AMT as the stock has rarely been this cheap.20 Countries where Housing Market is Declining or FlatGustavo Frazao/Shutterstock.comMethodologyWe put together a list of 20 countries where housing prices are declining or flat by evaluating countries with falling house prices. Our ranking included calculations based on two main metrics, namely the housing affordability and the housing price index.  The housing price index was further evaluated based on a 1-year % change and a 3-year % change in the housing prices in each country.  The reports used to collect data include Housing Prices data by the OECD and Global Housing Watch data by the IMF.  We first scored selected countries on each index from 1-20 (1 indicating the most declining housing market and 20 the least declining housing market on our list) to generalize the rankings. Then, we assigned weights of 0.45 each to 1-year % change and 3-year % change in the housing price index, as it is the core metric for the basis of our evaluation. Meanwhile, affordability was assigned a weight of 0.1. Consequently, a composite weighted average was calculated to conclude those countries where the housing market is declining or flat. After the final evaluation of the composite results, countries were ranked in descending order from 20-1. 20 indicated a country where the housing prices are decreasing the least, while 1 signified a country where housing prices have declined the most.  Below is our complete list of 20 countries where housing prices are declining or flat.20 Countries where Housing Prices are Declining or Flat20.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Now.The US stock markets are jumpy amid analyst firms downgrading banks and some analysts suggesting the economy is still not out the recession danger. Fitch recently warned that there’s a chance it might have to downgrade several US banks, including market leader JPMorgan. The news comes after Moody’s downgraded several banks. The industry has already seen the collapse of several regional banks earlier this year.While the US stock market rebounded earlier this year and latest inflation data pointed to cooling pricing pressures, some circles are seeing market optimism with skepticism. A Bloomberg report recently quoted Jonathan Millar, a senior economist at Barclays Capital Inc., who thinks that the picture will only be clear after at least two quarters. The analyst said that while inflation has come down, the Federal Reserve acknowledges the fact that the possibility of a soft landing “is far from assured.”Some analysts also believe that the real effects of the Federal Reserve’s incessant rate hikes are yet to be seen. A report or two showing signs of a slight decline in inflation would not be enough to label Fed’s action successful. In the past, whenever the Fed has slapped the economy with consistent rate hikes, the results were tough. A Bloomberg report quoted a study former Fed Vice Chair Alan Blinder, which studied and analyzed 11 monetary policy tightening from 1965 to 2022. Most of the studied hawkish steps caused “hard landings or a reacceleration in inflation two years later.” That means even if inflation comes down in the short term, there would always be a threat of it coming back. That’s why the Federal Reserve has been insisting to bring inflation down to 2%, but many analysts believe that target is too ambitious and might not be achieved even with more rate hikes without tipping the economy in recession.Story continuesIn this backdrop, it always makes sense to see which defensive stocks money managers and elite hedge funds are betting on. Defensive stocks are always relevant. They aren’t just for recessions or downturns. Having exposure to defensive plays ensures stable and reliable returns as many defensive companies are mature and market leaders with dividend payments and thriving business models.A 2012 research paper by AQR takes a look at detailed data-based evidence highlighting how low-risk, defensive stocks have outperformed volatile stocks over longer periods of time. The report says:Historically, risky securities have not generated higher risk- adjusted returns than safe securities within the same asset class. In other words, investors holding safe securities have received much higher compensation relative to the risk they bared. While academics initially referred to this effect as the “low-beta anomaly,” the evidence has been extended to include other risk measures beyond just beta: total volatility, idiosyncratic volatility as well as more fundamental measures of risk, generically referred to as “quality.”Best Defensive Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Kaleidico on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we first listed down all holdings of the Invesco Defensive Equity ETF (DEF). We then found the number of hedge fund investors for each of these holdings. We then picked 13 stocks from the resultant dataset with the highest number of hedge fund investors. These stocks, hence, are the best defensive stocks to buy according to hedge funds. We gauged hedge fund sentiment for stocks using Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors. The DEF ETF is based on the Invesco Defensive Equity Index (Index) which gives exposure to stocks that “have superior risk-return profiles during periods of stock market weakness while still offering the potential for gains during periods of market strength.”Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Now13. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75One of the biggest pharmaceutical companies, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a solid defensive play due to its pipeline and dividends. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) shares recently jumped after the company upped its full-year revenue guidance. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)’s Q2 revenue also remained upbeat amid growing sales of its cancer drug Keytruda and HPV vaccine, Gardasil.As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 75 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database were long Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). The biggest stakeholder of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) during this period was Cliff Asness’s AQR Capital Management which owns a $298 million stake in the company.Baron Health Care Fund made the following comment about Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“During the second quarter, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) filed the first lawsuit (followed by the filing of additional lawsuits by other parties) against the federal government challenging the constitutionality of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (the Program) that Congress established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. In Merck’s complaint, Merck argues that the Program violates the Fifth Amendment because it allows the federal government to take Merck’s innovative drugs without providing just compensation for them. In addition, Merck argues the Program violates the First Amendment because it forces them to sign an agreement saying the government mandated prices are fair and the result of a negotiation when in fact, Merck argues, prices are not negotiated or fair. These lawsuits will take time to work their way through the legal process and in the meantime, the Program moves ahead on its scheduled path. The consensus view is that these lawsuits will not be successful, and the Program will remain in place. We suspect Merck’s arguments may convince at least a few U.S. Supreme Court Justices when the case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, but the ultimate outcome is impossible to predict. For now, we assume the Program will remain in place and invest with that framework in mind.”12. AbbVie Inc.

We exited our position during the quarter. We sold AbbVie Inc. due to our less optimistic view of the company’s pipeline and long-term growth profile.”11.

CVS has been moving its portfolio to a more value-based outcome model, and Aetna was a major move in that direction. We were willing to accept the leverage that came with the deal because CVS has a very cash generative model, and we anticipated the free cash flow would enable the company to de-lever fairly quickly.By mid-2022, CVS was in a position to use the free cash flow that had been going to debt repayment to do bolt-on deals to further prepare for the value-based outcome model and/or return more cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or share repurchases. However, CVS lost a “star” in its largest Medicare plan in late 2022 and this will adversely impact earnings in 2024. This was a surprise and disappointment to us, but management should be able to regain the “star” in the back half of 2023, which will then give the company a nice tailwind in 2025…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

Originally McGraw-Hill Financial, the company changed its name in 2016. The company’s operations consist of five segments: ratings, commodity insights, indices, market intelligence and mobility.We see S&amp;P Global’s diversified business model as primarily subscription-based, which generates a sizeable recurring revenue stream and helps it navigate various market or macroeconomic environments. The company has a significant competitive advantage that provides substantial barriers to entry and sustainable competitive supremacy. We believe that technologyfocused strategic investments made over the past few years should help accelerate organic growth over the next few years, as the company continuously seeks to improve its existing offerings while striving to meet ever-evolving client needs.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:Goldman Sachs Dividend Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks15 Smallest Stocks In Warren Buffett’s PortfolioStanley Druckenmiller 13F Portfolio: Top 15 StocksDisclosure: None. 13 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

To see more such companies, go directly to Ken Fisher's Top 5 Stock Picks.Markets are still in a wait-and-see more as risks of inflationary pressures continue to haunt investors. Many believe the Federal Reserve’s battle against inflation is not over yet and if the central bank caps off its rate-hike spree to soon, chances are that inflation will make a comeback and haunt the economy for years. Amid the stock market rally this year, investors thought the stock market bears were on the retreat as recession warnings were going in the background. But as markets become jittery and pressures in the banking sector and China become visible, bear calls are getting more attention. A Bloomberg report recently cited Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of the Boston-based investment firm Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo, who reiterated his recession warnings. Otterloo said that his earlier recession warning was proven to be wrong because of the AI-led rally. But he believes “it’s perhaps too little too late to save us from a recession.”Many other analysts have been calling the AI-led rally short-lived. They say AI as entered the hype territory and pushed the valuations of tech stocks to dangerously high levels.  There are signs telling that the AI rally is about to end. The same Bloomberg report cited Emmanuel Cau, a strategist at Barclays Plc, who said in a note that the markets are facing a “perfect storm” amid bad news from China, “poor summer liquidity” and rate hikes.What's Behind Ken Fisher's Optimism?Despite the recession warnings, long-term analysts and successful investors like Ken Fisher believe now is the time to take opportunity from market swings. Markets rise and fall and it’s up to investors how they use these swings to their advantage. Billionaire Ken Fisher has been consistently optimistic over the past several months despite rate hikes, inflation, banking crisis and other doom and gloom calls. Other investors like Fisher who like to see their money stay invested in the market and enjoy the compounding effect also have the same stance. But why and how these investors can stay optimistic? A report by Russell Investments takes a look at the importance of “staying invested” in the stock market. The report analyzes stock market data spanning ten years. A hypothetical investment of CAD 100,000 in S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index would surge to $239,816 in ten years assuming that the investor remains invested in all days, including the bad and worst days. On the other hand, if the investor misses on just 10 “best days” the initial investment would surge to $147,184. The report mentions the results of missing other windows of best days, showing how important it is to stay invested in the stock market if ones does not want to miss out on the real gains of market upswings. The report adds:Story continuesStocks have historically outperformed bonds when based on average rolling returns over one, three, five, 10 and 20 years. Just as compelling is the traditional ability of a balanced portfolio to produce positive returns. ... A global balanced portfolio of equities and bonds has not produced a negative return over any five-year rolling period since 1979. The bottom line is that, although there are no guarantees the future will resemble the past, history tends to favour long-term investors.Seen in this perspective, it truly does not matter what happens to the market in the next few weeks. Given that one is invested in the right stocks or ETFs and let the market perform its wonders, short-term volatility should not affect the long-term investment outlook. Let’s see in what stocks billionaire Ken Fisher is invested in in the current environment.Ken Fisher's Top Stock Picks in 2023Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management Our MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Ken Fisher’s second quarter of 2023 portfolio and picked his top 15 holdings.

(NYSE:V) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We like to start out all of our discussions by telling investors who we are. We are FINTECH investors, and we define Fintech as “anything utilizing technology to improve an established process.” We realize that half of Fintech is financial, but we don’t invest in traditional, credit sensitive banks. Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent.We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow. From our perspective, the perfect example of a FINTECH business is the secularly growing payments industry. Names like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) or Mastercard, that generate revenue and profit per swipe or transaction, without the underlying credit sensitivity or risk associated with that underlying line of credit.”14. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Ken Fisher's Stake: $2 billionAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP) ranks 14th in our list of the top stock picks of Ken Fisher in 2023.

(NYSE:FCX).Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Other top contributors during the quarter were copper producer Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) and health care facilities operator HCA Healthcare. With little fundamental news to report, Freeport-McMoRan’s share price advance in Q4 reflected a rebound in copper prices, driven by the recognition that copper inventories are low relative to historical norms. We believe the company continues to have meaningful price and volume leverage in a copper constrained world.”12.

Revenues grew 17% and were primarily driven by Cloud Services (up 29%) with Oracle’s cloud infrastructure (OCI) business growing 89% in the quarter. Oracle has messaged that this business has price-performance advantages as compared to the other infrastructure companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) and appears to be winning business as a result. On the earnings call, management made the case that OCI will play a significant role in the Generative AI workloads which bodes well for continued growth.”11. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Ken Fisher's Stake: $2.4 billionAnother stock that is getting buoyed on the back of the AI boom, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is up about 51% year to date.

The company also introduced some AI product enhancements, which seem to have helped shift the narrative from “AI is going to be bad for Adobe” to “AI is going to be good.” Finally, the company continues to work towards the Figma acquisition.It’s still uncertain whether antitrust regulators will allow this acquisition to close. That said, the stock seems to have been recovering from the initial reaction that the pricey acquisition indicated something more troubling about Adobe’s growth and competitive position. Solid ongoing fundaments have helped dispel that notion. We think it would be a big positive if the acquisition closes, but we remain confident in Adobe’s business even if it doesn’t.”10. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Ken Fisher's Stake: $2.7 billionKen Fisher’s hedge fund owns about $2.7 billion worth of The Home Depot, Inc.

The company’s software subscription term-license model differs from the traditional perpetual-license software model in two respects: (1) the software is hosted on centralized servers and delivered over the internet, as opposed to traditional enterprise software that is loaded directly onto customers’ hard drives or servers; and (2) the revenue model is subscription-based, typically charging monthly fees per user as opposed to charging one-time licensing fees. The stock’s strong relative performance followed a strong F4Q23 earnings release that easily beat Street expectations on the top- and bottom-lines. In addition to the beat, management announced a number of initiatives that activist investors have been clamoring for, specifically a halt to large M&amp;A transactions and a focus on operating profitability.”8.

ASML’s customers are so eager for their products that they are willing to pay upfront, two years before a machine is even delivered! This is a testament to the company’s unrivalled capabilities and the high demand for its unique offerings. It will keep this privileged position as long as it continues to push the frontiers of chip density.ASML announced, this quarter, that their first High-NA machines (costing $200m per machine) are going to start shipping in 2024.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the cosmetics and aesthetics sector, head directly to 5 Best Cosmetic Surgery and Aesthetics Stocks to Buy.The American Society of Plastic Surgeons noted that numerous celebrities adopted a perspective favoring larger proportions through plastic surgery, where fuller breast and buttock sizes became the preferred aesthetic. However, there appears to be a shift in this trend in 2023. If really bold changes from plastic surgery are becoming less popular, they are being swapped for a more natural and authentic look in general. Dr. Ashley Amalfi, MD, who specializes in procedures for the breasts and body, has pointed out this change. Apart from the growing preference for a natural appearance, there are additional plastic surgery treatments that are becoming popular this year. Liposuction remains consistently trending, yet Amalfi has noticed a recent influx of patients seeking a distinct and tailored liposuction technique. She has shaped specific areas, like the lower part of the leg and the ankle, as per her patients’ requests. In addition to surgery, nonsurgical procedures remain popular in 2023. ASPS President Gregory Greco, DO, FACS, stated:""People are influenced by influencers. And I think we're seeing the more subtle, understated aesthetic in many celebrities.""Don't Miss: 12 Countries That Produce The Best CosmeticsAccording to Forbes, a report from 2021 about cosmetic surgeries and treatments in North America predicted that the market would keep growing steadily, increasing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 6.34% between 2021 and 2028. This number is on track to becoming a reality. Hollywood has often been seen as a major driving force behind the cosmetic surgery field. The fact that numerous celebrities have chosen cosmetic procedures to improve their appearance has naturally influenced others to do the same. One positive outcome of this trend is that it is gradually reducing the negative opinions often associated with cosmetic surgeries. As the field of cosmetic surgery continues to thrive, there have been significant advancements in technology for improving the quality of procedures. This progress is noticeable in the adoption of advanced tools like ultrasonic saws for different cosmetic treatments. The market is increasingly being linked with the fashion and beauty sector, even more than the medical field. Although cosmetic surgeries are accessible to everyone, 94% of procedures are sought by women. Furthermore, 43% of college-age individuals have expressed their readiness to consider more surgeries in the future. Cosmetic surgery is known for its relatively higher costs. Reports highlight that procedures like facelifts can begin at around $8000, excluding facility and additional expenses. However, the expense trend for cosmetic surgeries is shifting. The cost of procedures is decreasing mainly due to the increased number of available cosmetic surgeons and alternative treatments. Dr. Ali Esmail, an esteemed specialist in facial plastic reconstruction surgery, observed that this change is a direct response to the growing cultural acceptance of cosmetic surgeries. He commented:Story continues“Cosmetic surgeries are no longer such a taboo, it has become a popular option for people who want to improve their looks or well-being. The regularity means more demand and more supply, which affects cost.”According to Alliance Cosmetic Center, surgical enhancements for beauty have become a widespread practice worldwide, with the global cosmetic surgery market anticipated to reach $43.9 billion by 2025. Notably, around 20% of all cosmetic procedures take place in the United States. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) noted a 200% rise in non-invasive treatments such as botox and dermal fillers since 2000, with millennials showing the most interest. Such procedures are becoming increasingly popular in the United Kingdom. Dr. Jonquille Chantrey, a cosmetic surgeon and international aesthetic lecturer, stated:“Non-invasive procedures continue to rise in the UK far more than any other sector. People want comparable surgical results but without the risks and downtime. Botox remains extremely popular, but I’m seeing a huge increase in non-invasive body contouring and fat removal through machines such as CoolSculpting.”Also Read: 14 Best Beauty Stocks To Buy NowFortune Business Insights reported that in 2022, the worldwide market for cosmetic surgery was worth $55.68 billion. This value is expected to rise from $57.67 billion in 2023 to about $75.20 billion by the year 2030. This growth reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.9% over the forecast period. Every year, more and more people are turning to cosmetic procedures to enhance their looks. Additionally, the rise in dermatological issues and a substantial number of patients in need of treatment are driving up the demand for these procedures in the market. In addition to a number of patients going through surgeries, many people are now opting for simple and painless methods to achieve a youthful and healthy look without any issues. This trend is leading to a higher demand for non-surgical procedures. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a decrease in the global demand for cosmetic procedures. However, the market is expected to experience growth from 2023 to 2030 due to the relaxation of lockdown measures, a rising interest in home care procedures, and a focus on introducing advanced products to cater to this demand.To benefit from the growth potential in the fields of cosmetic surgery and aesthetics, some of the best stocks to buy include Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH), InMode Ltd. (NASDAQ:INMD), and Cutera, Inc. (NASDAQ:CUTR). Our Methodology We selected the following aesthetics stocks based on hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

120,0ea2f211-4ada-3603-a1e5-2504306f9c5a,RMD,2023-08-28,Buy the Drop: 3 Stocks to Snag After This Month’s 20% Tumble,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-drop-3-stocks-snag-202602705.html,1692649562,STORY,"['KEYS', 'RMD', 'SEE', 'A', '^GSPC']","[August has been a great month for investors looking for bargain stocks to buy on the dip. The S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq 100 were down 2,1%, 2.0%, and 2.4%, respectively, for the week of Aug. 14-18. Barron’s believes that September could be worse. If the past week is any indication, they could be on to something. Fundstrat analyst Tom Lee thinks August has been its typical mercurial self where gains are hard to come by and that the good times should return soon. Baron’s reported Lee’s comments from his Aug. 18 note to clients:“[T]he month’s declines haven’t shaken Lee’s core bullish thesis. ‘We see this more as ‘it’s August’ rather than the start of a larger rout…we are not in the camp this spills over into a wider selloff. That could happen, but more bad things need to emerge. In fact, there are some signs that we could see the stocks begin to stabilize soon.’”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, if you’re a risk-averse investor, you might want to wait a couple of weeks to see if the markets bottom. In the meantime, a quick screen of S&amp;P 500 stocks down more than 20% over the past month gives bargain-hunting investors 14 stocks to choose from. Here are three undervalued due to their 20%, including one name from three different sectors. Sealed Air (SEE)Source: ShutterstockSealed Air (NYSE:SEE) represents the materials sector. Its stock is down 25% for the past month and 31% year-to-date. Analysts are moderately optimistic about the stock, with 7 of the 15 rating it as Overweight or an outright Buy. It’s target price is $45 which is 31% higher than its current share price. One of the things that I use to assess value is free cash flow yield. If it’s over 8%, it’s definitely value. Between 4% and 8%, it’s reasonable value, if not dirt cheap. In the trailing 12 months ended June 30, its free cash flow was $152 million. Based on an enterprise value of $9.78 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 1.6%, which suggests it’s not cheap.Story continuesBefore you toss the company best known for bubble wrap packaging overboard, consider its historical FCF yield. In 2020, it had a free cash flow of $556 million. Based on an enterprise value of $10.6 billion. At first glance, it appears Sealed Air’s business has deteriorated. And to a certain extent, it has, which is why it’s moving forwqard with SEE 2.0. This revitalization plan should deliver $150 million in annual cost savings by the end of 2025 and a return to its historical earnings and sales growth in 2024. Its stock hasn’t been this low since June 2020. Get ready for a revival in the waning months of 2023 and into 2024.Keysight Technologies (KEYS)An image of waveforms.Source: fantasyform/Shutterstock.comKeysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) represents the tech sector. Its stock is down 23% for the past month and 24% year-to-date. Like Sealed Air, it hasn’t traded this low since 2020.Keysight is a relatively new company by S&amp;P 500 standards, incorporated in 2013. However, its history dates back to 1939 and Hewlett-Packard’s founding by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard. Their first product was an audio oscillator. Electronic measurement was their business.In 1999, Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) was formed to operate HP’s Medical Products and Instrument Group. In 2013, Agilent was split into two pure-play electronic measurement companies. Keysight was the one of the two, going public on November 1, 2014 after separating from Agilent. Agilent shareholders got one share of Keysight for two held by the parent. KEYS stock is up 335% since it began trading in November 2014. Agilent is up 191% over the same period.Shares have lost their mojo recently because the company reported Q3 2023 results on August 18th that included a downward revision of its guidance. It now expects fourth-quarter sales and earnings to decline by 10% and 13%, respectively. Currently trading at 4.16x sales — less than its five-year average of 5.1x — its enterprise value of $22.5 billion is 12.87x its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). That’s lower than it’s been since 2016.ResMed (RMD)ResMed logo on a tablet on a yellow background. RMD stock.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockResMed (NYSE:RMD) represents the healthcare sector. Its stock is down 25% for the past month and 21% year-to-date. Like the other two, it hasn’t traded this low since 2020.Interestingly, ResMed’s business is probably doing the best in terms of top-line growth among the trio, up 23% in Q4 2023 and 18% for all of 2023 to $4.2 billion. However, investors began to abandon the stock after hearing its gross margin (56.5%) and operating margin (29.0%) dropped for the year.    All of its stock losses in 2023 are post-earnings. Investors have rightly or wrongly decided that the contraction of its margins in light of double-digit revenue growth suggests the quality of the sales increase for the maker of sleep apnea equipment is suspect. ResMed CEO Mick Farrell is very confident about the future. He stated in the Q4 2023 conference call:“Patient demand continues to drive increased adoption and utilization of our mask resupply programs, augmenting a steady cadence of new patient setups. We continue to see strong growth in both the U.S. business where provider resupply programs have augmented growth and in our markets outside the U.S. where our consumer outreach and subscription programs are also driving mass replenishment directly with those end user patients.”Of the 24 analysts covering the stock, 18 rate it Overweight or an outright Buy with a $240 median price, 45% higher than its current share price. I see ResMed as the best long-term hold of the trio, although all three should make you money over 3-5 years.    On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to skip our primer of cyclical stocks and the economy in general, then skip ahead to 5 Undervalued Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now. Stocks are divided into several categories and these primarily segregate them on the basis of industry. However, two categories classify stocks according to economic conditions. These are discretionary or cyclical stocks, and defensive stocks.These two categories list down companies whose fortunes either rise with the income that consumers have to spend or their ability to withstand economic slowdowns and resist a drop in purchasing power. Cyclical stocks are those that tend to do well when the economy is doing well and people have more money to spend. These generally include luxury goods companies such as jewelers, airlines, and restaurants. The logic goes that as people see their incomes rise in a growing economy and inflation remains low, they have more money to spend on luxury and naturally, cyclical stocks go up as a result.The other category, namely consumer defensive stocks, are those that are deemed too essential for daily living for people to skip out on even if the economy is slowing down. The rather cynical take surrounding them is that people cannot afford to skip out on buying essentials such as food and medicines even if their income is dropping. Naturally, this leads to defensive stocks being better off in share price performance in an era of slow economic growth. One of the most notable examples of a consumer defensive stock is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), whose low cost business model tends to attract consumers when their incomes drop.Today's high interest rate environment is one that is designed to benefit defensive stocks when we take an intuitive approach. After all, high rates slow down the economy and lead to poorer economic outcomes for most people. Yet, the current turmoil in the U.S. economy is rather historic in nature. 2022 was one of the worst years for the American consumer as high inflation, due to factors such as the $5 a gallon price for gasoline, squeezed consumer budgets dry. This left them with less discretionary income to make purchases and created a slow economic environment as purchases were instead redirected to essentials.Story continuesBut 2023 is proving to be a different economic landscape. Inflation in the U.S. currently sits at 3.2% which is significantly lower than the peak reading of 9.1% in June 2022. This drop in inflation frees up more money that people have to spend on luxury, and combined with the fact that the economy continues to grow, it can provide some stimulus to cyclical stocks despite the multi decade high interest rates right now. As any seasoned investor would tell you, investing is more about future expectations instead of current trends, as markets often react to potential future developments. As an example, it's a sure bet that the S&amp;P 500 will fall should the Federal Reserve's Chairman Jerome Powell surprise investors and share that the bank will raise interest rates throughout 2024 due to unforeseen circumstances.So, the next question to ask is what are the tea leaves saying for consumer cyclical stocks? Well, one way to judge consumer confidence is by taking a look at The Conference Board's consumer confidence survey. This survey measures consumer sentiment and the latest results were released in late July. They show that the index rose to 117 in July for a second consecutive month of gains and its highest reading since July 2021. Consumers were also quite confident about near term economic expectations, as the Expectations Index grew to 88.3 from the previous month's 80. 80 is a crucial reading for the expectations index since any reading below it reflects an incoming recession. Another crucial index is the University of Michigan's consumer surveys. The latest data set for August shows that consumer sentiment stood at its second highest level in 21 months and 39% higher than the lowest value in history that it had touched in June 2022 - when inflation was at its highest.With these details in mind, we decided to take a look at which undervalued consumer cyclical stocks are being favored by analysts. Some top picks are Burlington Stores, Inc. (NYSE:BURL), Cavco Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:CVCO), and Ulta Beauty, Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the Top 5 Largest Timber Exporting Countries in the World.Timber refers to wood fiber which is specifically used for building structures. A stage in wood production where wood can produce a minimum dimensional size can be classified as timber. Thus, processed beams and planks are timber. It is also referred to as lumber in the United States and Canada.Timber can be divided into hardwood and softwood. Hardwood comes from an angiosperm tree. The timber obtained from hardwood trees is generally dense and heavy as these trees grow slower and take almost 150 years to harvest. Examples of hardwoods include walnut, ash maple, and oak. On the contrary, softwood timber is derived from gymnosperm and this timber is lightweight since it grows faster and becomes ready to harvest in almost 40 years. Softwood timber includes cedars, spruces, firs, and pines.The Timber IndustryThe timber industry is an important part of the global wood market. Timber is any wood that is sewn into planks and beams. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the sawn wood market is currently valued at $751.77 million and is expected to grow to $780 million in 2028 at a compound annual growth rate of 0.74%.Asia Pacific serves to dominate the timber market by its high market share. The high market share is due to increased incomes, urbanization, and population growth. The timber consumption rates are high, especially in countries like China. China is one of the world’s largest importers of sawn wood. This can be attributed to the Chinese furniture market. The main producers of timber in the APAC region include countries like India, Malaysia, and Vietnam.The fastest growing region around the world is North America which is expected to grow at a high compound annual growth rate till 2028. However, Latin America and Middle East Africa have low market shares.Story continuesIn another report by Fact.MR, it was reported that Europe is the leading manufacturer of sawn timber. This region is also following green building codes so they consume wood as a sustainable option in buildings, thereby decreasing carbon footprint.Noteworthy Names in the Timber IndustrySome of the known timber market players in the United States include UFP Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:UFPI), Boise Cascade Company (NYSE:BCC), Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY), and Jewett Cameron Trading Co (NASDAQ:JCTCF).UFP Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:UFPI) is a Michigan-based company that started off as a lumber supplier for manufacturing houses. Now, it operates in retail, packaging, and construction segments. It supplies wood and non-wood composites in Asia, North America, Australia, and Europe. On August 22, Business Wire reported that UFP Packaging, a subsidiary of UFP Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:UFPI), will be launching its packaging solutions in the form of wood pallets, wooden crates, and even customized label packaging at its Las Vegas' PACK Expo that will be held in the coming month of September on September 11-13. PACK Expo is an event conducted for suppliers of packaging to showcase their solutions for different industries.Boise Cascade Company (NYSE:BCC) is another leading name in the North American lumber industry. It produces lumber, panels, and engineered wood products for the residential and construction markets. On August 23, the company reported that it would be acquiring Brockway-Smith, a distributor of millwork and doors. Since Boise Cascade Company (NYSE:BCC) also specializes in wood mill-produced materials for construction, the two firms tend to be of similar nature. Commenting on this upcoming acquisition, Jeff Strom, Executive Vice President, Building Materials Distribution, said:“BROSCO is a long-standing industry leader in the Northeast region known for high-capacity manufacturing, quality artisanship, and a loyal customer base. This acquisition furthers our strategy to expand our millwork business. We are excited to bring this outstanding team on board.”Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY) is one of the largest wood product manufacturers. It owns many hectares of forests in the United States and works as a real estate investment trust. On July 27, the company reported its financial performance for the second quarter of 2023, hoping to maintain its financial position after acquiring 22,000 acres of timberland in Mississippi, US. On August 22, MSN reported that a former Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY) building in Everett which used to hold administration offices for the company, was transformed into a coffee and cocktail house. Furthermore, the original woodwork in the building was maintained and QR codes were installed for customers to learn more about the building's history.Based in Oregon, Jewett Cameron Trading Co (NASDAQ:JCTCF) manufactures and distributes wood products. It operates in the US, Canada, Europe, Mexico, and Asia Pacific through three segments. The first segment, Industrial Wood Products supplies industrial wood. The Pet, Fencing and Other segment engages in producing fencing and pet supplies. Furthermore, the company also distributes seeds for agriculture through its Seed Processing and Sales segment. On July 13, the company reported results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. It made $18.9 million in revenue as compared to last year’s $20.9 million. Elaborating on the decline in sales for the third quarter of 2023, here is what the CEO, Chad Summers, said:“The winter weather which covered much of the US into April had a negative effect on our 3rd quarter sales, as many of our customers delayed, and then reduced, purchases of our outdoor products”Jewett Cameron Trading Co (NASDAQ:JCTCF) has also decided to wrap up its seed segment by the end of 2023.Recent Trends and ChallengesThe timber industry has given rise to the trend of low-carbon constructions. Timber is considered to be less carbon-intensive and hence it plays a significant role in energy efficiency. Thus, the carbon footprints of buildings are being reduced. Mass timber is being consumed for this purpose. An example of this emerging trend is Walmart Inc.'s (NYSE:WMT) Bentonville-based home office which will be launched by 2025. In this regard,  Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) reported that the new home office will comprise 12 buildings in a 2.4 million square feet of mass timber construction. For this purpose, 1.7 million cubic feet of lumber is being locally sourced by Walmart Inc.(NYSE:WMT).The demand for the timber market keeps on increasing. An increase in income has led to a rise in the consumption of timber since it implies more money spent on housing and building. Furthermore, urbanization and high population growth in countries around the world have also led to an increase in the demand for timber. Flooring, fencing, furniture making, and construction also require timber which further boosts this market. Sawn timber is also being used in the production of pallets. These pallets are utilized for packaging.However, this industry is subject to concerns related to deforestation and its impact on biodiversity. This is evident from the New South Wales' situation regarding the timber market. On August 26, MSN reported that bans on logging are to be imposed in surrounding areas like Victoria and Western Australia. Hence, the timber workers in New South Wales are worried about their future. A Great Koala National Park has also been announced by the government in the thick forests of the region. Only a minor portion of the native forests is available for timber harvesting. In this condition, the task at hand is to accommodate the Koalas in a natural habitat while preserving the timber market which fuels the economy of New South Wales.Now that we have taken a look at the timber industry and its current situation, we can move to the top 20 largest timber exporting countries.Top 20 Largest Timber Exporting Countries in the WorldJosef Hanus/Shutterstock.comMethodologyIn order to find out the top 20 largest timber exporting countries in the world, we sourced data from the FAO Forestry Production and Trade Database. We carried out extensive research to see how timber is represented in this database. FAO reports that it “segregates timber products into 5 general categories: roundwood, sawnwood and sleepers, wood-based panels, wood pulp, paper and paperboard”. Here, roundwood includes both industrial roundwood and non-industrial roundwood.Furthermore, non-industrial roundwood is excluded from the trade data on FAO as it has a low value per unit of volume. Thus, excluding non-industrial roundwood, we considered the categories of industrial roundwood, sawnwood and sleepers, wood-based panels, wood pulp, paper and paperboard to define ‘timber’. We used export volume as of 2021 as a metric. Please note that ‘timber’ represents the above categories whenever mentioned in this article. We added the dollar value of exports for all timber categories to find the total export volume, as quoted in the rankings. Finally, we ranked the top 20 largest timber exporting countries in ascending order of the dollar value of their exports, as follows:Top 20 Largest Timber Exporting Countries in the World20.

To see the top 5 stocks in this list click Ken Fisher's Top 5 Growth Stock Picks.Markets struggled to find a direction on August 25 following mixed comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. While Powell acknowledged that inflation came down from its peak levels, he’s still concerned about high consumer spending and believes further signs of strong activity and economic growth could force the central bank to increase interest rates. Despite this clear stance, some analysts and investors still believe stocks will ultimately come out of the woods and the US will not face a full-fledge recession.Billionaire Ken Fisher is one of the strongest voices of optimism in the current scenario. He’s consistently said that markets are overeacting to inflation and rate hikes and stocks will rebound and now is the time to pile into equities. He isn’t alone in this optimism. Gabriela Santos, JPMorgan Asset Management global market strategist, recently said while talking to CNBC that the markets are back to the “normal” period of volatility in equity markets. The analyst said that profit taking, CPI, seasonal effects and other factors could affect stock prices but ultimately she has a constructive view on the stock market.Top Growth Stock Picks of Ken FisherMethodologyFor this article we scanned Ken Fisher’s second quarter of 2023 portfolio and picked top 15 growth stocks the billionaire had stakes in. We gave preference to technology stocks with high PE ratios which also have strong growth catalysts.15. Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER)Ken Fisher's Stake: $400,000,000According to Yahoo Finance, Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER)’s forward PE ratio stands at 81 as of August 25. The ride-hailing company’s revenue in the second quarter jumped 14% on a YoY basis.Ken Fisher’s hedge fund owns a $400 million stake in the company.Story continuesUber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER)’s CEO said the following about the company’s delivery business in Uber’s Q2 earnings call:“…When we look at the Delivery business, we’re actually quite pleased with the trends there. Last quarter, we grew at about 12% constant currency, that accelerated to 14% constant currency. This quarter, certainly New Verticals was a help. But we continue to drive higher frequency as a higher percentage of our bookings come from our members, as we improve the service, as we improve the average delivery times to our consumer as well, and generally basket sizes are positive there. So again, you break down the growth in terms of audience, frequency and price, and all of those are positive factors in terms of our Delivery business. And going forward, we expect growth consistent with what we saw this quarter or accelerating even from this quarter as well, depending on the marketplace, the competitive position and how things shake out.But generally, we’re quite confident of Delivery top-line growth going forward. And we think the penetration in these markets is very low. So, in many of our developed markets there, significant markets there, we’ve wired up anywhere from 20% of restaurants to, call it, 40% of restaurants in a particular market. So, if you think about just all of the inventory out there, these restaurants are in the marketplace. They’ve got loyal clients. They’re servicing their local communities. And we think as we wire them up, then naturally more people want delivery, because it’s another way of staying connected, it’s another way of getting great food whenever you want on a on-demand basis. So, we think that with the very early penetration into the total restaurant in our major markets being, call it, a range of 20% to 40%, we’ve got a long, long runway ahead of us.”14. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Ken Fisher's Stake: $770,458,000Digital workflows and enterprise operations management software company ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) ranks 14th in our list of the top growth stock picks of Ken Fisher. As of the end of the second quarter, Fisher’s hedge fund owns a $770 million stake in the company. Stifel recently downgraded Datadog and said it prefers companies like ServiceNow (NOW), MongoDB (MDB), Snowflake (SNOW) and Dynatrace (DT) in the infrastructure space.During a latest earnings call, ServiceNow’s management talked generative AI and its collaboration with Nvidia.“Our good friend, NVIDIA Co-Founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, joined us at Knowledge ‘23 earlier this year. And Jensen stated the expanded NVIDIA-ServiceNow partnership is really important. Their partnership of choice for enterprise IT. He thinks it’s an exciting growth opportunity for both companies. We agree. We’re in the midst of a dramatic expansion of the software economy. In 2023 alone, IDC says Platform-as-a-Service spending will grow 30%, and Software-as-a-Service applications will grow 17%. When you correlate that to ServiceNow’s platform and our workflow leadership, it’s clear we live in a great neighborhood on a super nice street, and maybe we’re in the best house.With regard to artificial intelligence, especially large language models, ServiceNow strategy has been laser-focused for years. We accelerated that focus with our Element AI acquisition in 2020. Today, by some estimates, Generative AI could boost global GDP by almost $7 trillion. We see unprecedented parallel adoption across consumer and the enterprise. Our platform experts, who have worked for the greatest brands and technology believe this moment is as transformative, if not even more so than the Internet or even the iPhone. But they’re careful to remind me, it’s all about delivering enterprise-grade, domain-specific large language models, which is the core of ServiceNow’s AI strategy. These models will improve the accuracy results, leveraging a customer’s enterprise data in alignment with their business rules, while maintaining the highest ethical standards for data privacy.”13.

Instead, a VPP uses advanced software to aggregate and coordinate the functions of a collection of small-scale, decentralized resources located at customers' homes and businesses to meet grid needs. A VPP network can comprise a wide range of devices and resources – everything from home appliances such as electric vehicles and chargers to HVAC equipment and solar plus battery energy storage systems. Software programs run VPPs in concert with grid operations to dispatch communications signals to devices in the VPP network to either power down or discharge electricity from existing resources back to the grid.""The beauty of a virtual power plant is it can leverage existing resources to provide significant grid reliability benefits – with zero incremental emissions,"" said SDG&amp;E Chief Commercial Officer Miguel Romero. ""When hundreds or thousands of businesses or homes are connected to a VPP and their resources are flexibly managed to charge or discharge electrons, they can help keep the lights on during hot summer days.""In August, as temperatures soared, SDG&amp;E deployed its VPP pilot three times to support the grid during peak demand periods. Connected devices functioned as expected. Because of how well the pilot project has performed, SDG&amp;E is considering expanding the program to other areas in the future.Story continuesSDG&amp;E's VPP pilot is different from most other VPPs because of the diversity of devices it has integrated into a centralized system. Most VPPs typically involve only one brand or one type of device (e.g., battery energy storage). SDG&amp;E's VPP involves multiple brands and types of devices including smart thermostats, well water controllers and battery energy storage systems. The pilot is taking place in Shelter Valley, a remote community in eastern San Diego County about an hour and a half drive from central San Diego.Participants in the pilot include single-family homes with existing rooftop solar and the Shelter Valley Community Center, which serves as a resource center for the community during emergencies. The center received free installation of two batteries onsite.""We can use this equipment to maintain a place for people if the power goes off and keep the center cool and hope we can provide food if needed for our community residents,"" said Shelter Valley Community Center Board President Steve Bassett, who believes the project will better prepare the community for emergencies.When VPP participants receive a message about the potential for their devices to be turned off or discharge electricity to support the grid, they can opt out for certain devices (except battery storage). So far, the opt-out rate has been very low. The pilot first came online last December and will run through December 2023. Since the start of the pilot, the VPP has been tested through 17 simulated demand response events.More about the Shelter Valley VPP Pilot Project HERE.SDG&amp;E is an innovative energy delivery company that provides clean, safe and reliable energy to better the lives of the people it serves in San Diego and southern Orange counties.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 Biggest Companies in the World by 2023 Revenue.The biggest companies in the world by 2023 revenue operate within a range of different market sectors, including retail, healthcare, technology, and oil and gas. First, let’s take a look at what some of the biggest companies in the world by revenue are up to.Retail Giants Raise the BarThe retail market ranks among the top industries in the world. Retailing involves buying directly from producers or from wholesalers, exhibiting products for sale either in-stores or online, and now it can sometimes also include delivery. According to Research and Markets, the global retail market was valued at around $26.2 trillion in 2022. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.4% during 2023-2027, propelling the market to reach $37.6 trillion by the end of the forecasted period.E-commerce or online retail remains the fastest growing segment in the retail industry. With the growth of mobile devices and internet services, e-commerce has become a major shopping platform around the world. Companies in this space are working to improve customer satisfaction by offering a wide variety of different and customized items as well as quick deliveries. On July 31, Bloomberg reported that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has announced their plans of doubling the number of US same-day delivery facilities in the coming years. Speedy delivery is of vital importance for the online shopping market leader. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also said that it has delivered more than 1.8 billion units to Prime members in the US with same-day or one-day delivery so far this year, up about four times from the same period in 2019. Unlike bigger warehouses that are located near highways on the outskirts of cities, same-day facilities are smaller and closer to major population centers and allow Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to fulfill, sort, and deliver all from one site to accelerate the entire process of delivering customer packages.Story continuesSome of the biggest companies in the retail and e-commerce markets are also increasingly investing in drones to reduce delivery times and boost profitability. On August 24, Bloomberg reported that Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is teaming up with Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Wing unit and planning its longest drone deliveries yet from two Dallas-area stores. According to the report, the Wing drones will be able to drop off household essentials and food items as far as 6 miles from the store and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) expects to be able to offer drone coverage to around 60,000 homes. This partnership marks a significant expansion in drone service and also shows how serious some of the retail giants are about using robotic aircraft to serve their customers.Companies in Technology, Healthcare, and Energy to Reach New HeightsOn July 19, Bloomberg reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is quietly working on AI tools that could challenge OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Bard and others. The company has built its own framework, known as ‘Ajax’, to create large language models, while also testing a chatbot that some engineers call ‘Apple GPT’. Generative AI has the potential to change how people interact with phones, computers and other technology, and Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices could suffer if the big tech giant doesn’t keep up with AI advancements. According to the report, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has yet to devise a clear strategy for releasing the technology to consumers, but the people familiar with the effort believe that the company is aiming to make a significant AI-related announcement next year.The leading companies in the healthcare industry are working to provide a better quality of care as well as patient satisfaction. It is a massive industry, and it continues to grow as the population swells. According to the latest market research reports, future trends in healthcare include adoption of emerging health-focused technology. On August 11, Reuters reported that Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has provisionally cleared UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (NYSE:UNH) $1.58 billion acquisition of the UK healthcare technology firm EMIS Group plc (LON:EMIS) as it found no competition concerns in the deal between specialist health care tech and software companies. UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) is one of the largest healthcare companies in the world, and it operates in the UK as Optum. It supplies software used by general practitioners within the National Health Service (NHS) to prescribe medicines to patients. Acquisition of EMIS Group plc is expected to bring more advanced technology solutions and capabilities to the NHS, and help general practitioners to improve patient care.On June 1, Reuters reported that with the help of new technologies, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is looking to double the amount of oil produced from its shale holdings in the US over a period of five years. In December 2022, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) had set a goal to produce between 900,000 to 1 million barrels of oil per day in the top US shale field, Permian Basin, by 2027, while also announcing plans for a five-year technology development programme. The post mentions that the CEO of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Darren Woods, said that they currently recover about 10% of shale resources from its operations and that a lot of oil is still being left in the ground. Developing new technology will help Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) better identify acquisition targets as well as keep the fracks open better in order to boost oil flow and significantly improve recovery.Now that we've discussed what some of the leading companies in some of the biggest industries are up to, let's take a look at the 30 biggest companies in the world by revenue as of 2023.30 Biggest Companies in the World by 2023 RevenueMethodologyIn this article, we have listed the 30 biggest companies in the world by 2023 revenue.

131,fb13b3b1-98cd-3a22-865e-7d3f3cdb4d41,ADP,2023-08-28,7 Top Dividend Stocks for Income and Stability,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-top-dividend-stocks-income-010345058.html,1692666225,STORY,"['ABBV', 'CVX', 'LMT', 'ADP', 'PEP', 'LOW']","[When it comes to investing in dividend stocks, some investors focus mainly on yield. This can sometimes lead to investing too heavily in stocks that, while offering a high yield, could end up becoming dividend traps, whether from cutting/suspending their dividends, and/or from shares declining in value, outweighing the large payouts. Other investors focus on dividend growth. They seek to buy and hold stocks with a history of increasing their payouts steadily over time. This strategy also has its flaws.Namely, there are many dividend-paying stocks that are able to raise payouts above their rate of earnings growth for some time, but end up hitting a wall once their payout ratios start approaching the 100% mark.With this in mind, a strong dividend investing strategy may be to focus on high-quality names that score well on several dividend-related metrics. In other words, besides yield and dividend growth history, payout ratios/dividend coverage, as well as the underlying strength of the company’s business, should be taken into consideration, as well. Applying this filter brings us to names like these seven top dividend stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAbbVie (ABBV)Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USASource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comPharmaceutical giant Abbvie (NYSE:ABBV) is well-regarded as a dividend stock for income. Not only does ABBV offer investors a moderately-high dividend yield (3.94%), but it’s also been increased for many years. Over the past five years, the average dividend growth rate for ABBV stock has been around 12.3%. With a payout ratio of 46.3%, considered healthy by dividend-focused investors, AbbVie’s dividend policy is likely sustainable, even as sell-side forecasts call for sluggish earnings growth in the coming year.As InvestorPlace’s Alex Siriois recently argued, the decline of Humira (Abbvie’s flagship drug) has been what has driven the recent slump in the company’s results. However, with growing sales for newer drugs like Rinvoq picking up the slack, Abbvie is well-positioned to experience re-accelerated earnings growth. This, of course, bodes well for both ABBV’s future payouts and future stock price.Story continuesAutomatic Data Processing (ADP)In this photo illustration the stock market information of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. displays on a smartphone with the logo of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ADP stock.Source: IgorGolovniov / ShutterstockTake a look at recent commentary regarding Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), and you’ll see plenty of articles arguing that the stock is overvalued. However,  while Automatic Data Processing’s current valuation (27.5 times earnings) is a bit rich, this premium multiple for ADP stock may be sustainable. That’s thanks to the company’s high projected earnings growth.Along with the potential for this venerable, deep-moat business to continue growing earnings, ADP is also likely to maintain its decades-long streak of annual dividend growth. ADP’s 1.99% dividend has increased by an average of 13.7% annually over the past five years. With its strong potential to keep producing above-average returns, consider it one of the top dividend stocks.Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with ""diesel"" and ""food mart"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAmong major integrated oil and gas stocks, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) may be your best choice, if you’re looking for income and stability. What makes this big oil name the best of the bunch when it comes to its qualities as a less-risky dividend stock?For starters, CVX stock offers a higher dividend yield than comparable U.S.-based big oil stocks like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP). XOM and COP’s forward yields are 3.31% and 1.74%, respectively.Not only that, besides offering a higher yield, CVX is a “Dividend Aristocrat” – a company that increased its dividend for more than 25 years. In fact, Chevron has 35 years of dividend growth under its belt, with payouts increasing by an average of 6% annually over the past five years. If you’re bullish that crude oil’s recent rebound will continue, consider CVX.Lockheed Martin (LMT)Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner onSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is another name that belongs on your list of blue-chip dividend stocks. Shares in this defense contractor have yet to attain dividend aristocrat status, but they’re getting close. Hitting 20 years of consecutive dividend growth this year, LMT is just five years away from joining the club.However, that’s not the sole reason to add LMT stock to your portfolio. The main reason to do so is the fact this stock is another name that could deliver above-average total returns, through both growth and yield. Rising geopolitical tensions bode well for Lockheed Martin’s future results. Thanks to strong weapons demand, the company recently raised its full-year guidance.Growth from this tailwind stands to be boosted by LMT’s dividend. The stock today has a forward dividend yield of 2.67%, and LMT’s payout has increased by an average of 8.6% annually over the past five years.Lowe’s (LOW)the front of a Lowe's storeSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comIf steady dividend growth is a high priority, look no further than Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW). This home improvement retailer stock is not just a “Dividend Aristocrat,” but also a “Dividend King.” As I’ve noted previously, LOW has increased its dividend 59 years in a row.Cash dividends for LOW stock have really increased over the past five years, rising by an average of nearly 20% annually. Sure, even as the company currently pays out just 30.2% of its earnings as dividends, future dividend growth may come at a far less rapid pace. Yet in the event this happens, Lowe’s shares could still continue to perform well.Between the implementation of its “total home strategy” for organic growth, coupled with the company’s aggressive use of stock buybacks, Lowe’s has a strong chance of experiencing earnings growth in the coming years, with shares likely to move higher in line with this growth.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is a strong choice among dividend stocks in the consumer staples sector. Shares in the soft drink and snack foods behemoth just hit “Dividend King” status, and currently sport a forward yield of 2.84%.Yes, the payout ratio for PEP stock is somewhat high, coming in currently at 65.2%. However, the company could keep raising its dividend, while at the same time not deviating too far above this payout level. Despite headwinds like inflation, Pepsico has managed to keep reporting strong “beat and raise” quarterly results.With the inflation issue seemingly subsiding, PEP looks even more well-positioned to keep increasing its bottom line. Sell-side forecasts call for earnings growth of around 7.75% next year, and around 8.2% the year after that. This points to further dividend increases. Shares could also move higher in tandem with these increasing earnings.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) has been one of the top large-cap growth stocks of the past decade. While the company has a moderately-sized dividend (1.51% forward yield), with dividend growth averaging 16.7% annually over the past five years, UNH’s payouts could increase at a faster clip than earnings, resulting in a higher yield over time.Previously, I have pointed out that above-average earnings growth will lead to strong gains for UnitedHealth Group shares in the years ahead. Looking at the latest earnings forecasts, I stand by this past view. The company is expected to report double-digit increases in its earnings per share both in 2024 and 2025.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceMusk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

135,c59de39f-3d37-3a0c-896c-f9a7f9414708,FCX,2023-08-28,Ken Fisher’s Top 15 Stock Picks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ken-fisher-top-15-stock-130958990.html,1693141798,STORY,"['ADBE', 'AMD', 'FCX', 'ORCL', 'ASML', 'V', 'TSM', 'HD', 'CRM', 'AXP']","[In this article, we will take a look at Ken Fisher's top 15 stock picks. To see more such companies, go directly to Ken Fisher's Top 5 Stock Picks.Markets are still in a wait-and-see more as risks of inflationary pressures continue to haunt investors. Many believe the Federal Reserve’s battle against inflation is not over yet and if the central bank caps off its rate-hike spree to soon, chances are that inflation will make a comeback and haunt the economy for years. Amid the stock market rally this year, investors thought the stock market bears were on the retreat as recession warnings were going in the background. But as markets become jittery and pressures in the banking sector and China become visible, bear calls are getting more attention. A Bloomberg report recently cited Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of the Boston-based investment firm Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo, who reiterated his recession warnings. Otterloo said that his earlier recession warning was proven to be wrong because of the AI-led rally. But he believes “it’s perhaps too little too late to save us from a recession.”Many other analysts have been calling the AI-led rally short-lived. They say AI as entered the hype territory and pushed the valuations of tech stocks to dangerously high levels.  There are signs telling that the AI rally is about to end. The same Bloomberg report cited Emmanuel Cau, a strategist at Barclays Plc, who said in a note that the markets are facing a “perfect storm” amid bad news from China, “poor summer liquidity” and rate hikes.What's Behind Ken Fisher's Optimism?Despite the recession warnings, long-term analysts and successful investors like Ken Fisher believe now is the time to take opportunity from market swings. Markets rise and fall and it’s up to investors how they use these swings to their advantage. Billionaire Ken Fisher has been consistently optimistic over the past several months despite rate hikes, inflation, banking crisis and other doom and gloom calls. Other investors like Fisher who like to see their money stay invested in the market and enjoy the compounding effect also have the same stance. But why and how these investors can stay optimistic? A report by Russell Investments takes a look at the importance of “staying invested” in the stock market. The report analyzes stock market data spanning ten years. A hypothetical investment of CAD 100,000 in S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index would surge to $239,816 in ten years assuming that the investor remains invested in all days, including the bad and worst days. On the other hand, if the investor misses on just 10 “best days” the initial investment would surge to $147,184. The report mentions the results of missing other windows of best days, showing how important it is to stay invested in the stock market if ones does not want to miss out on the real gains of market upswings. The report adds:Story continuesStocks have historically outperformed bonds when based on average rolling returns over one, three, five, 10 and 20 years. Just as compelling is the traditional ability of a balanced portfolio to produce positive returns. ... A global balanced portfolio of equities and bonds has not produced a negative return over any five-year rolling period since 1979. The bottom line is that, although there are no guarantees the future will resemble the past, history tends to favour long-term investors.Seen in this perspective, it truly does not matter what happens to the market in the next few weeks. Given that one is invested in the right stocks or ETFs and let the market perform its wonders, short-term volatility should not affect the long-term investment outlook. Let’s see in what stocks billionaire Ken Fisher is invested in in the current environment.Ken Fisher's Top Stock Picks in 2023Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management Our MethodologyFor this article, we scanned Ken Fisher’s second quarter of 2023 portfolio and picked his top 15 holdings. The list is ranked in ascending order of Fisher’s stake value in these companies.Ken Fisher's Top 15 Stock Picks15. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Ken Fisher's Stake: $2 billionVisa Inc. (NYSE:V) ranks 15th in our list of the top 15 stock picks of billionaire Ken Fisher. Fisher’s hedge fund had a stake worth over $2 billion in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 171 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). Visa Inc.

(NYSE:V) is benefitting from summer tourism and a broader recovery in travel.Manole Capital Management made the following comment about Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We like to start out all of our discussions by telling investors who we are. We are FINTECH investors, and we define Fintech as “anything utilizing technology to improve an established process.” We realize that half of Fintech is financial, but we don’t invest in traditional, credit sensitive banks. Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent.We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow. From our perspective, the perfect example of a FINTECH business is the secularly growing payments industry. Names like Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) or Mastercard, that generate revenue and profit per swipe or transaction, without the underlying credit sensitivity or risk associated with that underlying line of credit.”14. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)Ken Fisher's Stake: $2 billionAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP) ranks 14th in our list of the top stock picks of Ken Fisher in 2023. Fisher Asset Management owns a $2 billion stake in the payments giant.American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)’s US consumer credit card delinquency rate was 1.1% in July, unchanged from June.ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:” Other financial holdings were among the top contributors, such as American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), whose business is less sensitive to changes in the yield curve than most financials, and Progressive, which has minimal interest rate mismatch exposure.”13. Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX)Ken Fisher's Stake: $2.2 billionFreeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) ranks 13th in our list of the top 15 stock picks of billionaire Ken Fisher.

Revenue in the quarter jumped 5.9% year over year to $5.74 billion, beating estimates by $80 million. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, Ken Fisher’s hedge fund had a $2.2 billion stake in Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX).Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Other top contributors during the quarter were copper producer Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) and health care facilities operator HCA Healthcare. With little fundamental news to report, Freeport-McMoRan’s share price advance in Q4 reflected a rebound in copper prices, driven by the recognition that copper inventories are low relative to historical norms. We believe the company continues to have meaningful price and volume leverage in a copper constrained world.”12. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Ken Fisher's Stake: $2.21 billionKen Fisher upped his stake in Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) by 3% in the second quarter, ending the period with a $2.21 billion stake in the company.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 84 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL).

Revenues grew 17% and were primarily driven by Cloud Services (up 29%) with Oracle’s cloud infrastructure (OCI) business growing 89% in the quarter. Oracle has messaged that this business has price-performance advantages as compared to the other infrastructure companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) and appears to be winning business as a result. On the earnings call, management made the case that OCI will play a significant role in the Generative AI workloads which bodes well for continued growth.”11. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Ken Fisher's Stake: $2.4 billionAnother stock that is getting buoyed on the back of the AI boom, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is up about 51% year to date. Ken Fisher has been benefitting from this rally as he has a $2.4 billion stake in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 109 hedge funds out of the 910 tracked by Insider Monkey were long Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 99 funds in the previous quarter.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) to Buy from Neutral and also increased his price target to $630 from $575.The analyst noted that Adobe is ahead of the curve in AI and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is expected to see growth in fiscal 2024.Polen Global Growth Strategy made the following comment about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“While Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s growth has moderated from high teens to low teens during the past couple of years, Adobe continues to deliver solid growth, and management raised its full-year guidance during the most recent quarter. The company also introduced some AI product enhancements, which seem to have helped shift the narrative from “AI is going to be bad for Adobe” to “AI is going to be good.” Finally, the company continues to work towards the Figma acquisition.It’s still uncertain whether antitrust regulators will allow this acquisition to close. That said, the stock seems to have been recovering from the initial reaction that the pricey acquisition indicated something more troubling about Adobe’s growth and competitive position. Solid ongoing fundaments have helped dispel that notion. We think it would be a big positive if the acquisition closes, but we remain confident in Adobe’s business even if it doesn’t.”10. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Ken Fisher's Stake: $2.7 billionKen Fisher’s hedge fund owns about $2.7 billion worth of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) shares as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) recently posted weak Q2 results. Operating income in the period fell 6.6% to $6.59 billion.

Team Depot was created in 1993 as a way of organizing associates who were eager to volunteer in their communities. For 30 years, Team Depot associates have worked side by side with non-profits around the United States. Focus areas include spending time with the elderly and activities with at risk youth. Team Depot also improves the homes and lives of veterans and helps communities impacted by natural disasters.During the quarter, Home Depot set a goal for battery-powered products to represent over 85% of outdoor lawn equipment sales in the U.S. and Canada by the end of fiscal 2028. Push lawn mowers and handheld leaf blowers and trimmers will run on rechargeable battery technology instead of gas. This will reduce 2 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually.”9.

Ken Fisher’s hedge fund reported owning a $2.9 billion stake in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) at the end of the June quarter.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 122 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported owning stakes in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).Ithaka US Growth Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is the largest pure-play cloud software company, holding a leading market share in customer relationship management applications and a top-five market share position in the company’s other clouds (Marketing, Service, Platform, Analytics, Integration, and Commerce). The company’s software subscription term-license model differs from the traditional perpetual-license software model in two respects: (1) the software is hosted on centralized servers and delivered over the internet, as opposed to traditional enterprise software that is loaded directly onto customers’ hard drives or servers; and (2) the revenue model is subscription-based, typically charging monthly fees per user as opposed to charging one-time licensing fees. The stock’s strong relative performance followed a strong F4Q23 earnings release that easily beat Street expectations on the top- and bottom-lines. In addition to the beat, management announced a number of initiatives that activist investors have been clamoring for, specifically a halt to large M&amp;A transactions and a focus on operating profitability.”8.

We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi’s technological leadership; pricing power; and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, 5G, and IoT; will allow the company to sustain strong earnings growth over the next several years.”7. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Ken Fisher's Stake: $3 billionWhile Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shares have gained about 61% year to date, the stock has been under pressure over the past few days amid concerns that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) will remain the market leader in the chips industry amid the edge it has in the AI space.

(NASDAQ:AMD) as of the end of the second quarter of 2023.L1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“During the June 2023 quarter the AI bubble continued to inflate. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), as a key challenger to Nvidia, will benefit from increased demand for its next generation semiconductor chips. AMD’s share price is reflecting very bullish sentiment and the share price has run ahead of a reasonable base case valuation. Accordingly, we divested our entire position and moved AMD to our Bench.”6. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)Ken Fisher's Stake: $3.5 billionNetherlands-based semiconductor company ASML Holding N.V.

(NASDAQ:ASML) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) has no competitor. We’d characterise it as a monetary ‘apex’ predator. This privileged position allows the company to capture value within the semiconductor ecosystem. You can see it in their margins and operating leverage. ASML’s customers are so eager for their products that they are willing to pay upfront, two years before a machine is even delivered! This is a testament to the company’s unrivalled capabilities and the high demand for its unique offerings.

136,d1a9dc8b-4cdd-3ac6-9271-b924711d8c58,PEP,2023-08-28,"PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) Is About To Go Ex-Dividend, And It Pays A 2.8% Yield",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pepsico-inc-nasdaq-pep-ex-101449411.html,1693217689,STORY,['PEP'],"[Readers hoping to buy PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Thus, you can purchase PepsiCo's shares before the 31st of August in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 29th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.27 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$5.06 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that PepsiCo has a trailing yield of 2.8% on the current share price of $179.42. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for PepsiCo Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Its dividend payout ratio is 82% of profit, which means the company is paying out a majority of its earnings. The relatively limited profit reinvestment could slow the rate of future earnings growth. We'd be concerned if earnings began to decline. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Over the past year it paid out 111% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is uncomfortably high. It's hard to consistently pay out more cash than you generate without either borrowing or using company cash, so we'd wonder how the company justifies this payout level.Story continuesPepsiCo paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough cash to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were PepsiCo to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. For this reason, we're glad to see PepsiCo's earnings per share have risen 11% per annum over the last five years. Earnings have been growing at a decent rate, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. PepsiCo has delivered an average of 8.9% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpShould investors buy PepsiCo for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share growth is a positive, and the company's payout ratio looks normal. However, we note PepsiCo paid out a much higher percentage of its free cash flow, which makes us uncomfortable. Overall, it's not a bad combination, but we feel that there are likely more attractive dividend prospects out there.With that being said, if dividends aren't your biggest concern with PepsiCo, you should know about the other risks facing this business. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs for PepsiCo that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

138,f5933888-e137-3ef7-9fec-0a7c4ce867c6,UNP,2023-08-28,Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) Has Announced A Dividend Of $1.30,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacific-nyse-unp-announced-104003030.html,1693219203,STORY,['UNP'],"[Union Pacific Corporation's (NYSE:UNP) investors are due to receive a payment of $1.30 per share on 29th of September. This means the annual payment is 2.3% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific Union Pacific's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Union Pacific's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 27.8%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 41% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendUnion Pacific Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.38 total annually to $5.20. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 14% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To Come ByInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Over the past five years, it looks as though Union Pacific's EPS has declined at around 5.3% a year. If earnings continue declining, the company may have to make the difficult choice of reducing the dividend or even stopping it completely - the opposite of dividend growth. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.Our Thoughts On Union Pacific's DividendOverall, we think Union Pacific is a solid choice as a dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't raised this year. While the payments look sustainable for now, earnings have been shrinking so the dividend could come under pressure in the future. This looks like it could be a good dividend stock going forward, but we would note that the payout ratio has been at higher levels in the past so it could happen again.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. As an example, we've identified 1 warning sign for Union Pacific that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Now.The US stock markets are jumpy amid analyst firms downgrading banks and some analysts suggesting the economy is still not out the recession danger. Fitch recently warned that there’s a chance it might have to downgrade several US banks, including market leader JPMorgan. The news comes after Moody’s downgraded several banks. The industry has already seen the collapse of several regional banks earlier this year.While the US stock market rebounded earlier this year and latest inflation data pointed to cooling pricing pressures, some circles are seeing market optimism with skepticism. A Bloomberg report recently quoted Jonathan Millar, a senior economist at Barclays Capital Inc., who thinks that the picture will only be clear after at least two quarters. The analyst said that while inflation has come down, the Federal Reserve acknowledges the fact that the possibility of a soft landing “is far from assured.”Some analysts also believe that the real effects of the Federal Reserve’s incessant rate hikes are yet to be seen. A report or two showing signs of a slight decline in inflation would not be enough to label Fed’s action successful. In the past, whenever the Fed has slapped the economy with consistent rate hikes, the results were tough. A Bloomberg report quoted a study former Fed Vice Chair Alan Blinder, which studied and analyzed 11 monetary policy tightening from 1965 to 2022. Most of the studied hawkish steps caused “hard landings or a reacceleration in inflation two years later.” That means even if inflation comes down in the short term, there would always be a threat of it coming back. That’s why the Federal Reserve has been insisting to bring inflation down to 2%, but many analysts believe that target is too ambitious and might not be achieved even with more rate hikes without tipping the economy in recession.Story continuesIn this backdrop, it always makes sense to see which defensive stocks money managers and elite hedge funds are betting on. Defensive stocks are always relevant. They aren’t just for recessions or downturns. Having exposure to defensive plays ensures stable and reliable returns as many defensive companies are mature and market leaders with dividend payments and thriving business models.A 2012 research paper by AQR takes a look at detailed data-based evidence highlighting how low-risk, defensive stocks have outperformed volatile stocks over longer periods of time. The report says:Historically, risky securities have not generated higher risk- adjusted returns than safe securities within the same asset class. In other words, investors holding safe securities have received much higher compensation relative to the risk they bared. While academics initially referred to this effect as the “low-beta anomaly,” the evidence has been extended to include other risk measures beyond just beta: total volatility, idiosyncratic volatility as well as more fundamental measures of risk, generically referred to as “quality.”Best Defensive Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Kaleidico on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we first listed down all holdings of the Invesco Defensive Equity ETF (DEF).

Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75One of the biggest pharmaceutical companies, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a solid defensive play due to its pipeline and dividends. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) shares recently jumped after the company upped its full-year revenue guidance. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)’s Q2 revenue also remained upbeat amid growing sales of its cancer drug Keytruda and HPV vaccine, Gardasil.As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 75 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database were long Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). The biggest stakeholder of Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

(NYSE:MRK) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“During the second quarter, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) filed the first lawsuit (followed by the filing of additional lawsuits by other parties) against the federal government challenging the constitutionality of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program (the Program) that Congress established as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. In Merck’s complaint, Merck argues that the Program violates the Fifth Amendment because it allows the federal government to take Merck’s innovative drugs without providing just compensation for them. In addition, Merck argues the Program violates the First Amendment because it forces them to sign an agreement saying the government mandated prices are fair and the result of a negotiation when in fact, Merck argues, prices are not negotiated or fair. These lawsuits will take time to work their way through the legal process and in the meantime, the Program moves ahead on its scheduled path. The consensus view is that these lawsuits will not be successful, and the Program will remain in place. We suspect Merck’s arguments may convince at least a few U.S. Supreme Court Justices when the case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, but the ultimate outcome is impossible to predict. For now, we assume the Program will remain in place and invest with that framework in mind.”12. AbbVie Inc.

We exited our position during the quarter. We sold AbbVie Inc. due to our less optimistic view of the company’s pipeline and long-term growth profile.”11.

CVS has been moving its portfolio to a more value-based outcome model, and Aetna was a major move in that direction. We were willing to accept the leverage that came with the deal because CVS has a very cash generative model, and we anticipated the free cash flow would enable the company to de-lever fairly quickly.By mid-2022, CVS was in a position to use the free cash flow that had been going to debt repayment to do bolt-on deals to further prepare for the value-based outcome model and/or return more cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or share repurchases. However, CVS lost a “star” in its largest Medicare plan in late 2022 and this will adversely impact earnings in 2024. This was a surprise and disappointment to us, but management should be able to regain the “star” in the back half of 2023, which will then give the company a nice tailwind in 2025…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

Originally McGraw-Hill Financial, the company changed its name in 2016. The company’s operations consist of five segments: ratings, commodity insights, indices, market intelligence and mobility.We see S&amp;P Global’s diversified business model as primarily subscription-based, which generates a sizeable recurring revenue stream and helps it navigate various market or macroeconomic environments. The company has a significant competitive advantage that provides substantial barriers to entry and sustainable competitive supremacy. We believe that technologyfocused strategic investments made over the past few years should help accelerate organic growth over the next few years, as the company continuously seeks to improve its existing offerings while striving to meet ever-evolving client needs.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Now. Suggested articles:Goldman Sachs Dividend Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks15 Smallest Stocks In Warren Buffett’s PortfolioStanley Druckenmiller 13F Portfolio: Top 15 StocksDisclosure: None. 13 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
