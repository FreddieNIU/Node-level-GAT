While many semiconductor stocks performed well last year, especially ones connected to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), there were a number of semiconductor stocks to sell. The semiconductor sector is crowded, and nowadays, there are a number of geopolitical considerations to dwell on, as well as a global economic slowdown to think about.', 'In this article, we will go over three semiconductor stocks to sell.', 'Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com', 'Qualcomm\xa0(NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading wireless technology and semiconductors business.

Unfortunately, Qualcomm’s stock is likely to face long-term jeopardy as China’s burgeoning semiconductor industry shifts the balance of power in the sector. SMIC, China’s major contract chipmaker, expects to produce five nanometer chips in 2024 for Huawei devices, despite U.S. sanctions. Rising competition in China does not bode well for Qualcomm’s chips in the long run, especially when nationalism could play a role in Chinese companies turning to locally produced semiconductor devices.', 'Unless Qualcomm is able to make the right bets and investments on IoT and vehicle semiconductor devices, the company could face slowing growth in the coming years.', 'Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com', 'Texas Instruments\xa0(NASDAQ:TXN) primarily\xa0operates\xa0two business segments: Analog and Embedded Processing.

For this reason, analog devices are paired with “embedded devices” and are used to manage, manipulate and divert power in electronics.', 'Texas Instruments, unfortunately, has suffered\xa0uneven sales growth\xa0since the early 2000s. In some years, like in 2021 or 2017, the semiconductor giant reported double-digit sales growth, but in other years, growth was either sluggish or contracted entirely.', 'The unevenness continued in its most recent Q4 earnings report. Sales missed targets while earnings came in ahead. Management did not provide a rosy picture on guidance either, most likely due to what it sees as slowing growth in its automotive and industrial segment.

If you want to skip our overview of the medical and healthcare industry, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Medical Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds. ', ""The medical and healthcare industry is one of the biggest in the world. The medical industry is assured of a steady demand for its products and services simply due to the fact that human beings are biological creatures. This means that medical stocks such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and hospital stocks such as Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC) are some of the biggest in the world. It also means that these stocks have the potential to capitalize on trends that can suddenly appear due to crises such as the coronavirus pandemic. While the fast paced nature of news cycles in the 21st century means that public focus quickly changes focus, in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic's rapid spread in 2020, investors were fretting and would have given an arm and a leg to prod the crystal ball into telling them which medical stock would be the right bet when it came to navigating the global healthcare prices."", ""As time would tell, medical stocks like Pfizer and the Cambridge, Massachusetts based biotechnology company Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) were some of the hottest due to their vaccines. During the roughly year and a half between December 2019 and September 2021, Moderna's shares appreciated by a whopping 429% on the stock market -\xa0 a result that shows that even small bets made at just the right time can yield juicy profits for investors from all walks of life. Pfizer's stock gained a more modest 50% during the same time period; but the difference between these gains is one that is understandable since Pfizer's current market capitalization of $155 billion is more than four times of Moderna's."", 'Additionally, another key difference between Moderna and Pfizer also applies to the broader categories of medical stocks that include high growth sectors such as biotechnology and somewhat more stable ones like medical device manufacturers and hospital operators. Pfizer, like its peers Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), benefits from one of the classic principles of business management, a.k.a, diversification. These medical stocks have the luxury of sizeable balance sheets that allow them to participate in markets for simple medicines that can be produced at mass scale like blood thinners, as well as medical industry segments requiring massive capital expenditure and research capabilities such as biotechnology and genetic engineering.', ""However, with genetic engineering having entered the conversation, this particular area of medicine benefits from smaller companies that are able to laser focus on being able to change the very 'code' of the human body. At the same time, while the glitzy and glamorous nature of high technology areas such as artificial intelligence means that the bulk of public and media attention remains focused on them, recent months have also seen medical stocks involved in the genomics industry make strides. If you're interested, you can check out 12 Best Genomics Stocks To Buy Now for a detailed look at these stocks."", ""So what's big in genomics? Well, medical stocks Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) and BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:BBIO) scored big wins in December 2023 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first therapies for sickle cell disease that use gene therapy. According to Yale Medicine, Vertex's Casgevy essentially 'slices' a patient's DNA to improve odds of fighting sickle cell disease while BBIO's Lyfgenia introduces substances that improve blood health."", ""Yet, mega medical stocks Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) are also all the hype these days as their medications finally provide an off the shelf solution to lose weight. So much so that Eli Lilly's shares are up by a whopping 380% since 2020 while Novo Nordisk's stock has gained 275% over the same time period.

Here's what history shows."", ""Before we get to that history, let's first address why a stock split might provide a catalyst. The idea is that many retail investors are less likely to buy stocks with high share prices. Since splitting the stock lowers the share price, these investors could rush in to buy the stock at a lower price. This then creates buying pressure that pushes the share price up."", ""Does this theory work in the real world? Sometimes it does; sometimes it doesn't."", ""Walmart has conducted nine 2-for-1 stock splits through the years. The first one was on Aug. 25, 1975. There wasn't a big move in share prices before or immediately after the split. It was a different story with the company's next 2-for-1 stock split on Dec. 17, 1980, though. Walmart's shares had been sliding lower before the split but rebounded nicely after the split."", 'On July 12, 1982, Walmart conducted another stock split. Again, the split seemed to serve as a catalyst.', 'Almost exactly one year later, the discount retailer was at it again. Walmart conducted another 2-for-1 stock split on July 11, 1983. This time, there was a bump immediately after the split followed by a decline within a matter of days.', ""The next two splits for Walmart came in October 1985 and July 1987. Walmart's share price jumped after each split, with the one on July 13, 1987, followed by an especially strong gain."", ""However, this pattern wasn't always replicated. For example, it isn't clear that the stock split conducted on July 9, 1990, caused Walmart's shares to rise since an uptrend was already underway."", ""It's also hard to tell if Walmart's next stock split on Feb. 26, 1993, affected the stock's performance. Shares were already rising before the split and continued to do so for a few days afterward."", ""Walmart's most recent stock split occurred on April 20, 1999.

However, all of the gains soon evaporated."", 'WMT data by YCharts', ""I think there's one key lesson from Walmart's stock split history: There's no way to know what the stock will do after a split.

However, the company's e-commerce and advertising businesses stand out as two important growth drivers for the future."", ""My biggest concern with Walmart is its valuation. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 23.8x. That's not an absurdly high premium, but it's not cheap, either. I still like Walmart as a long-term pick.

If you want to skip our coverage of the latest stock market news, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Breakout Stocks To Buy Right Now.', ""The stock market in 2024 is more optimistic and forward looking than it was at the start of last year. Back then, investors were fretting about the state of the U.S. economy and the impact that high interest rates from the Federal Reserve would have on it. Yet, as 2023 demonstrated, and much to everyone's surprise, neither did the U.S. economy tip into recession and nor did the stock markets fall and wipe out wealth."", ""Instead, AI prevailed everywhere as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other big ticket technology names soared after OpenAI's ChatGPT convinced the world that A.I. now roams among us."", ""In fact, February 2024 is the first time in its history that the flagship S&P 500 index has crossed 5,000 points. As if this weren't enough, the month has also seen the NASDAQ Composite, dominated by the technology industry, near its all time high levels before paring back the breakout. At the heart of this stunning performance is, you guessed it, A.I. The start of the year has seen industry bigwigs the likes of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) chief Mr. Mark Zuckerberg, NVIDIA boss Jensen Huang, and of course, OpenAI's eccentric Sam Altman all take the stage and reaffirm their optimism for the artificial intelligence industry."", ""It was Zuckerberg who got the ball rolling, as he shared his firm's plans for buying hundreds of thousands of GPUs from NVIDIA this year in order to beef up Meta's computational capacity. Since we'll be talking about breakout stocks in this piece, Meta is particularly important as far as 2024 is concerned. This is because its shares have shown the classic trait of a sudden breakout in the wake of a catalyst. While the Meta chief's GPU comments were nevertheless welcome, the true surge in the firm's shares came after its earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2023. This report saw the firm report a surprise dividend of 50 cents. Since the earnings report, Meta's shares are up by 18%, making it a classical example of a breakout stock."", ""Yet, when we talk about breakout stocks in the A.I. era, the crown is still firmly placed on NVIDIA and Mr. Huang's head. NVIDIA's shares are already up by 49.9% year to date in a blistering set of results that saw NVIDIA briefly become more valuable than big ticket technology stocks Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)."", ""Similarly, another breakout stock that has soared recently is also related to artificial intelligence and also has a close relationship with NVIDIA. This stock is none other than the British semiconductor design house Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM). Arm is one of the youngest entrants on the stock market, and before its shares were publicly listed, NVIDIA was on its way to buy the firm before regulators marred the plans. Well, the decision to go public seems to have served Arm well, since it's a breakout stock that is now up by 145% since its IPO."", ""So why is Arm soaring? Well, all the company had to do was to convince investors that there were A.I. related orders down in the pipeline, and off the shares went. Arm's latest earnings call saw plenty of AI mentions, with the management commenting:"", ""From the most complex devices on the planet for training and inference, the NVIDIA Grace Hopper 200 to edge devices such as the Gemini Nano Pixel 6 from Google or the Samsung Galaxy S24, more and more AI is running on more end devices, and that's all running on Arm. And what that has done is driven a very strong set of tailwinds for our licensing growth. When we look at demand for new products from a licensing standpoint, what we are finding from the end market is that we've reached nowhere near good enough relative to the capability of the technology, and end customers for new designs are needing more and more Arm technology to keep up, particularly with the AI demands."", 'Looking at these trends, it appears that the gods of the stock market are plenty favorable when it comes to breakout stocks.

It's an incredible follow-up to the Nasdaq's 43% gain in 2023 and the S&P 500's 24% gain."", ""With some market indices reaching new all-time highs seemingly every day and many stocks becoming more expensive, you may feel like you want to take your foot off the gas ... but you don't know how. Investors in that camp have come to the right place."", 'Here are five responsible moves you can make without overhauling your entire portfolio.', 'If you want to avoid buying stocks you think are overpriced, you can simply allocate new savings to safer stocks. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the S&P 500 is 27.3, but there are many value-oriented sectors of the market that still trade below the market average, like energy, materials, utilities, consumer staples, and financials.', 'The key to building a portfolio over time is just as much about regularly saving and adding new cash to your account as it is about picking the right stocks. Consistently saving takes the pressure off the need to sell a stock to buy a different one.', ""Of course, some investors may be in the asset distribution phase and are slowly withdrawing from their savings rather than building them up. In that case, this step won't apply, but there are still plenty of moves to make."", ""Over the last five years, technology is the only sector that has outperformed the S&P 500, with the communication (led by Meta Platforms and Alphabet) and consumer discretionary (led by Amazon and Tesla) sectors also performing well.The market is being driven higher by big tech. If you've been overly exposed to these sectors, you may be feeling particularly vulnerable to a market pullback. Companies aren't perfectly correlated to each other, but if Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) all sell off, chances are other big tech stocks -- like Adobe, Salesforce, and the major chip players -- will also sell off."", ""A common mistake is assuming a portfolio is diversified because it includes many different stocks when, in reality, weightings and allocation are far more important factors. A portfolio can hold 100 stocks, but if 75% of it is concentrated in just a handful of companies, then it's not as diversified as it may seem at first glance."", 'The counterargument is that you should always go with your highest conviction and best ideas. But now would be a good time to review your portfolio and ensure it achieves the level of diversification needed to suit your risk tolerance.', ""If you find that your portfolio is overly concentrated in a certain sector or theme, you may wonder which stocks you should consider selling. Valuation matters, but an even more important point is the investment thesis. If an investment thesis isn't broken or has gotten even stronger, holding a stock may be a good idea even if it has run up."", ""A good example is Microsoft. Microsoft is up 275% in the last five years and is now the most valuable company in the world. Such a scorching hot stock may seem like it's overbought and ripe for a sell-off. But there are good reasons why Microsoft is a fair value."", 'For starters, the investment thesis has gotten stronger. Microsoft is a higher-margin, faster-growing company today than it was just a few years ago. Its legacy business units are doing well, its cloud business continues to surge, and artificial intelligence is having a measurable effect across its business units.', ""Microsoft has a 36.8 P/E ratio, which seems high. But if Microsoft can grow earnings by 15% or more per year, the stock could begin to look inexpensive rather quickly. A 15% compound annual growth rate results in a doubling in five years. So it wouldn't take a lot for Microsoft to double its earnings five years from now. I think Microsoft will average a growth rate even higher than that, which is why its current valuation is reasonable."", 'You may not want to sell a stock just because it has gone up, especially if the investment thesis justifies the price appreciation.', 'Nvidia was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2023. It is up a staggering 49.2% so far this year, making it the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 again in 2024 so far.', ""Nvidia is a phenomenal business that has a clear runway for several years to come, if not decades. But it has become a story stock. A story stock's valuation is based on what the company could do years from now, not what it is likely to do over the short term or even the medium term. In other words, optimistic investors continue to buy up a stock because they are projecting incredible growth without discounting the uncertainty that the growth will be lower than expected."", 'There are plenty of cases of story stocks living up to the hype, but then underperforming the market because so much growth was already baked into the price. Just look at Tesla, which is down around 50% from its all-time closing high of $409.97 a share on Nov. 4, 2021. Tesla as a company has grown a lot over the last few years, but the stock was priced to perfection.', ""The more Nvidia stock goes up, the more it will have to deliver blowout results quarter after quarter. At a certain point, it becomes unsustainable. An industrywide downturn, competition, or any unknown could throw a wrench in the growth rate and make the stock overvalued. It's unclear whether Nvidia is overvalued just yet. But it's the kind of company that could be worth trimming if you had, say, 5% of your portfolio in the company and now it has grown to 25%."", 'The absolute worst thing an investor can do is think the market has peaked and sell their entire portfolio (or close to it). History shows that every dip in the market turned out to be a worthwhile buying opportunity. The stock market may not have a blowout performance for the rest of the year and may even sell off. But making all-or-nothing decisions in the stock market is a great way to lose your shirt.', ""We're all human, so there's a psychological element to investing that's worth monitoring. The best way to invest is by building positions over time, rather than trading in and out of stocks or sectors. The ideas discussed here may lead you to make a few portfolio moves, but they shouldn't result in a complete portfolio makeover."", ""High-quality, expensive stocks tend to grow into their valuations over time. If you're a long-term investor, the objective should be to stay involved in the stock market, not jump in and out when things look frothy. If you're fighting the urge to sell everything, you may want to review your reasons for investing and ensure they align with your financial goals."", ""If you've been investing long enough, chances are you've been through the roller coaster of emotions that come with market volatility. You'll never make perfect decisions, but you can put yourself in a position to stay level-headed by going through healthy portfolio moves that are measured and not over the top."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

When he was just 24 years old, he founded Tiger Global Management with starting capital from his former boss and mentor, the iconic hedge fund manager Julian Robertson, Jr."", ""Coleman parlayed this seed money of $25 million into one of the world's most successful hedge fund empires, with roughly $58 billion in assets under management. He's currently ranked as the world's 500th richest person by Forbes with a net worth estimated at $5.7 billion."", 'Coleman is best known for spotting big winners early on, making notable investments in (among others) Spotify; Facebook, now Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META); and LinkedIn, now owned by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT).', ""He's no stranger to bold bets, so it isn't surprising that to close out 2023, Coleman had a whopping 45.8% of Tiger Global Management's equity portfolio invested in just five artificial intelligence (AI) stocks:"", 'Meta Platforms: 18.8%', 'Microsoft: 14.3%', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): 5.3%', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG): 4%', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): 3.4%', ""Let's look at Coleman's top holdings to see why he's so heavily weighted in these AI stocks."", ""Meta Platforms is Coleman's largest holding by far, which isn't surprising since he discovered the company when it was still Facebook."", ""When it comes to AI, Meta has a long track record of using sophisticated algorithms to its advantage. The lion's share of its revenue is generated by digital advertising, and using AI helps surface more relevant ads and appropriate content for its social media users."", ""With the ongoing recovery in ad spending, 2023 was a banner year for the world's second-largest digital advertiser. Meta helped fuel its growth by providing advertisers with a suite of AI-powered tools to help improve their results."", 'The company also jumped feet first into generative AI by developing a top-shelf AI model -- the LLaMA (large language model Meta AI) -- which is available on all the major cloud platforms, giving Meta an entirely new revenue stream. The social media company also announced its first-ever dividend.', ""Meta stock sells for about 23 times forward earnings, a discount compared to the broader market -- which likely factored into Coleman's investing decision."", 'Microsoft stunned tech aficionados last year when it invested $13 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, focusing the limelight on the potential applications for generative AI. Many big tech companies followed suit, and the AI arms race was on.', 'Microsoft made the most of its investment, quickly integrating AI functionality across a broad cross-section of its most popular productivity tools. It further bolstered demand by offering the most sought-after AI models on its Azure Cloud.', ""One of the biggest opportunities, however, rests in its suite of AI-fueled assistants: Microsoft Copilot. The ability of these tools to increase users' productivity has resulted in strong demand, which could generate incremental revenue of $100 billion by 2027, according to the I/O Fund's Beth Kindig. Azure's growth outpaced the competition in the fourth quarter, and Microsoft noted that 6 percentage points of that growth came from increased demand for AI services."", ""Microsoft currently trades for 35 times forward earnings.

And while there are certain comparisons being made to the dot-com bubble of the mid- to late 1990s, remember that that bubble lasted five years before bursting.', 'The debut of ChatGPT was just a little over one year ago, so there could be more room to run. And many AI-related stocks today are actually posting strong bottom-line earnings growth, unlike the profitless pretenders of the dot-com era.', ""Therefore, it's quite possible this tech bull market may have stronger legs beyond 2024. On that note, the following three stocks still seem like quite good buys as they continue to ride the AI wave."", ""There has been some hysteria over the potential threat of artificial intelligence on Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and its core Google Search business. On Thursday, Alphabet's stock fell on news that OpenAI was rumored to be working on a search product, according to tech magazine The Information."", ""While there is certainly the potential of a threat, it doesn't appear to justify Alphabet's lagging behind many other Magnificent 7 stocks over the past year -- especially since on the same day Alphabet announced the availability of Gemini 1.5, its newest and most powerful large language model (LLM), which Alphabet believes will be a tough rival to OpenAI's ChatGPT."", 'According to a Google blog, Google\'s AI unit has managed to increase the number of ""tokens"" Gemini 1.5 uses to over 1 million. According to Google, tokens are, ""entire parts or subsections of words, images, videos, audio or code,"" that make up the building blocks of an AI\'s processing capabilities. That million tokens is far higher than the mere 32,000 tokens in Gemini 1.0, and the 128,000 for ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Moreover, in a research setting, Google also has run up to 10 million tokens on Gemini 1.5.', ""The larger point is that just because OpenAI was first to market with an AI chatbot doesn't mean it will take the whole market. After all, one year ago, many thought Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Bing powered by ChatGPT, would take lots of market share away from Google search. But one year later, Google hasn't really lost any search market share to speak of, according to research firm Statcounter."", 'Meanwhile, Google search is an incredibly well-known brand that most consumers go to first. In fact, ""Google"" has become synonymous with ""search."" Therefore, as long as Google can keep up competitively with AI technology to a reasonable extent, as it appears to be doing, the search franchise looks pretty safe.', ""Even though KLA Corporation (NASDAQ: KLAC) is up about 11% this year, the stock has trailed several other AI names. That's strange, as KLA's inspection and metrology tools are used to identify defects in the highly difficult and painstaking semiconductor manufacturing process. And the more complex chips become, the more transistors need to be inspected. That should lead to an increase in equipment intensity and thus more sales for KLA."", 'Yet KLA stock fell initially after its January 25 earnings report, in which it forecast a soft second quarter.', ""However, the short-termism of Wall Street is likely to blame for that, and the stock has retraced all of those losses since. Delving into the conference call with analysts, the soft second quarter was due to a push-out of one large chipmaking project to later in the year. But that revenue will eventually be realized, as the project isn't canceled."", ""Like almost all semicaps, KLA saw its revenue decline in 2023, a result of the severe post-pandemic hangover in PCs and smartphones, as well as the Chinese recession. But if you believe in the current AI-fueled up-cycle, KLA's earnings should grow in 2024 and beyond into 2025."", ""Another interesting tidbit. KLA has a two-year warranty period for its machines, after which those machines go under KLA's service contracts and begin to bring in recurring-like service revenue, which made up 23% of revenue last year. So as the large amount of equipment sold in 2020 and 2021 come off their warranties, KLA should see an acceleration in service revenue."", ""KLA's services business grew 7% in calendar 2023 despite the downturn, but this all-important segment should reaccelerate to 12% to 14% average annual growth, according to management."", ""While KLA's P/E ratio looks high at 33 today, remember these are bottom-of-the-cycle trailing earnings numbers. With growth likely in 2024 and 2025, it's a buy today."", 'Not unlike KLA, photomask manufacturer Photronics is another undervalued way to play the growth of semiconductors.', 'A photomask is a photographic quartz or glass plate onto which a semiconductor design is printed by lithography equipment. Photronics then takes that pattern and manufactures a master mask through which light passes, which then prints the image onto a semiconductor wafer.', ""Photronics' business is more dependent on the growth of different semiconductor designs, and not really the total number of chips produced. That's why the company has actually been a steady grower over the past half-decade, even though the chip industry has experienced severe ups and downs over that time. In fact, Photronics just wrapped up a year in which it grew 8%. That's in contrast with a most of the semiconductor equipment industry that experienced declines last year."", ""In fact, 2023 was Photronics' sixth straight year of revenue growth, which is somewhat remarkable for this industry. Over that time, the company has compounded revenue at a 12% annualized rate. Even better? Over that time, the company's operating margin exploded from around 8% to roughly 30% currently. That's led to earnings per share increasing seven times over in just six years. Clearly, management has executed for customers, while holding off competition."", ""But it doesn't look too late to buy. Photronics trades at just 15.5 times earnings. And with more and more chip companies diversifying into more customized chip designs for more applications, including AI, that increases the number of chip designs coming just about every year. That bodes well for Photronics, which looks like an under-the-radar play on semiconductor growth."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

Not many people are sitting on thousands of dollars to buy shares."", 'That puts the company on watch for a possible stock split.', 'Companies splitting their stock is a common practice that can benefit investors and employees. But investors must know about some important rules for stock splits.', 'Here is why Microsoft could split its stock and what you need to know if it happens.', ""Stock splits aren't just for fun; they do good things for investors and company employees. For investors, a high share price makes accumulating full shares harder. Many companies issue stock to employees as part of their compensation. A high share price can make it harder for employees to control how they liquidate their stock."", 'Splitting the stock lowers the share price, lessening this problem for buyers and sellers alike.', ""Microsoft has split its stock many times before, but all of its splits happened many years ago. The stock split nine times from the late 1980s to the early 2000s but hasn't split once since then. As you can see below, the share price has now appreciated many times over:"", ""The company launched Azure and the cloud computing age in 2010, and 2023 potentially marks the beginning of Microsoft's next golden age, artificial intelligence (AI). A split would help investors and employees position themselves for what seems like a very bright future."", ""Investors' biggest mistake with stock splits is associating a lower share price with a cheaper valuation. Remember that price and valuation aren't the same. In other words, investors are paying a certain amount for a piece of the underlying company's profits. Splitting the stock cuts the company into more pieces but those pieces each represent less of the company's profits."", ""Analysts believe Microsoft will earn $11.60 per share this fiscal year, which, for Microsoft, ends in June. Suppose Microsoft announces a 10-for-1 split, meaning that one share of stock will turn into 10 smaller shares. For a $400 stock, that's 10 shares priced at $40 each. Microsoft's profits would also be split 10 ways, meaning earnings per share would be $1.16."", ""The stock's P/E ratio would remain the same because $400 divided by $11.16 and $40 divided by $1.16 get the same answer: 34.5."", ""You shouldn't buy a stock based on whether or not it splits, because it doesn't impact how much bang you're getting for your buck."", ""Instead, consider comparing Microsoft's valuation with what its growth might look like. Today, Microsoft's P/E ratio is roughly 35, and analysts expect the company's earnings to grow by an average of 15% annually over the long term. That's a PEG ratio of 2.3, which indicates Microsoft is a bit expensive for the growth you might get (a PEG ratio of 1 indicates a fair price)."", ""It's not a science; the company might grow faster than expected (or slower), and the narrative may be different in hindsight. A long-term horizon always helps because it gives Microsoft more time to grow into and beyond the stock's valuation."", ""Whether or not you buy Microsoft, make sure you're doing it based on fundamentals and not a possible stock split."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The list goes on, but you get the idea.\xa0I can almost guarantee that you used an Arm-based product today because 99% of all smartphones have CPUs built with Arm technology. Here\'s how it works.', ""Arm designs the specifications for chips that are energy-efficient, high-powered, and meet its customers' specifications for the end market.

Operating income was $338 million on an impressive 41% margin. Arm also has an enviable business model. Since it doesn't make the chips, its capital expenditures (equipment purchases) are very low, creating more free cash flow (FCF). Thirty cents of every revenue dollar went into the company's pocket last quarter."", ""What really excited investors last quarter probably wasn't the 14% increase in sales, though. It was the $2.4 billion remaining performance obligation, as shown below."", 'RPO is similar to a backlog. It represents contracts signed that will produce revenue in future quarters.

But does Google's new ChatGPT-beating AI app make the stock a no-brainer buy now?"", ""Some might have been tempted to write Google off as an AI contender early last year. ChatGPT was sizzling hot. Google's chief rival, Microsoft, was integrating OpenAI's AI model throughout its product line.

Here's why."", ""The way that businesses make money matters. There's not much point in buying shares of an operation that's selling off its productive assets to keep the lights on, because in the future, especially in the long term, it probably won't be able to generate as much revenue or earnings as it did in the past."", ""Walgreens isn't quite at the point of scrapping its core capabilities for short-term relief from its financial problems, but it seems to be getting closer over time."", 'With the company selling off $992 million worth of its stake in Cencora on Feb. 7, following another sale of $674 million late last year, investors would do well to pay careful attention to what exactly is going on and why. This move, along with a third $1.6 billion sale of Cencora shares in August of 2023, belies deeper issues that signal caution rather than opportunity.', ""Management says that the proceeds from the sale of these investments will go toward paying down some of the company's staggering debt load of $34.7 billion. Liquidating marketable securities is a temporary way to offset the fact that its trailing-12-month operating income is deep in the red, with losses of more than $1 billion. Worse yet, in its fiscal first quarter, investors just saw their quarterly dividend fall by nearly half."", ""It's clear that money is tight for Walgreens right now, and relief might not be in sight despite ongoing efforts to realize cost savings and reduce capital expenditures. Its new healthcare segment, which aims to provide primary-care services from its pharmacies, is anticipated to deliver adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of up to $50 million this fiscal year -- or as low as losses of as much as $50 million."", ""The fact that management isn't able to give shareholders a real clue about whether the segment will be reporting positive adjusted EBITDA or not isn't a good sign -- such accounting-adjusted figures are almost always more favorable to companies than non-adjusted ones."", 'The point of Walgreens spinning up a new healthcare segment, which competes with CVS Health, is to shore up its slow pace of top-line growth over the last five years.', 'The catch is that entering new lines of business typically causes profit margins to compress as companies spend on establishing market share, which is what Walgreens is in the process of doing right now. And with growth still slow, and financial flexibility increasingly constrained, the situation will likely take at least another year or so to sort itself out, assuming it does.', ""So the near-term setup is bearish, to say the least. Still, Walgreens has plenty of assets to sell off, including long-term equity investments like the stocks it sold recently. The market hasn't reacted with extreme negativity to news of its sales, at least not yet. It's feasible that within the next two years, it will return to consistent profitability and hopefully start marking some slightly faster revenue growth."", 'Until then, keep an eye on its operating margin.

Starbucks is forecasting slower growth for the rest of the year, even lower than what analysts predicted. And Yum Brands, parent company of Taco Bell, also reported a hit to fourth-quarter sales.', 'What do these companies have in common? Besides the obvious—they’re fast-food proprietors—these groups and others have been targeted for their perceived support for Israel’s military campaign in Gaza—and each company cited those protests as a material hit to earnings last quarter.', 'Since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, anti-war activists around the world have called for an end to the conflict while pressuring companies that they claim have supported Israel or suppressed pro-Palestinian speech on social media. The war, incited by an Oct. 7 Hamas attack that killed 1,200 and took hundreds of hostages, has escalated into a wider campaign in Gaza that has killed 28,000 people, including 12,000 children, and drawn criticism from the United Nations’ International Court of Justice, among others. President Joe Biden, widely criticized for supporting Israel, has lately called Israel\'s response ""over the top,"" which he followed by calling for a temporary cease-fire.', 'Burgers aren’t supposed to be political, though. Tell that to McDonald’s, whose Q4 earnings report revealed that sales in its international licensed markets and corporate sector, including the Middle East, shrank to 0.7% growth, compared to 16.5% the prior year, “reflecting the impact of the war in the Middle East.”', 'In a letter posted to LinkedIn, McDonald’s president and CEO Chris Kempczinski recognized that several markets in the Middle East “and some outside the region are experiencing a meaningful business impact due to the war,” and that “associated misinformation,” is affecting brands like his.', 'In October, photos of a McDonald’s franchise in Israel donating thousands of free meals to soldiers went viral, which ignited calls to boycott the chain. This moment also marked a period of declining sales in McDonald’s Middle Eastern and Muslim-majority markets like Indonesia and Malaysia.', 'Under McDonald’s franchise model, individual restaurants are not strictly controlled by the parent chain and often decide things like business location, pricing, advertisements, products, hiring, and even holidays it wants to observe. The perks of this model means the parent company can have bigger access to capital, open multiple locations, and increase brand awareness with minimal supervision of the franchisee. (Ray Kroc, the man who wrested control of McDonald’s from the McDonald brothers, famously said that it was secretly a real-estate company as a result of this franchise model, a story told in the ironically titled movie, “The Founder.”)', 'The downsides of the franchise model, as the company may be seeing now, includes loss of complete brand control and increased potential for legal disputes since franchisees have a lot of control over their operations.', 'Ajai Gaur, a professor of management and global business at Rutgers, explained how a parent company “doesn’t have much control” over its franchises, which can also “engage in social movements like charity.”', '“Even if the head office could do something, what would they do?” Gaur said, arguing that more transparency could help companies avoid attacks long-term. A parent company could show, for example, “whatever number of franchisees it has in Saudi Arabia, how many local people are employed there, what the business, profit, employment, and benefits are for the local community—and what the costs of the boycotts are.”', 'Beyond that, he said, companies often change their presence in foreign markets during times of war–two weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, McDonald’s, Coke, Starbucks and Netflix suspended operations in Russia. Within a very short period, “a lot of firms just sort of gave up everything there, and that obviously has financial consequences, he said.', 'Customers don’t expect them to stay neutral, either. “Society is becoming very sensitive to what organizations do,” Gaur said, “and they expect organizations to go beyond profit-making machines.”', '“If you don’t build your own narrative, someone else will build the narrative for you,” Gaur said.', 'Meanwhile, Yum Brands came under fire for its investment in Israeli startups, like TicTuk, an Israeli company that allows customers to order food on social networks and message apps. On an earnings call with investors last week, the brand’s CEO David Gibbs said “top line sales were impacted by the conflict in the Middle East region, with varying degrees of impact across markets in the Middle East, Malaysia, and Indonesia.”', 'For Starbucks, which has also been a target of antiwar activists, sales also fell short of analysts’ expectations, as revealed by its first-quarter report released last month. On the earnings call, Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said the company saw “negative impact to our business in the Middle East” and that “events in the Middle East also had an impact in the US, driven by misperceptions about our position.” Rachel Ruggeri, Starbucks’ executive vice president, added she expects the conflicts will contribute to lower earnings in the second quarter of the year.', 'Calls to boycott Starbucks came after the company sued Workers United, the union that represents some of its employees, for trademark infringement after the union made a social-media post stating, “Solidarity with Palestine!” on X. The company demanded the union group stop using its name and similar logo. According to the Associated Press, the workers put up the tweet without authorization of union leaders and it was removed after about 40 minutes. The union group responded with its own lawsuit and seeks to continue using Starbucks’ name and logo.', 'Matthew Goodman, a senior economic analyst at M Science, told Fortune that tracking the effect of a boycott is “very hard,” especially because other challenges, like shifts in consumer spending, price hikes, unions, and a shaky performance of its seasonal drinks, also affects its earnings. Still, companies need to be “more proactive than ever in monitoring and managing their reputations to minimize the risk that unflattering information, whether accurate or not, leads to consumer boycotts,” he said.', 'Last December, Starbucks’ stock fell by nearly 10%, a loss in value of nearly $12 billion, due to worker strikes and low foot traffic from customers.', 'David Denoon, a professor that studies politics and economics at New York University, told Fortune that boycotts are “an increasingly effective tool of economic pressure” because of social media, which allows organizers “to contact millions of people whom they might not otherwise have known.""', 'On TikTok, hashtags for boycotts have gotten more than 300 million views and shares, and other brands have been thrown into the fire, too. Retail clothing brand Zara became a boycott target after releasing a photo shoot in December that featured broken walls, rubble, and statues with missing limbs wrapped in white cloth, which activists called out as insensitive. The hashtag #boycottzara has more than 86 million views on the social platform.', 'Historically, boycotts have surprised companies by coming from all directions. Last year was rough for Bud Light, for instance, after the company’s social promotion with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney led to conservatives and celebrities boycotting the brand. The company said it lost about $395 million in North American revenue in the following months.', 'For 35 years, consumer boycotts were the heart of the campaign to end apartheid rule in South Africa, which ultimately ended in 1990. The boycotts, which largely did not touch fast food, in line with today’s patterns, ultimately caused British imports of South African textiles to fall by 35% between 1983 and 1986.', ""McDonald's, Starbucks and Yum Brands did not respond to requests for comment."", 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Any cafe that is renovated or opened in the future will begin implementing the company’s “Inclusive Spaces Framework,” it said in the release.', 'Customers frequenting new stores will notice softer indoor lighting that “minimizes glare, shadow patterns and backlighting,” making it easier for people to read menu items or key in-store information, according to Starbucks. The store design will also take acoustics into account by using materials that minimize background noise or echoes, which could disrupt people who use hearing aids.', 'In recent years, a number of retailers have begun considering the shopping experiences of customers with different needs. This awareness was heightened, in part, by the COVID-19 pandemic. Confronted with social distancing guidelines, some retailers carved out specific blocs — typically early in the morning — when immunocompromised, elderly and disabled customers could do their shopping in a less crowded environment.', '“The pandemic spurred a lot of retailers to think about more inclusive retail spaces,” said Maria Town, president and CEO of the American Association of People with Disabilities. “The growth of grocery delivery and pickup is also an element of inclusive retail, and I think more retailers have invested in these types of programs since the pandemic.”', 'More recently, some businesses have instated protocols and features that help reduce overstimulation and sensory overload. In November, Walmart began implementing “sensory-friendly” store hours between 8 and 10 in the morning, when in-store TV walls would feature a static image, music was turned off and store lights were dimmed. The retailer said these changes were an attempt to be more inclusive of customers and employees with sensory disabilities, including neurodiverse individuals.', 'In addition to paying attention to ambience, Starbucks said new stores will cut back on the front-of-house clutter with a new “continuous, unobstructed pedestrian path” that makes it easier for customers in wheelchairs or motorized scooters to get around the stores.', 'Counters where coffee and food is placed for pick-up will also be lowered to “accommodate wheelchair access and support better communication” between workers and customers, the company said.', 'Other changes include a new register that has a portable, adjustable stand, pictures of food and drink items, as well as voice assistance and screen magnification features.', 'According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in four American adults has a disability, a term encompassing a wide spectrum of physical and mental experiences. Although the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act codified nondiscrimination requirements for public-facing businesses in order to protect customers with disabilities, Town says non-compliance remains a pervasive issue in retail spaces.', '“For retailers, basic compliance with ADA continues to be a struggle. Whether that’s wide enough pathways or actually making sure bathrooms are accessible and that disabled patrons can check out independently,” said Town. “There have been times where I have been shopping and I could not physically reach the card reader.”', 'Starbucks said its inclusivity framework will be “open sourced and further developed to help expand accessibility across the retail industry.” On its site, the company has a “Retail Checklist” available to download, which lays out a tiered plan for designing inclusive spaces “that elevates retail environments, beyond the ADA.”', '“Starbucks opening of their new store built with inclusive design elements is a big moment as we try to make retail spaces more accessible and inclusive,” Tony Coelho, primary author and sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act, said in Starbucks’ release. “We have to go beyond just what is required to put accessibility and inclusion first to ensure all people feel like they belong in community spaces.”', 'The company has received criticism from disability rights activists in the past for eliminating plastic straws. But it reiterated its commitment to inclusivity this month, announcing a “goal to ensure that physical and digital Starbucks environments meet an elevated standard of accessibility by 2030.”', 'Starbucks added that it supports lawmaker efforts to expand and develop the ADA, such as eliminating a provision in the Act that allows employers to pay disabled workers less than minimum wage.', 'Town said it is encouraging to see Starbucks is looking at these issues in a systemic and policy-oriented way.', '“What I think is so fantastic about these efforts is that they highlight a commitment to policies that help us create a more inclusive economy,” she said. “Even if we create retail spaces and experiences that are inclusive, it becomes less meaningful if there’s still bias and disability exclusion baked into our policies that prevent people with disabilities from having things like a disposable income.”', 'Starbucks (SBUX) said last month in its earnings call that it wants to open 4% more stores in the United States, where it currently has more than 16,000. The chain last unveiled a new store design in 2019 with much of the similar aesthetic approach left intact with the new look.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

This includes different layouts, from small drive-thrus to larger layouts.', 'With the possibility of higher revenue comes greater scale. And the result could be expanding profitability, at least better than the third-quarter 2023 operating margin of 9%. Additionally, if Dutch Bros is able to reach its store target one day, it would certainly have a stronger brand presence. International expansion might also be in the cards.', ""The growth story sounds interesting, but Dutch Bros faces intense competition in the restaurant industry more broadly, and in the fast-food coffee space specifically. This forces me to question the company's durability. There are scaled rivals that currently have the upper hand."", 'Take Starbucks. It currently has almost 16,500 stores nationwide, making it nearly 20 times larger than Dutch Bros. Starbucks generated $6.6 billion in revenue just in the U.S. during its latest fiscal quarter (Q1 2024 ended Dec. 31). This means it has already established itself as the clear leader in the industry, with the financial resources to continue innovating its menu, marketing to new customers, and opening new locations.', ""Plus, Starbucks has one of the most recognizable brands on the planet. This supports its competitive position in a crowded industry. By comparison, I'd suspect that many households have still never heard of Dutch Bros.

This doesn't include the unlimited number of independent coffee shops that consumers might be inclined to frequent. And it doesn't include the ready-to-drink caffeinated beverages that can be found at grocery and convenience stores."", ""Competition might be something that investors overlook, but I view it as one of the most important factors to consider before buying a stock.

If you want to skip our overview of the medical and healthcare industry, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Medical Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds. ', ""The medical and healthcare industry is one of the biggest in the world. The medical industry is assured of a steady demand for its products and services simply due to the fact that human beings are biological creatures. This means that medical stocks such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and hospital stocks such as Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC) are some of the biggest in the world. It also means that these stocks have the potential to capitalize on trends that can suddenly appear due to crises such as the coronavirus pandemic. While the fast paced nature of news cycles in the 21st century means that public focus quickly changes focus, in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic's rapid spread in 2020, investors were fretting and would have given an arm and a leg to prod the crystal ball into telling them which medical stock would be the right bet when it came to navigating the global healthcare prices."", ""As time would tell, medical stocks like Pfizer and the Cambridge, Massachusetts based biotechnology company Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) were some of the hottest due to their vaccines. During the roughly year and a half between December 2019 and September 2021, Moderna's shares appreciated by a whopping 429% on the stock market -\xa0 a result that shows that even small bets made at just the right time can yield juicy profits for investors from all walks of life. Pfizer's stock gained a more modest 50% during the same time period; but the difference between these gains is one that is understandable since Pfizer's current market capitalization of $155 billion is more than four times of Moderna's."", 'Additionally, another key difference between Moderna and Pfizer also applies to the broader categories of medical stocks that include high growth sectors such as biotechnology and somewhat more stable ones like medical device manufacturers and hospital operators. Pfizer, like its peers Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), benefits from one of the classic principles of business management, a.k.a, diversification. These medical stocks have the luxury of sizeable balance sheets that allow them to participate in markets for simple medicines that can be produced at mass scale like blood thinners, as well as medical industry segments requiring massive capital expenditure and research capabilities such as biotechnology and genetic engineering.', ""However, with genetic engineering having entered the conversation, this particular area of medicine benefits from smaller companies that are able to laser focus on being able to change the very 'code' of the human body. At the same time, while the glitzy and glamorous nature of high technology areas such as artificial intelligence means that the bulk of public and media attention remains focused on them, recent months have also seen medical stocks involved in the genomics industry make strides. If you're interested, you can check out 12 Best Genomics Stocks To Buy Now for a detailed look at these stocks."", ""So what's big in genomics? Well, medical stocks Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) and BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:BBIO) scored big wins in December 2023 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first therapies for sickle cell disease that use gene therapy. According to Yale Medicine, Vertex's Casgevy essentially 'slices' a patient's DNA to improve odds of fighting sickle cell disease while BBIO's Lyfgenia introduces substances that improve blood health."", ""Yet, mega medical stocks Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) are also all the hype these days as their medications finally provide an off the shelf solution to lose weight. So much so that Eli Lilly's shares are up by a whopping 380% since 2020 while Novo Nordisk's stock has gained 275% over the same time period. Weight loss drugs are now a no longer a thing of the future, and investors have baked in their potential into medical stocks as well.

Among the myriad of choices, growth stocks stand out for their potential to outperform the market, especially for those looking to invest a set amount like $1,000. And right now, Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) stands out as a widely misunderstood growth stock that deserves your stock-hunting attention.', 'Roku has carved out a lucrative long-term niche for itself in the ever-expanding media streaming industry, which is becoming the cornerstone of modern media consumption.', ""The company has been in the game from the very beginning, starting life as the division of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) producing the first set-top boxes for video streaming. And it's still a market-defining, dominant leader in 2024. According to the data analysts at Pixalate, devices running Roku's streaming platform software accounted for 51% of the global connected TV (CTV) market in the third quarter of 2023."", ""After a few quarters of stalled growth, Roku is back in the business of collecting richer revenues again. With fourth-quarter sales rising 14% year over year to $984 million, with $176 million of free cash flow, Roku's financial health looks robust."", ""Furthermore, Roku never stopped grabbing new users, even during the darkest days of the inflation-scented crisis. The company added 10 million net new active user accounts over the last year, landing at a grand total of 80 million names. The platform's streaming hours also saw a 21% surge over the same span, indicating not just growth but increasing user engagement."", 'Looking ahead, Roku has set a promising tone, aiming to continue its revenue growth and improve free cash flows. The guidance suggests an upcoming focus on long-term profitability that could reassure investors. Recent moves in this direction include an aggressive cost-cutting program and very light price increases after riding out most of the inflation storm without reprinting any price tags.', 'The company is aware of the challenges posed by an unstable macro environment and a recovering ad market, yet it still anticipates sales to rise by roughly 20% year over year to approximately $850 million in 2024.', ""Despite these strong financial figures, Roku's stock closed 24% lower on Friday, following Thursday evening's earnings release. This counter-intuitive price drop reflects market volatility and investor sentiment, but also presents a potential under-the-radar investing opportunity."", ""The only serious reason to sell Roku shares right now would be to cash in some recent price gains -- the stock closed Thursday's trading session at a 132% gain from the end of 2022. But then you're missing out on what's ahead, and I think you'll soon be kicking yourself about selling Roku shares at this modest plateau."", ""For the long-term investor, Roku's strategy aligns well with industry trends. The shift toward digital media consumption is a wave Roku is well-positioned to ride. CEO Anthony Wood often reminds investors that all media viewing and advertising should eventually go digital, and Roku stands ready to capitalize on this fundamental sea change."", ""Last week's price drop is similar to Netflix shares taking a deep dive in 2011, when that company turned that streaming service into a real business and started letting go of the old DVD-mailer business. You may remember it as the Qwikster debacle, nearly 6,000% of market-crushing stock returns ago."", ""Except, of course, Netflix's price drop followed after an uncomfortable and potentially risky strategy shift. Roku's stock is just falling after a rock-solid earnings report with decent guidance. There is no radical new strategy on the table."", ""In my eyes, Roku's stock took a 24% haircut for no good reason. For investors with $1,000 to invest, such moments can represent a chance to buy into a strong company at a discount. If you're looking to invest any amount in a growth stock right now, Roku presents a compelling case."", ""With strong fundamentals, a clear growth trajectory, and a market position that suggests resilience and adaptability, Roku stands out as a growth stock that should deliver substantial returns over time. The road ahead may be bumpy, but there's nothing wrong with Roku's business. Due diligence is key, as with any investment, but Roku's recent performance and future prospects make it a worthy candidate for your investment portfolio."", 'I, for one, am planning to double down on my Roku investment as soon as I stop writing about it long enough.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

If you are not interested in reading about the landscape of expensive medical treatments, head straight to the 5 Most Expensive Medical Treatments/Procedures In The World.', ""In today's ever-evolving landscape of medical advancements, some treatments and procedures stand out for their efficacy and staggering cost. From groundbreaking gene therapies to intricate surgical interventions, healthcare offers an array of options for those seeking cutting-edge treatment. However, alongside these medical marvels comes a hefty price tag, sometimes reaching astronomical figures.\xa0"", 'The most expensive medical treatments and procedures globally encompass a range of interventions, including organ transplants, heart surgeries, and specific cancer treatments. These procedures incur significant costs due to surgical complexity, specialized equipment requirements, extensive post-operative care, and high medical personnel and technology expenses.\xa0\xa0', 'For instance, a kidney transplant may\xa0cost\xa0around $262,900, while a gastrointestinal transplant can exceed $1,206,000. A routine medical consultation with a general practitioner averages around\xa0$190\xa0in the United States, known for its costly healthcare system. The global medical treatment market is marked by substantial investments in research, advanced technology, and the expenses related to medical personnel and equipment. In 2021, the U.S. spent a staggering\xa0$4.1 trillion\xa0on healthcare, equivalent to 18% of its GDP.\xa0\xa0', 'Managing the high costs of medical treatments is a pressing concern globally, with countries grappling to balance healthcare expenses against the imperative of delivering quality care. Despite the financial challenges posed by expensive medical procedures, they play a pivotal role in addressing complex illnesses such as organ failure, heart diseases, and certain cancers, significantly enhancing patient outcomes and extending lives.\xa0\xa0', 'However, the exorbitant costs of these treatments present significant financial burdens for individuals and healthcare systems.\xa0Studies\xa0have consistently highlighted the financial strain imposed by expensive medical treatments. For instance, the average cost of a hospitalization for an appendectomy is approximately $33,000 in the U.S., compared to about €600 in France. Such disparities underscore the importance of comprehensive international health insurance to mitigate the financial impact of costly medical interventions.\xa0\xa0', 'In light of economic dynamics, McKinsey & Company forecasts a 4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the healthcare industry from 2021 to 2026, with anticipated profits reaching\xa0$790 billion. This projection marks a revision from an earlier forecast of 6%, attributed to inflationary pressures and labor shortages posing challenges to industry growth.\xa0\xa0', 'A 2021 report by the American Association of Medical Colleges predicts substantial shortages in surgical sectors by 2030, partly due to the prohibitive costs of medical education and student debt burdens. The anticipated profit increase is expected to stem from various factors, including changes in payer demographics, with the aging population favoring Medicare Advantage.\xa0\xa0', 'However, legislative shifts affecting eligibility criteria may lead to a decline in enrollment by approximately 10 million individuals over the next five years. Despite challenges, industry margins are forecasted to recover post-pandemic, with a projected CAGR of 15%. Additionally, ongoing costs associated with managing endemic COVID-19 are estimated to exceed $200 billion annually.\xa0', ""Pharmaceutical monopolies wield significant influence over the pricing of medical treatments, creating a complex marketplace characterized by competing interests and variable pricing structures. The industry's profitability is notable, with approximately\xa067%\xa0of drug companies experiencing an uptick in annual average profit margins from 2006 to 2015. This surge in profitability is a result of the industry's rapid growth, with global sales surpassing\xa0$1.2 trillion\xa0in 2020.\xa0"", 'The high profitability of the pharmaceutical sector correlates with increased investment in new drug development. Manufacturers are incentivized by larger markets and revenue streams, leading to expanded research and development efforts. However, concerns arise regarding the pricing of specific medical treatments, often attributed to market consolidation among drug companies. Such consolidation can diminish competition and contribute to inflated prices.\xa0', 'The demand for expensive medical treatments is multifaceted, influenced by shifting patterns in chronic disease prevalence, robust sales of new products, and the expansion of third-party drug coverage. Third-party coverage tends to bolster demand by offsetting the financial burden for patients, allowing manufacturers to justify higher prices and allocate more resources to drug development.\xa0', ""Among the most significant 25 drug companies, pharmaceutical and biotechnology revenues and profit margins witnessed growth between 2006 and 2015, underscoring the industry's resilience and profitability amid evolving market dynamics.\xa0"", 'In the dynamic landscape of pharmaceutical innovation and biotechnology, companies like Gilead Sciences, Inc.

Esophageal cancer treatment costs annually range from $30,000 to $200,000. The average\xa0price\xa0of esophageal surgeries is approximately $55,200, with some procedures reaching $113,756. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, depending on the cancer type and stage.\xa0\xa0', 'Treatment Cost: $46,763\xa0', ""Endovascular procedures on the skull, meninges, and brain are one of the most expensive medical treatments/procedures in the world, averaging $46,763 before insurance. They're used to treat complex issues like aneurysms and artery disorders. Due to their delicate nature, these surgeries require a specialized team of neurosurgeons, ENT surgeons, and radiologists. Factors like facility fees and device expenses influence the costs. These procedures are vital for treating conditions such as cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations, and can involve either minimally invasive endoscopic techniques or traditional open surgery.\xa0"", 'Treatment Cost: $47,114\xa0', 'The average retail price of a bowel-to-bowel fusion operation in the United States is $47,114. However, costs vary widely, ranging from less than $15,000 to nearly $69,000 at different hospitals. Without insurance, the procedure can cost between $30,000 and $120,000, influenced by hospital, location, and pre or post-surgery care. While bowel-to-bowel fusion can be a significant expense, it is not among the most expensive medical procedures in the world, which typically include heart and organ transplants costing hundreds of thousands to over a million dollars.\xa0', 'Average Treatment Cost: $66,935\xa0', 'A craniotomy is a complex surgical procedure involving the removal of part of the skull to access the brain, typically performed to treat conditions such as brain tumors, aneurysms, and traumatic brain injuries. It ranks among the\xa0most expensive medical procedures globally\xa0due to substantial associated costs, including hospital charges, surgeon fees, anesthesia, and post-operative care. The average cost before insurance is around $66,935, but prices can vary widely based on factors like the type of procedure and location of the medical facility. ', 'Single-use instrument costs for craniotomies also contribute significantly to expenses. A\xa0study\xa0emphasizes the need for cost awareness and efficient allocation of resources to manage overall costs. For commercially insured neurosurgical patients, mean out-of-pocket spending exceeded $1400 in 2016, with an average annual growth rate of 13%. Treatment costs for brain cancer, often involving craniotomy, can range from $30,000 to\xa0$100,000,\xa0adding to the financial burden for patients and families.\xa0', 'Average Treatment Cost: $102,399\xa0', 'Tracheostomy, a procedure creating a neck opening for a breathing tube, is one of the most expensive medical treatments/procedures in the world, with U.S. hospitals charging an average of $102,399. Studies\xa0show that managing a tracheostomy patient costs $192,184 Australian dollars. Timing impacts cost-effectiveness, with early tracheostomy potentially more cost-effective. Costs encompass hospital stay, multidisciplinary care, and complications. Factors like timing, technique (percutaneous vs. surgical), and hospital stay length affect total care costs. Percutaneous tracheostomy reduces procedure costs by avoiding operating room charges, but overall costs vary due to multiple factors.\xa0', 'Average Treatment Cost: $115,000\xa0', 'Spinal fusion is a significant and costly medical procedure used to address various spinal conditions. Its cost varies widely depending on factors such as location and specific circumstances. For instance, average prices for lumbar spinal fusion in the U.S. range from $86,182 in Denver to $48,169 in San Antonio. Costs vary by state, with estimates ranging based on historical cash prices. Regional variations show lower costs in the Midwest and higher costs in the Northeast. Direct costs for single-level lumbar fusions range from\xa0$8,286\xa0to $73,727. The significant cost differences underscore the need for transparency and understanding in healthcare pricing. Individuals should consult with healthcare providers and insurance plans for specific cost information.\xa0', 'Average Treatment Cost: $137,533\xa0', ""Exploratory chest surgery is among the most expensive medical procedures globally, with U.S. hospitals charging an average of $137,533 per procedure, making it the costliest single medical procedure in the country. It's often performed as emergency surgery following accidents or injuries to assess potential risks involving the heart and lungs. The high cost is attributed to its complexity, danger, need for specialized equipment, lengthy preparation, rehabilitation, and medications. The extensive resources required for pre-diagnostic surgeries and post-operative care also contribute to the overall expense. This surgery involves a thorough examination and potential interventions on vital organs, adding to its high cost.\xa0"", 'Average Treatment Cost: $170,000\xa0', 'Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is a significant and costly procedure for treating aortic valve disease. Costs vary widely, with average total charges of\xa0$18,923\xa0in Eastern China and reimbursements in the United States ranging from $32,000 to $94,000\xa0per case. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) devices alone can cost $32,500. Factors contributing to the high cost include surgery complexity, specialized personnel, advanced devices, and post-operative care. AVR can be performed through open-heart surgery or minimally invasive techniques, each with associated costs and risks. Indirect costs include hospital stay duration, post-operative care, and potential complications.\xa0\xa0', 'Average Treatment Cost: $275,000\xa0', 'A small bowel transplant is a highly complex and of the most expensive medical treatments/procedures in the world, with average costs ranging from approximately $275,000 to $1,147,300 in the United States, which includes pre-transplant evaluation, surgical procedures, post-transplant care, and lifelong immunosuppressive medications. Post-transplant costs for pediatric cases can amount\xa0to around $263,724, with an average hospital stay of 51.5 days. ', ""The high price is attributed to the procedure's complexity, the need for lifelong immunosuppression, and intensive post-transplant care. Despite the initial expense, small bowel transplants can be\xa0cost-effective\xa0and even cost-saving compared to long-term parenteral nutrition, mainly due to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs in the years following the transplant.\xa0"", 'Average Treatment Cost: $275,000\xa0', 'Intestinal transplants are costly, ranging from $275,000 to $1,147,300 per case in the US due to surgery complexity, post-transplant care, and immunosuppressive therapy.

Prior to this announcement, NOV's earnings easily covered the dividend, but free cash flows were negative. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 13.4%. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 7.0%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.', ""While the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.52 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.20. This works out to be a decline of approximately 9.1% per year over that time. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems."", ""With a relatively unstable dividend, and a poor history of shrinking dividends, it's even more important to see if EPS is growing. We are encouraged to see that NOV has grown earnings per share at 59% per year over the past five years.

Last year, it was Medical Properties Trust, a healthcare-focused real estate investment trust, while pharmacy chain giant Walgreens Boots Alliance started 2024 with a similar move.', 'These dividend cuts highlight the importance of finding stocks whose businesses are strong enough to support dividend increases even in challenging times. Fortunately, such stocks exist: Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Visa (NYSE: V) are three great examples.', ""As far as dividend track records go, it's hard to find many more impressive than Johnson & Johnson's. The company is on its 61st consecutive year of payout increases and the stock currently yields about 3%. That demonstrates a resilient and innovative business that can navigate challenging conditions, economic and otherwise, while constantly delivering strong financial results. And we can expect more of the same from Johnson & Johnson for many more years as the drugmaker's lineup features more than a dozen blockbusters."", 'Once those run out of patent exclusivity, J&J has a deep pipeline that will help it replace key medicines. The company also boasts a promising medtech division that develops products across several areas. Key growth opportunities here include its robotic-assisted surgery device, Ottava.', ""Johnson & Johnson isn't without risks. The company faces several challenges, including a relatively new law in the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act, that gave Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. The result could be lower sales for the companies that make these medicines, including Johnson & Johnson."", 'However, the drugmaker should be able to handle this issue by developing brand-new medicines that can escape this regulatory burden. Johnson & Johnson remains a top stock that will likely continue paying and raising its dividends for a long time.', ""Apple is best known for the iPhone, but the company's billion-dollar franchise is no longer a source of significant revenue growth. That shouldn't be too much of a problem, though; Apple is adapting its business and still has excellent growth prospects. The company has an installed base of more than 2.2 billion devices whose owners are eager to buy services."", ""Apple's services segment offers a suite of products from music and video streaming to health-related subscriptions. Apple's services don't yet account for most of its revenue, but they have grown faster in recent years."", ""The company's services segment also carries much juicier margins. The result will be stronger net profits, even if that might take awhile. The point is that Apple's business is solid and should continue performing well for a long time."", ""Not only does Apple have more than 2.2 billion people within its ecosystem, but the company's customers are incredibly loyal. Apple's brand name is one of the most valuable in the world and the tech giant's ecosystem is hard to leave unless consumers don't mind abandoning important features that don't carry over to other devices, or losing data."", ""What about the dividend? Apple has increased its payouts by about 104% in the past decade, and still boasts a low cash payout ratio of only 14%. Although the stock yields under 1% right now, the company can raise its dividends substantially without worries. And that's precisely what it's likely to do over the long run."", ""Everyone knows the Visa brand: The company helps facilitate credit card transactions through its payment network. There are millions of such transactions every day, and Visa collects a fee every single time. The company has few direct competitors, partly thanks to its network effect. At this point, any business that doesn't accept Visa as a payment method is practically begging customers to stay away."", ""And the more businesses are plugged into its network, the more consumers getting brand-new credit cards will be attracted to it. This dynamic has been going on for a while and is partly responsible for Visa's strong financial results. Despite millions of credit cards with its logo in circulation, Visa still has excellent growth prospects. The company will continue making money as long as card spending increases and people move away from cash and checks.."", ""That's been an ongoing trend for years, but there's plenty of runway ahead. Visa sees a significant opportunity to digitize cash and check transactions, even in advanced economies like the U.S. So it hasn't reached a ceiling yet -- far from it."", ""The company's dividend record over the past decade has been fantastic. Visa has increased its payouts by an incredible 420% while its cash payout ratio remains conservative at about 20%.

Here Are 2 Under-the-Radar Ways to Cash In on AI's Energy Needs.,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/43e36460-3968-3ae6-bc75-256eab288d1d/artificial-intelligence-could.html,1708255020,STORY,"['KMI', 'WMB']","[""Artificial intelligence (AI) is a multi-trillion-dollar megatrend. According to an estimate by PwC, AI has the potential to provide a $15.7 trillion boost to the global economy by the end of this decade. That's more than the current economic output of India and China combined. "", ""To reach its full potential, AI requires two crucial components: computing power and electricity. While most investors are currently focusing on the first aspect (e.g., semiconductors), many don't yet realize the importance of power. According to one estimate, data centers will grow from consuming 2% of the world's electricity to 10% by 2030. That's the equivalent of adding the electric generation capacity of the current U.S. power grid. While renewable energy will be crucial in powering AI, it can't carry that load alone. That drives the view that cleaner-burning natural gas will be vital in helping power AI's growth. Two under-the-radar ways to cash in on that trend are gas pipeline giants Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI) and Williams (NYSE: WMB). "", 'Electricity demand in the U.S. has grown slowly over the last decade. However, a reacceleration is coming:', 'As that slide shows, U.S. electricity demand will grow three times faster over the next two decades, powered by the electrification of the heating and transport sectors and growth from the power-hungry data center space (which are crucial to supporting AI applications).', 'Data centers are already heavy power consumers. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, they typically use 10 to 50 times more energy per floor space than a typical office building. Meanwhile, AI applications are even more power-intensive. For example, an AI-powered search query can use 10 times more power than a typical internet search. ', ""While most data center operators have pledged to use renewable energy to power their facilities, the power grid can't rely on renewable energy alone because of its intermittency issues. That's not a problem with natural gas:"", ""As that slide shows, utilities can count on natural gas to supply steady power. That's not something renewables can guarantee since the sun doesn't shine at night (or on cloudy days) while the wind isn't blowing consistently. While there are solutions to the intermittency problem (energy storage), they add to the cost. Thus, cheap, abundant, lower-carbon natural gas will play a vital role in supporting the growing electricity demand. Further, while natural gas does produce carbon emissions, the industry can utilize carbon capture and storage technology to reduce its carbon footprint. The energy industry can also use natural gas to produce lower-carbon fuels like blue hydrogen, which could power data centers."", 'Growing power demand should fuel the need for more natural gas power plants and related infrastructure to produce, process, and transport gas from production basins to end users. Current estimates suggest natural gas demand will grow by 19% in the U.S. through 2030, while global gas demand will increase by 15% by 2040. ', ""That bodes well for natural gas pipeline companies. They should see rising volumes across their existing infrastructure and new expansion opportunities. Kinder Morgan is the undisputed leader in gas infrastructure. The company operates the largest gas transmission network in the country. It has 70,000 miles of pipelines that transport 40% of the country's gas demand. It also operates 15% of the country's natural gas storage capacity. "", 'Kinder Morgan is in an excellent position to capitalize on future gas demand growth. It operates a nationwide pipeline network, with a stronghold in Texas and Louisiana, where gas production and demand are growing fastest (fueled by the Permian Basin on the production side and demand-driven exports). The company expects growing gas demand will increase its cash flow, giving it more fuel to raise its 6.8%-yielding dividend.', 'Williams also has extensive natural gas infrastructure. It has leading gathering and processing positions across top production basins. In addition, it owns the Transco pipeline, which transports gas to key market centers along the East Coast. It also controls 8% of the U.S. natural gas storage capacity. ', ""Williams is investing $2.7 billion to expand its Transco pipeline to capitalize on growing gas demand from utilities. It's also growing its gathering and processing positions to support rising gas production volumes across several basins. These expansion investments should give Williams the fuel to continue growing its 5.8%-yielding dividend. "", ""AI requires a lot of energy. That will add to the world's already growing demand for electricity as it pivots away from dirtier energy sources like coal and oil. While renewable energy will help supply a lot of this demand, it won't be able to do it all on its own, which should open the door for cleaner-burning natural gas to pick up the slack. Growing gas demand means more infrastructure like pipelines, which will benefit Kidner Morgan and Willaims. That makes them under-the-radar ways to cash in on the expected AI power surge."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Kinder Morgan right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Kinder Morgan, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Kinder Morgan wasn’t one of them.

Management has long-established medium-term guidance, and investors are inevitably penciling it into valuations and monitoring the key milestones to hit it. Here's a look at what it is and some thoughts about what it means to the investment proposition."", 'Management laid out its 2025/2026 targets at its investor day presentation in November 2022. The key parts of the plan involve a multiyear increase in airplane production, notably the 737 narrowbody, and a significant increase in Boeing defense, space, and security (BDS) profit margins, leading to $12 billion in segment operating cash flow. After $2 billion in capital spending is taken out, Boeing expects $10 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in the 2025/2026 timeframe.', 'Three things stand out to me related to these goals and where it stands today:', 'Boeing is falling behind on its milestones.', 'When, and not just if, matters in terms of meeting guidance.', ""The target is highly relevant for Boeing's long-term future, too."", ""Unfortunately, Boeing's progress toward its target isn't progressing as smoothly as hoped. Having outlined expectations for 400-450 Boeing 737 deliveries in 2023, leading to a production rate of 50 a month in 2025/2026, Boeing promptly missed its Boeing 737 delivery target for 2023 by only delivering 396 planes. Rather frustratingly, the key issues haven't been so much about supply chain difficulties and the unavailability of components. Instead, manufacturing quality issues have continued to hit Boeing, with the recent high-profile panel blowout on an Alaska Airlines flight the latest mishap."", ""As such, management decided to postpone its 2024 guidance on its recent earnings call -- not a good sign when investors are looking for a bridge to Boeing's medium-term guidance."", 'The other less-often discussed issue is that BDS continues to report losses. Boeing is not alone in suffering margin pressure in its defense business; RTX and Lockheed Martin are also feeling it. There appears to be particular pressure on defense contractors\' fixed-price development programs, which were won in less inflationary times. Back in October, Boeing CFO Brian West held out the prospect that BDS would contribute to Boeing getting to the $10 billion FCF target, but with a contribution ""maybe not quite as much"" as originally expected.', 'Speaking on the recent earnings call, West still remains ""confident"" in the 2025/2026 goals, ""although it may take longer in that window than originally anticipated, and we won\'t rush the system,"" he said.', ""While pushing the timeline for that $10 billion target further out might not seem to matter too much, it actually should make quite a difference to the way investors think about the stock. Looking at matters simplistically, it's reasonable to expect a mature industrial company to trade at 20 times its FCF. Slapping a 20 times FCF multiple onto Boeing and assuming it hits the $10 billion target gives you a target market cap of $200 billion, or $327 per share based on the current price."", ""That figure represents a 56% premium to the current price. For argument's sake, say the $10 billion is hit at the start of 2025, implying a stock return of about 56%. Now, say it's hit at the end of 2025; this implies a 25% annual return. Finally, assume the $10 billion target is hit at the end of 2026, implying a 16% annual return."", 'As you can see in this example, the timing makes a big difference to the investment proposition. For reference, Wall Street analysts expect Boeing to hit the $10 billion target sometime in 2026, as the consensus is for $8.8 billion in FCF in 2025, followed by $10.8 billion in 2026.', ""The Boeing 737 first flew in 1967, and while it's been updated several times (the 737 MAX is the latest generation), Boeing hasn't completely redesigned its narrowbody workhorse for decades. It takes time and, above all, billions in cash to develop a new airplane. Boeing CEO David Calhoun has articulated that there won't be a new Boeing plane in place before 2035."", 'However, Boeing will need to invest beforehand, and Boeing is holding $52.3 billion of consolidated debt. Simply put, Boeing needs the $10 billion in FCF sooner rather than later, not least to pay off debt and prepare for future investments.', 'The company will likely be in a better place in a few years than it is now. Still, the nuance of the timing of its FCF generation has a significant impact on the investment proposition and its longer-term future. The stock is attractive, but there are plenty of other aerospace stocks to buy that are executing better operationally. Right now, Boeing needs a few quarters of solid execution to dispel the doubters.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Boeing right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Boeing, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Boeing wasn’t one of them.

With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for Southern ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Southern from 14 analysts is for revenues of US$28.0b in 2024. If met, it would imply a notable 11% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to swell 10% to US$4.02. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$27.8b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.00 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates."", 'The analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$74.21, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Southern at US$82.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$65.00. This is a very narrow spread of estimates, implying either that Southern is an easy company to value, or - more likely - the analysts are relying heavily on some key assumptions.', ""Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. The analysts are definitely expecting Southern's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 11% annualised growth to the end of 2024 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 5.9% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 3.5% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Southern is expected to grow much faster than its industry."", ""The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have estimates - from multiple Southern analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Southern (1 is significant)  you should be aware of."", 'Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase Northrop Grumman's shares before the 23rd of February in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 13th of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.87 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$7.48 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Northrop Grumman has a trailing yield of 1.7% on the current share price of US$450.96. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Northrop Grumman can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow."", ' See our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman ', 'Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Northrop Grumman paid out 54% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Northrop Grumman generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Over the last year it paid out 53% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.', ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. With that in mind, we're discomforted by Northrop Grumman's 5.9% per annum decline in earnings in the past five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Northrop Grumman has lifted its dividend by approximately 13% a year on average. Growing the dividend payout ratio while earnings are declining can deliver nice returns for a while, but it's always worth checking for when the company can't increase the payout ratio any more - because then the music stops."", ""Has Northrop Grumman got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? It's never good to see earnings per share shrinking, but at least the dividend payout ratios appear reasonable. We're aware though that if earnings continue to decline, the dividend could be at risk. Overall it doesn't look like the most suitable dividend stock for a long-term buy and hold investor."", ""Having said that, if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend, you should still be familiar of the risks involved with Northrop Grumman.

It has dominated its industry because of how well the brand resonates with consumers, particularly versus competitors."", ""However, this single attribute could also be a reason for caution. Let's take a closer look at Nike and see why."", 'Over the past decade, Nike has been able to grow revenue and earnings thanks to its elevated standing among consumers.

Without a doubt, Nike's brand presence is the single most influential factor in its success. It's what encourages consumers to pay premium prices for what are largely commoditized products."", ""The biggest bear case for Nike investors, then, is the possibility that the brand's reputation diminishes for whatever reason. If the leadership team isn't a great steward of the brand, not taking the proper care in managing this intangible asset, sales could fall, and profitability could take a hit. And this would result in Nike's economic moat weakening."", 'Warren Buffett, who many consider the best investor ever, mentioned many years ago during a shareholder meeting why Berkshire Hathaway never purchased Nike shares.

This is during a time when budding rival Lululemon Athletica\xa0reported 19% revenue growth in its most recent fiscal quarter. Furthermore, major competitors in China recently posted double-digit top-line gains.', ""To be fair, the pandemic and ensuing supply chain issues made it difficult to properly manage inventory levels.

This isn't easy. And there could be times of heightened promotional activity and markdowns, which is what has happened recently."", ""But despite Nike's recent struggles, I think the business deserves the benefit of the doubt. It has been relevant for decades. Not only that, but it has maintained its industry leadership position in a market that must constantly navigate changes in consumer tastes and preferences.

The fintech stock has fallen 27% as investors lamented over lackluster growth and weak guidance, even as the S&P 500\xa0advanced 20% amid a resilient economy. But Wall Street thinks PayPal stock is oversold.', 'The median price target among analysts is $68 per share, implying 17% upside from its current price. But Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette is even more optimistic. His bull-case price target is set at $145 per share, implying 149% upside.', 'Investors should treat short-term forecasts with skepticism, especially when they come from individual analysts. But PayPal warrants a closer look given the Wall Street consensus.', 'PayPal reported good results for the fourth quarter, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 9% to $8 billion and non-GAAP (adjusted) net income rose 19% to $1.48 per diluted share. Strong bottom-line growth was supported by a 39-basis-point expansion in operating margin driven by cost-reduction efforts. CEO Alex Chriss says operating efficiency remains a top priority in 2024.', 'However, the stock dropped about 8% following the report as investors contemplated weak guidance. PayPal expects non-GAAP earnings per share to be flat this year despite plans to repurchase $5 billion in stock. That outlook is seemingly at odds with the push to control costs, and it relates to unbranded checkout being less profitable than branded checkout solutions.', 'Branded checkout involves the trademark yellow PayPal button, and unbranded checkout involves behind-the-scenes solutions like Braintree. PayPal earns lower margins on unbranded payments, and that part of its business has been growing much faster -- about 6 times faster in the fourth quarter -- than branded payments.', 'PayPal recently redesigned its branded checkout experience, making it simpler, faster, and more convenient. The company hopes those changes will boost growth in branded payments volume, but such an outcome is not reflected in guidance. That means the 2024 outlook leaves room for upside if branded growth accelerates more quickly than management expects.', 'The investment thesis for PayPal is simple. Most processors work with merchants only, but PayPal provides financial services to merchants and consumers. That affords the company a data advantage where consumer behavior is concerned. PayPal uses that information to prevent fraud and inform lending decisions, and its loss rates are among the lowest in the industry.', 'Additionally, PayPal has deep insight into how issuers make authorization decisions due to the sheer size of its network. It uses that information to improve authorization rates. Merchants find that combination compelling, so much so that PayPal is the most accepted digital wallet in North America and Europe.', 'More broadly, PayPal dominates the online payment processing market. Its 41% market share is nearly double that of the next-closest competitor, Stripe, which has a 21% market share. That means the company is a critical part of global e-commerce infrastructure and it should benefit as the industry continues to grow.', 'Straits Research expects retail e-commerce sales to increase by 8% annually through the end of the decade. PayPal should match that pace, provided it maintains its leadership in online payment processing, but it could grow more quickly if branded checkout volume accelerates or the company manages to boost Venmo monetization.', ""Regardless, bottom-line expansion should outpace top-line growth as the company continues to prioritize operating efficiency and repurchase stock. Indeed, Wall Street expects earnings per share to increase by 18% annually over the next five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 15 times earnings look cheap. In fact, that is essentially PayPal's least expensive earnings multiple at any point in history."", 'Shareholders should not expect triple-digit returns over the next year given the uncertainty surrounding the business, but investors with a five-year time horizon should consider buying a small position in this growth stock today.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Both are unusually high compared to long-term norms."", 'Not every ticker has followed suit, however. A handful of stocks are still more than reasonably priced.

Because it's a technology name, its business is in (digital payments), and its historic growth rate tended to be high, PayPal shares have been priced at a premium for most of their existence."", ""The COVID-19 pandemic, however, really rattled investors' way of thinking about -- and pricing -- this stock."", ""Oh, it didn't start that way. PayPal shares soared in 2020 and into 2021, with the bulk of the world's consumerism suddenly moving mostly online. It was a clear boon for the payment-tech business. But it was also a boon for all the other payment-technology companies fine-tuning their platforms and growing their reach even before the pandemic took hold. PayPal shares are down more than 80% from their 2021 high and still knocking on the door of multi-year lows as investors weigh the strength of this new competition."", 'But the sellers overshot their target.', ""That's not to suggest investors should simply dismiss alternative payment-tech names like Block or less direct competitors such as Adyen or even Amazon Pay. Those are threats, to be sure. However, since it's priced at less than 12 times its trailing and 12-month projected per-share earnings, the market's looking right past the fact that PayPal is still this industry's market leader while also ignoring that it's still growing its top and bottom lines. Indeed, the company handled 12% more payment volume in 2023 than it did in 2022, despite the world continuing to ease back into pre-pandemic, in-person consumerism mode."", 'Investors should recognize this reality in the foreseeable future.', ""It's been a tough past few years for Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC), and by extension, for Kraft Heinz shareholders. The stock has lost over 60% of its value since 2017, when it became clear that the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz wasn't working as well as hoped. The two organizations aren't more competitive when working as one, and cost-cutting linked to the pairing has arguably done more harm than good. Even Warren Buffett -- who largely orchestrated the deal -- concedes that the pairing of the two organizations was an expensive flop. What's done is done, though."", ""The thing is, time eventually heals almost all wounds. Kraft Heinz may finally be on the mend. Last year's sales were up, and perhaps more importantly, profits are up because the food giant is now spending money on the right things. Those things are marketing, technology, and research and development."", ""The market hasn't seemed to care yet, perhaps unimpressed by the company's lack of past and projected sales revenue growth. Take last quarter's revenue shortfall as an example. Analysts were calling for a top line of $7 billion, but the company only delivered $6.86 billion. Things are slightly more compelling on the earnings front, but only slightly. The company's fourth-quarter bottom line of $0.78 per share topped estimates of $0.77."", ""Look at the bigger picture, though. While things are slow-moving, CEO Miguel Patricio does seem to be steering this enormous boat in the right direction. The company is modeling a little more sales and profit-margin growth for this year despite the challenging environment, and analysts expect the same. Newcomers can not only jump into this revitalization while the stock's trading at a modest 12.5 times its trailing per-share profits, but also while the well-protected dividend yield stands at 4.4%."", ""This company isn't just cheese and ketchup, by the way. Kraft Heinz is also parent to familiar brands like Oscar Mayer, Ore-Ida, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Capri Sun, Maxwell House, and Jell-O, just to name a few. It's got something to sell to everyone."", ""Last but not least, add credit card outfit American Express (NYSE: AXP) to your list of no-brainer value stocks to buy if you've got $1,000 you know you won't be needing anytime soon."", ""While it's categorized as a credit card company, the classification doesn't quite do it justice. American Express is better described as an operator of a rewards-based payment network ... a good one. It's so good, in fact, that cardholders are willing to pay up to $695 per year just for access to perks like cash-back on grocery purchases, additional points toward future hotel stays, ride-hailing credits, and discounts on select streaming services. Mastercard and Visa card issuers certainly offer rewards and perks programs of their own. None of them hold a candle, however, to the depth and breadth of American Express's offerings."", ""This of course changes the dynamic of the company's business model. Whereas Visa and Mastercard simply keep a small piece of every transaction they process, a big chunk of American Express's top line comes in the form of fees. Generally speaking (and perhaps more importantly), this model also means American Express cardholders tend to be more affluent than average and therefore pose less credit risk to the card company itself."", ""That's why its write-offs remain relatively low, despite plenty of people increasingly feeling the burden of more expensive debt since 2022. This is also why last year's top line improved to the tune of 10% year over year, pushing per-share profits up from 2022's $9.85 to $11.21 in 2023."", ""This stock rallied of late, reflecting this resiliency. In fact, shares are up nearly 50% from October's low, soaring with the broad market's bullish tide.

The end of the mainframe computer era and the rise of cloud computing left the aging company behind. The revenue decline that began all the way back in 2012 was still well underway as of 2019. Many investors left it for dead.', 'What a difference five years makes! While IBM is still much smaller than it was then -- as measured by sales as well as profits -- the future looks promising. The organization has finally figured out how to remain relevant.', 'The question is, however, where will IBM and its stock be five years from now?', ""Younger investors may not believe it, but there was a time when IBM was the world's biggest company. And rightfully so. It just happened to be in the right place at the right time with the right technology -- the early days of personal computers."", ""As technology always does, however, it evolved. Mainframes and even desktop and laptop computers peaked, giving way to wireless internet, cloud computing, and mobile ways of connecting to networks. IBM just didn't keep up."", 'A funny thing happened five years ago, though. IBM acquired cloud computing tech specialist Red Hat, thrusting the company into the then-gelling arena. Then, in 2020, the company took another big leap into the world of cloud computing. It named Arvind Krishna as its CEO. Krishna made no bones about his vision either, penning a letter to all employees shortly after he took the helm, asking them to maintain a ""maniacal focus on our open hybrid cloud platform and AI capabilities.""', ""And by and large, IBM's employees have done exactly that. Last year's hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence software platform revenue grew 5%, with Red Hat's piece of this business growing 7% year over year in the fourth quarter alone; its hybrid infrastructure arm experienced revenue growth of 7% year over year in Q4. Overall revenue improved a little more than 2% in 2023 despite economic turbulence that prompted some would-be customers to tighten their purse strings."", ""That's not enormous growth, but it's progress following fiscal progress in 2022 as well as comparable progress in 2021. Better still, this progress is trickling down to the bottom line. Last year's operating cash flow of $13.9 billion is $3.5 billion better than the prior year's figure, while free cash flow grew by $1.9 billion in 2023 to $11.2 billion."", 'All of a sudden, IBM is interesting again. Ditto for the stock.', 'If you\'ve not taken a close look at IBM within the past five years, much has changed, including the business model itself. Although he didn\'t dive into the numerical details in January\'s fourth-quarter earnings call, IBM\'s CFO Jim Kavanaugh explained, ""When we deploy $1 [worth of spending on hardware], we\'re looking for a multiplier of hardware, software services on top of that."" In other words, the sale of one of its products drives the sale of other products and services.', 'Kavanaugh didn\'t offer updated specifics during Q4\'s conference call, but he has spoken about it before. Roughly a year ago, for instance, he noted that ""for every dollar of platform spend, clients spend $3 to $5 in software, and $6 to $8 in services."" Those numbers likely still apply today.', ""The company's results bear this idea out, too. Infrastructure is no longer its biggest profit center. IBM's consulting arm (services) is a bit bigger than hardware, and software is a much bigger business than consulting."", ""This matters -- maybe in a way few investors fully appreciate. Although profit margins on all of IBM's goods and services are strong, margins on software are huge at just under 80%. This is how the company's cash flow has grown so well when it seems like it shouldn't have."", ""The other critical element in IBM's new business model is that much of it is recurring. Many of IBM's software and consulting customers pay a monthly fee for ongoing access to these tools. The company's recurring revenue tally now stands at an annualized figure of $14.4 billion, up 7% from the year-ago comparison. Software sales make up the biggest piece of this recurring revenue number, too, which, of course, is also IBM's most profitable arm."", 'The point is that this new business model works. It\'s also ""sticky"" in the sense that once an organization plugs into an IBM platform, it\'s then difficult to wean that organization off of it.', 'But what does this mean for the company and, by extension, for the stock going forward? All predictions should be taken with a grain of salt. Things can always change.', ""An analysis of the business dynamic and trends currently in place suggests IBM's future looks bright. The analyst community believes IBM's annual top line will swell to just under $78 billion by 2028 versus last year's $61.9 billion. Per-share profits are expected to grow from last year's $8.14 to $13.10 in 2027. That's roughly 5% annualized growth for both fiscal measures. And, given Mordor Intelligence's expectation that the global hybrid cloud computing market is set to grow at a yearly pace of 22% through 2029, there's little reason to think the market won't support at least that degree of growth from IBM."", ""The stock's price five years from now, however, is a tricky matter made even trickier by the fact that shares are currently trading slightly above the consensus target of $184.82. Just keep in mind that it's a one-year target; we're looking five years down the road. This simply means long-term-minded investors might want to wait for a modest pullback before taking the plunge. But, many true buy-and-hold investors will want to take that plunge sooner than later."", ""Although it's anything but a growth stock now, and its glory days are clearly all in the past, IBM is relevant again. It's also profitable -- and increasingly so -- supporting a dividend that's not only been paid every quarter for over a century but a dividend that's been raised every year for the past 28 years.

At the time, both tech giants were worth just over $210 billion, and they were both struggling with the seismic shift toward mobile and cloud technologies. But today IBM is worth $168 billion, and Microsoft is worth $3.04 trillion."", 'IBM struggled to expand its on-premise software, hardware, and IT service divisions as its enterprise customers pivoted toward cloud-based services, and it repeatedly reduced its annual revenue by divesting its weaker business segments. Microsoft countered those existential threats by aggressively expanding its Azure cloud infrastructure platform and shrewdly transforming its desktop software into cloud-based services and mobile apps.', ""IBM's mistakes were disappointing, but its CEO Arvind Krishna has made some sweeping changes since taking the helm in April 2020. Could those turnaround efforts breathe fresh life into Big Blue and turn it into a trillion-dollar company by 2030?"", ""Krishna's first major move was the divestment of IBM's slow-growth infrastructure services segment as Kyndryl in Nov. 2021. That divestment eliminated a major weight on the company's top-line and bottom-line growth and freed up more resources for the expansion of its higher-growth hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) services."", ""Krishna was previously IBM's cloud chief, and he likely realized it was too late to catch up to Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google in the public cloud race. However, IBM could still leverage its existing enterprise presence to offer more hybrid cloud services -- which process the data that flows between the private and public clouds -- to companies that aren't quite ready to migrate all of their data to the public cloud. It could also roll out more AI services on its hybrid cloud to process all of that information."", 'That strategy relies heavily on Red Hat, the software maker it acquired for $34 billion in 2019. Red Hat develops open-source software that is universally compatible with a wide range of private and public cloud computing platforms. That flexible mix-and-match approach enables IBM to carve out its own niche and profit from the secular expansion of the cloud and AI markets without directly competing against Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.', 'Krishna also restructured IBM\'s businesses into three simpler segments (software, consulting, and infrastructure), set a goal for generating ""mid-single-digit"" revenue growth from 2022 to 2024, streamlined the company\'s spending, and said it would replace thousands of its human employees with its own AI tools over the next few years.', ""IBM's revenue rose 6% in 2022 and 2% in 2023, and analysts expect 3% growth in 2024. Its adjusted EPS grew 15% in 2022 and 5% in 2023, and is expected to rise 5% in 2024."", ""Those growth rates indicate IBM's turnaround strategies are paying off and turning it into a reliable blue-chip tech stock again. It can also easily support its forward yield of 3.6%, since it only spent 54% of its free cash flow (FCF) on its dividends in 2023. Those attractive qualities brought the bulls back to IBM's stock -- which rallied more than 30% over the past 12 months, yet still looks cheap at 18 times forward earnings."", 'Nevertheless, IBM would still need to grow a lot faster to become a trillion-dollar stock by 2030. Assuming its valuation ratios hold steady, it would need to grow its adjusted EPS at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34% from 2024 to 2030 to boost its market cap sixfold to $1 trillion. That would be a tough target for even higher-growth tech companies like Microsoft to achieve.', ""IBM probably won't follow Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet into the four-comma club anytime soon, but it's still a solid long-term investment. If IBM's multiple remains unchanged, it matches analysts' estimates, and it only grows its adjusted EPS at a CAGR of 5% from 2024 to 2030, it could still be worth $220 billion -- 30% higher than its current market cap -- by the final year. And with annual dividend hikes and reinvested dividends, IBM's stock could easily deliver a total return of 60%-70%."", ""If IBM grows at an even faster rate or commands a higher valuation, we could easily see its stock double by the end of the decade. In other words, Big Blue's strengths should outweigh its weaknesses for the foreseeable future -- even if it doesn't evolve into the next Microsoft or become a trillion-dollar stock."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

Global tourism returned to 87% of pre-pandemic levels during this period. Other findings from the UNWTO also show that during the first nine months of 2023, tourism in the world's most visited region, Europe, hit 94% of pre-pandemic levels, largely due to intra-regional demand and travel from the US. The region received 550 million international tourists, accounting for 56% of the global total."", 'Meanwhile, figures from the Eurostat show that the estimated number of nights spent at tourist accommodation establishments in the EU touched 2.92 billion last year.

', ""The medical and healthcare industry is one of the biggest in the world. The medical industry is assured of a steady demand for its products and services simply due to the fact that human beings are biological creatures. This means that medical stocks such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and hospital stocks such as Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC) are some of the biggest in the world. It also means that these stocks have the potential to capitalize on trends that can suddenly appear due to crises such as the coronavirus pandemic. While the fast paced nature of news cycles in the 21st century means that public focus quickly changes focus, in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic's rapid spread in 2020, investors were fretting and would have given an arm and a leg to prod the crystal ball into telling them which medical stock would be the right bet when it came to navigating the global healthcare prices."", ""As time would tell, medical stocks like Pfizer and the Cambridge, Massachusetts based biotechnology company Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) were some of the hottest due to their vaccines. During the roughly year and a half between December 2019 and September 2021, Moderna's shares appreciated by a whopping 429% on the stock market -\xa0 a result that shows that even small bets made at just the right time can yield juicy profits for investors from all walks of life. Pfizer's stock gained a more modest 50% during the same time period; but the difference between these gains is one that is understandable since Pfizer's current market capitalization of $155 billion is more than four times of Moderna's."", 'Additionally, another key difference between Moderna and Pfizer also applies to the broader categories of medical stocks that include high growth sectors such as biotechnology and somewhat more stable ones like medical device manufacturers and hospital operators. Pfizer, like its peers Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), benefits from one of the classic principles of business management, a.k.a, diversification. These medical stocks have the luxury of sizeable balance sheets that allow them to participate in markets for simple medicines that can be produced at mass scale like blood thinners, as well as medical industry segments requiring massive capital expenditure and research capabilities such as biotechnology and genetic engineering.', ""However, with genetic engineering having entered the conversation, this particular area of medicine benefits from smaller companies that are able to laser focus on being able to change the very 'code' of the human body.

If you want to skip our coverage of the latest stock market news, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Breakout Stocks To Buy Right Now.', ""The stock market in 2024 is more optimistic and forward looking than it was at the start of last year. Back then, investors were fretting about the state of the U.S. economy and the impact that high interest rates from the Federal Reserve would have on it. Yet, as 2023 demonstrated, and much to everyone's surprise, neither did the U.S. economy tip into recession and nor did the stock markets fall and wipe out wealth."", ""Instead, AI prevailed everywhere as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other big ticket technology names soared after OpenAI's ChatGPT convinced the world that A.I. now roams among us."", ""In fact, February 2024 is the first time in its history that the flagship S&P 500 index has crossed 5,000 points. As if this weren't enough, the month has also seen the NASDAQ Composite, dominated by the technology industry, near its all time high levels before paring back the breakout. At the heart of this stunning performance is, you guessed it, A.I. The start of the year has seen industry bigwigs the likes of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) chief Mr. Mark Zuckerberg, NVIDIA boss Jensen Huang, and of course, OpenAI's eccentric Sam Altman all take the stage and reaffirm their optimism for the artificial intelligence industry."", ""It was Zuckerberg who got the ball rolling, as he shared his firm's plans for buying hundreds of thousands of GPUs from NVIDIA this year in order to beef up Meta's computational capacity. Since we'll be talking about breakout stocks in this piece, Meta is particularly important as far as 2024 is concerned. This is because its shares have shown the classic trait of a sudden breakout in the wake of a catalyst. While the Meta chief's GPU comments were nevertheless welcome, the true surge in the firm's shares came after its earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2023. This report saw the firm report a surprise dividend of 50 cents. Since the earnings report, Meta's shares are up by 18%, making it a classical example of a breakout stock."", ""Yet, when we talk about breakout stocks in the A.I. era, the crown is still firmly placed on NVIDIA and Mr. Huang's head. NVIDIA's shares are already up by 49.9% year to date in a blistering set of results that saw NVIDIA briefly become more valuable than big ticket technology stocks Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)."", ""Similarly, another breakout stock that has soared recently is also related to artificial intelligence and also has a close relationship with NVIDIA. This stock is none other than the British semiconductor design house Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM). Arm is one of the youngest entrants on the stock market, and before its shares were publicly listed, NVIDIA was on its way to buy the firm before regulators marred the plans. Well, the decision to go public seems to have served Arm well, since it's a breakout stock that is now up by 145% since its IPO."", ""So why is Arm soaring? Well, all the company had to do was to convince investors that there were A.I. related orders down in the pipeline, and off the shares went. Arm's latest earnings call saw plenty of AI mentions, with the management commenting:"", ""From the most complex devices on the planet for training and inference, the NVIDIA Grace Hopper 200 to edge devices such as the Gemini Nano Pixel 6 from Google or the Samsung Galaxy S24, more and more AI is running on more end devices, and that's all running on Arm. And what that has done is driven a very strong set of tailwinds for our licensing growth. When we look at demand for new products from a licensing standpoint, what we are finding from the end market is that we've reached nowhere near good enough relative to the capability of the technology, and end customers for new designs are needing more and more Arm technology to keep up, particularly with the AI demands."", 'Looking at these trends, it appears that the gods of the stock market are plenty favorable when it comes to breakout stocks.

Like any industry, this one carries risk for investors to be aware of, too. Regulatory changes, payer changes, legal challenges, and the role of patents in this space are all potential risks that investors need to navigate when investing in healthcare stocks.', 'Nonetheless, tried-and-true healthcare businesses with a diverse lineup of market-leading products and strong financials to back them up can pose intriguing buying opportunities for long-term investors. Here are two such healthcare names to consider as you add to your stock portfolio.', 'Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) has long been a leader in the field of surgical robotics, a market that is rapidly expanding as adoption of these solutions grows across various surgical specialties. The company can make anywhere from around $0.7 million to $2.5 million on a single sale of one of its flagship da Vinci surgical robotics systems.', 'However, Intuitive makes far more from the instruments and accessories that go with these suites, which require regular replacement. It also generates substantial revenue from various services it offers its customers, which are often hospitals and other medical providers. These services span on-demand technician services, customer support, software solutions, and more.', ""For every surgical procedure with its da Vinci systems, Intuitive Surgical earns anywhere from $700 to $3,600 in revenue from instruments and accessories. Service contracts for its robotic suites generate annual fees in the ballpark of $80,000 to $200,000 per system. In addition to recurring revenue from instruments, accessories, and services, Intuitive Surgical gets recurring revenue from operating leases for systems that customers don't buy outright."", 'The company has the same business model for its Ion system, a more recent addition to its portfolio, which is approved for use specifically in minimally invasive lung biopsies. In 2023, Intuitive Surgical brought in revenue of $7.1 billion, up 14% from one year ago. Its net income of $1.8 billion represented a 35% year-over-year bump.', 'Of that revenue total, $1.7 billion was derived from system sales or sales-type leases, while $4.3 billion came from instruments and accessories. Services brought in $1.2 billion in revenue for the business in 2023.', ""Over the trailing 12 months, Intuitive Surgical raked in $1.8 billion in operating cash flow. Levered free cash flow for that same period totaled $779 million. If you're looking for a reliable healthcare business model with multiple streams of recurring income, and a solid runway of growth still ahead, Intuitive Surgical satisfies on all counts."", ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) is a leader in cystic fibrosis therapies, with a portfolio of medicines that raked in profits of $3.6 billion on revenue of $9.9 billion in 2023 alone. All of Vertex's approved cystic fibrosis drugs fall into a class of medicines known as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators. CFTR modulators work to correct the underlying genetic cause of cystic fibrosis. To date, Vertex is the only company with approved CFTR modulators on the market."", ""Its top-selling drug is Trikafta, a CFTR modulator that accounted for $8.9 billion (or about 90%) of Vertex's total revenues in 2023. Trikafta sales rose 16% in 2023 from the prior year, and look on track to hit the $10 billion annual sales milestone in the coming year. Even though Trikafta was only approved in 2019, its approval covered about 90% of the cystic fibrosis patient population at that time. Label expansions since that time have driven sales growth forward. Now, cystic fibrosis patients as young as two years of age with certain gene mutations can take Trikafta."", ""That doesn't mean the addressable market opportunity for Vertex is anywhere close to tapped out, though. Management estimates that there are upwards of 92,000 patients in North America, Europe, and Australia who could benefit from its cystic fibrosis medicines. The addressable market in those regions is up from management's previous estimate of 88,000 people several quarters ago. This rapidly growing market opportunity is partly a function of the fact that CFTR regulators are helping patients live longer, which in turn extends the need and demand for these medicines."", 'Vertex is working on a new triple-combination therapy that it expects to seek approval for this year. Clinical trials have shown this therapy to be even more effective than Trikafta. Management estimates that the therapy could be ideally suited for patients who are already taking drugs like Trikafta, as well as a patient population of roughly 6,000 people who have had to stop taking CFTR modulators.', ""Vertex is also working on an mRNA-based cystic fibrosis drug with Moderna for patients who can't take CFTR modulators at all, a patient population that management estimates is at around 5,000 people."", 'Cystic fibrosis is far from the only market opportunity that Vertex is setting its sights on these days. The company just garnered the distinction of being the first in history, along with its development partner CRISPR Therapeutics, to have a CRISPR-based therapy approved. The new therapy, called Casgevy, is a potential one-time functional cure for both sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.', ""Vertex is also working on potential functional cures for other rare diseases, including APOL1-mediated kidney disease and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 20%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.20 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.48. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 9.1% a year over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained."", ""The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. CSX has impressed us by growing EPS at 8.1% per year over the past five years. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting."", 'Overall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that CSX is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.', ""Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the global semiconductor industry, you can go directly to the 5 Most Valuable Semiconductor Companies in the World.', 'According to a report by Deloitte, 2023 was a tumultuous year for the semiconductor industry as it experienced sales declining by 9.4% to $520 billion. This was the seventh downturn the industry went through since 1990. The situation was expected to be much worse, however, many semiconductor companies had stronger second and third quarters. 2024 is anticipated to be a better year with global sales predicted to reach $588 billion and surpass the record revenues of 2022, $574 billion.', 'The memory chip market had the worst drop in sales in 2023, 31%.

In end markets, PC and smartphone sales are expected to grow by 4% in 2024 after going through a downward slump in 2023. Communication and computer chip sales, including data center chips, remain crucial, constituting 56% of overall semiconductor sales in 2022. High inventory levels and declining fab utilization pose challenges for the industry. Inventory levels remained high at over $60 billion in fall 2023. Fab utilization also remained high during the recent shortage.', 'NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSMC), and Broadcom Inc.

Cisco's networking expertise and NVIDIA's GPU technology combined would enable them to deliver secure and scalable Ethernet-based infrastructure."", ""Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSMC) is a Taiwan-based semiconductor company founded in 1987.

The company designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. On December 7, 2023, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. The company reported an EPS of $11.06, beating estimates by $0.1. The company's revenue for the quarter grew by 4.09% and amounted to $9.3 billion, ahead of market consensus by $18.97 million. As of February 15, the company has surged nearly 50.56% over the past six months. Here are some comments from the company's earnings call:"", '""In our fiscal Q4 2023, consolidated net revenue was $9.3 billion, up 4% year-on-year and very much as we had guided at the last conference call. Semiconductor solutions revenue increased 3% year-on-year to $7.3 billion, and infrastructure software revenue grew 7% year-on-year to $2 billion. Overall, while infrastructure software remains very stable, semiconductor is continuing the cyclical slowdown at enterprises and telcos that we have been seeing over the past six months. However, hyperscalers remain strong. Generative AI revenue, driven by Ethernet solutions and custom AI accelerators, represented close to $1.5 billion in Q4 or 20% of semiconductor revenue, while the rest of the semiconductor revenue continued to be rather stable at around $6 billion.""', 'The semiconductor industry is a booming industry with prominent companies competing to meet to growing demand.

The market caps for foreign companies were converted to US dollars based on the exchange rates of the respective country. To quantify the ""value"" or ""size"" of private companies, we selected either the estimated valuation, or the annual revenue available for the most recent fiscal year, or the number of employees, subject to availability of data. The estimated valuation was sourced from major media reports based on the private companies\' latest funding round. The annual revenue or number of employees was sourced from official statements by the company and the company\'s website.

Last year, it was Medical Properties Trust, a healthcare-focused real estate investment trust, while pharmacy chain giant Walgreens Boots Alliance started 2024 with a similar move.', 'These dividend cuts highlight the importance of finding stocks whose businesses are strong enough to support dividend increases even in challenging times. Fortunately, such stocks exist: Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Visa (NYSE: V) are three great examples.', ""As far as dividend track records go, it's hard to find many more impressive than Johnson & Johnson's. The company is on its 61st consecutive year of payout increases and the stock currently yields about 3%. That demonstrates a resilient and innovative business that can navigate challenging conditions, economic and otherwise, while constantly delivering strong financial results. And we can expect more of the same from Johnson & Johnson for many more years as the drugmaker's lineup features more than a dozen blockbusters."", 'Once those run out of patent exclusivity, J&J has a deep pipeline that will help it replace key medicines. The company also boasts a promising medtech division that develops products across several areas. Key growth opportunities here include its robotic-assisted surgery device, Ottava.', ""Johnson & Johnson isn't without risks. The company faces several challenges, including a relatively new law in the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act, that gave Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. The result could be lower sales for the companies that make these medicines, including Johnson & Johnson."", 'However, the drugmaker should be able to handle this issue by developing brand-new medicines that can escape this regulatory burden. Johnson & Johnson remains a top stock that will likely continue paying and raising its dividends for a long time.', ""Apple is best known for the iPhone, but the company's billion-dollar franchise is no longer a source of significant revenue growth. That shouldn't be too much of a problem, though; Apple is adapting its business and still has excellent growth prospects. The company has an installed base of more than 2.2 billion devices whose owners are eager to buy services."", ""Apple's services segment offers a suite of products from music and video streaming to health-related subscriptions. Apple's services don't yet account for most of its revenue, but they have grown faster in recent years."", ""The company's services segment also carries much juicier margins. The result will be stronger net profits, even if that might take awhile. The point is that Apple's business is solid and should continue performing well for a long time."", ""Not only does Apple have more than 2.2 billion people within its ecosystem, but the company's customers are incredibly loyal. Apple's brand name is one of the most valuable in the world and the tech giant's ecosystem is hard to leave unless consumers don't mind abandoning important features that don't carry over to other devices, or losing data."", ""What about the dividend? Apple has increased its payouts by about 104% in the past decade, and still boasts a low cash payout ratio of only 14%. Although the stock yields under 1% right now, the company can raise its dividends substantially without worries. And that's precisely what it's likely to do over the long run."", ""Everyone knows the Visa brand: The company helps facilitate credit card transactions through its payment network. There are millions of such transactions every day, and Visa collects a fee every single time. The company has few direct competitors, partly thanks to its network effect. At this point, any business that doesn't accept Visa as a payment method is practically begging customers to stay away."", ""And the more businesses are plugged into its network, the more consumers getting brand-new credit cards will be attracted to it. This dynamic has been going on for a while and is partly responsible for Visa's strong financial results. Despite millions of credit cards with its logo in circulation, Visa still has excellent growth prospects. The company will continue making money as long as card spending increases and people move away from cash and checks.."", ""That's been an ongoing trend for years, but there's plenty of runway ahead. Visa sees a significant opportunity to digitize cash and check transactions, even in advanced economies like the U.S. So it hasn't reached a ceiling yet -- far from it."", ""The company's dividend record over the past decade has been fantastic. Visa has increased its payouts by an incredible 420% while its cash payout ratio remains conservative at about 20%. The stock currently yields under 1%."", ""Visa's competitive advantage and long-term prospects point to further dividend growth, and that's why dividend investors can safely keep this stock in their portfolios for good."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Johnson & Johnson right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Johnson & Johnson, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Johnson & Johnson wasn’t one of them.

It's an incredible follow-up to the Nasdaq's 43% gain in 2023 and the S&P 500's 24% gain."", ""With some market indices reaching new all-time highs seemingly every day and many stocks becoming more expensive, you may feel like you want to take your foot off the gas ... but you don't know how. Investors in that camp have come to the right place."", 'Here are five responsible moves you can make without overhauling your entire portfolio.', 'If you want to avoid buying stocks you think are overpriced, you can simply allocate new savings to safer stocks. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the S&P 500 is 27.3, but there are many value-oriented sectors of the market that still trade below the market average, like energy, materials, utilities, consumer staples, and financials.', 'The key to building a portfolio over time is just as much about regularly saving and adding new cash to your account as it is about picking the right stocks. Consistently saving takes the pressure off the need to sell a stock to buy a different one.', ""Of course, some investors may be in the asset distribution phase and are slowly withdrawing from their savings rather than building them up. In that case, this step won't apply, but there are still plenty of moves to make."", ""Over the last five years, technology is the only sector that has outperformed the S&P 500, with the communication (led by Meta Platforms and Alphabet) and consumer discretionary (led by Amazon and Tesla) sectors also performing well.The market is being driven higher by big tech. If you've been overly exposed to these sectors, you may be feeling particularly vulnerable to a market pullback. Companies aren't perfectly correlated to each other, but if Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) all sell off, chances are other big tech stocks -- like Adobe, Salesforce, and the major chip players -- will also sell off."", ""A common mistake is assuming a portfolio is diversified because it includes many different stocks when, in reality, weightings and allocation are far more important factors. A portfolio can hold 100 stocks, but if 75% of it is concentrated in just a handful of companies, then it's not as diversified as it may seem at first glance."", 'The counterargument is that you should always go with your highest conviction and best ideas. But now would be a good time to review your portfolio and ensure it achieves the level of diversification needed to suit your risk tolerance.', ""If you find that your portfolio is overly concentrated in a certain sector or theme, you may wonder which stocks you should consider selling. Valuation matters, but an even more important point is the investment thesis. If an investment thesis isn't broken or has gotten even stronger, holding a stock may be a good idea even if it has run up."", ""A good example is Microsoft. Microsoft is up 275% in the last five years and is now the most valuable company in the world. Such a scorching hot stock may seem like it's overbought and ripe for a sell-off. But there are good reasons why Microsoft is a fair value."", 'For starters, the investment thesis has gotten stronger. Microsoft is a higher-margin, faster-growing company today than it was just a few years ago. Its legacy business units are doing well, its cloud business continues to surge, and artificial intelligence is having a measurable effect across its business units.', ""Microsoft has a 36.8 P/E ratio, which seems high. But if Microsoft can grow earnings by 15% or more per year, the stock could begin to look inexpensive rather quickly. A 15% compound annual growth rate results in a doubling in five years. So it wouldn't take a lot for Microsoft to double its earnings five years from now. I think Microsoft will average a growth rate even higher than that, which is why its current valuation is reasonable."", 'You may not want to sell a stock just because it has gone up, especially if the investment thesis justifies the price appreciation.', 'Nvidia was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2023. It is up a staggering 49.2% so far this year, making it the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 again in 2024 so far.', ""Nvidia is a phenomenal business that has a clear runway for several years to come, if not decades. But it has become a story stock. A story stock's valuation is based on what the company could do years from now, not what it is likely to do over the short term or even the medium term. In other words, optimistic investors continue to buy up a stock because they are projecting incredible growth without discounting the uncertainty that the growth will be lower than expected."", 'There are plenty of cases of story stocks living up to the hype, but then underperforming the market because so much growth was already baked into the price. Just look at Tesla, which is down around 50% from its all-time closing high of $409.97 a share on Nov. 4, 2021. Tesla as a company has grown a lot over the last few years, but the stock was priced to perfection.', ""The more Nvidia stock goes up, the more it will have to deliver blowout results quarter after quarter. At a certain point, it becomes unsustainable. An industrywide downturn, competition, or any unknown could throw a wrench in the growth rate and make the stock overvalued. It's unclear whether Nvidia is overvalued just yet. But it's the kind of company that could be worth trimming if you had, say, 5% of your portfolio in the company and now it has grown to 25%."", 'The absolute worst thing an investor can do is think the market has peaked and sell their entire portfolio (or close to it). History shows that every dip in the market turned out to be a worthwhile buying opportunity. The stock market may not have a blowout performance for the rest of the year and may even sell off. But making all-or-nothing decisions in the stock market is a great way to lose your shirt.', ""We're all human, so there's a psychological element to investing that's worth monitoring. The best way to invest is by building positions over time, rather than trading in and out of stocks or sectors. The ideas discussed here may lead you to make a few portfolio moves, but they shouldn't result in a complete portfolio makeover."", ""High-quality, expensive stocks tend to grow into their valuations over time. If you're a long-term investor, the objective should be to stay involved in the stock market, not jump in and out when things look frothy. If you're fighting the urge to sell everything, you may want to review your reasons for investing and ensure they align with your financial goals."", ""If you've been investing long enough, chances are you've been through the roller coaster of emotions that come with market volatility. You'll never make perfect decisions, but you can put yourself in a position to stay level-headed by going through healthy portfolio moves that are measured and not over the top."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The S&P 500 crossed 5,000 for the first time ever; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is making new all-time highs regularly. ', 'Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite, the most tech-heavy of the major indexes, is riding a wave of artificial intelligence (AI) optimism right into the stratosphere. Over the last 12 months, that index is up 33%.', ""With so many new highs being made, some stock prices have reached towering heights. So let's talk stock splits and cover three stocks -- Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) -- that are ready."", 'Jake Lerch (Super Micro Computer): If I had to pick one stock as the mascot for the current bull market, it just might be Super Micro Computer. Its shares generated a mind-blowing total return of 774% in the last 12 months. ', ""To put that in context, it's taken Microsoft (which is no slouch regarding stock performance) the last eight years to generate a similar total return."", ""Super Micro Computer's rapid rise has seen its stock price shoot up from around $86 a share to over $880. That, my friends, is a recipe for a stock split. The company has never conducted a stock split in its 17 years as a public company. However, with its stock price closing in on $900 a share and investor interest surging, it might be time."", ""The company's near-term prospects look spectacular as the AI revolution drives up demand for its off-the-shelf server racks -- one of the primary building blocks for AI data centers. The company reported exceptional earnings results a few weeks ago, lifted its full-year guidance, and provided highly upbeat commentary in a post-earnings conference call."", ""In short, given the stock's amazing run, now could be the right time for Super Micro Computer to perform its first stock split -- a development many investors would cheer."", 'Will Healy (Nvidia): Amid the generative AI boom, Nvidia has been on a tear. Over the last year, the stock has risen almost 240% as demand for chips designed for AI workloads has boomed. That took the share price to around $740 per share as of the time of this writing.', 'Coincidentally, that places its price near where Nvidia last executed a 4-for-1 stock split, in July 2021, with the stock up nearly 300% since then.', ""Along with the company's current stock price, Nvidia's market positioning and growth appear to make a case for another split. It has an estimated 85% market share in the high-end AI chip market, according to an analyst at Raymond James. Moreover, Allied Market Research estimates a compound annual growth rate of 38% for the AI chip market through 2032."", 'Given such numbers, it should come as little surprise that its revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 29) rose 206% yearly to more than $18 billion. With that, the gross margin surged to 74% versus 54% in the year-ago quarter, when operating expenses rose by 16%.', ""Consequently, Nvidia's net income of over $9.2 billion rose by nearly 14 times! Amid such increases, its P/E ratio of 97 has not deterred investors from bidding the stock higher."", ""Additionally, Nvidia may have another less discussed reason for wanting a split. At a market cap of $1.8 trillion, it has arguably become the market's most essential semiconductor stock. A lower nominal share price would make it a leading candidate for inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial index. The Dow is a price-weighted index, and Nvidia's addition would add to its prestige and investor interest, serving as yet another positive catalyst."", 'Indeed, when it comes to semiconductor stocks, none appears better positioned than Nvidia. And with its continuing growth prospects and history, a stock split could make it more appealing to prospective buyers and indexes alike.', ""Justin Pope (Meta Platforms): In late 2022, when shares were just $89, most investors probably didn't have a possible stock split for Meta Platforms on their bingo cards. But Wall Street will soon wrap up Q1 of 2024, and the stock is quickly running toward $500. This epic comeback is no fluke. The stock on fire since overcoming adversity in its advertising business and cutting expenses to get its profits back on track."", ""Lost in the stock's ups and downs were two consistent truths. First, Meta's three-headed monster of social media apps, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, never stopped growing. Monthly active users rose from 3.71 billion in Q3 of 2022, when the stock bottomed, to 3.98 billion today. That doesn't seem like much, but half the world's population is on these apps, and Meta's audience is still rising at a meaningful pace."", ""Second, Meta has continually invested in building computing systems for the company's long-term AI ambitions. Meta is already using AI to grow its advertising business, and the consumer-facing nature of Meta's apps gives the company tons of room for innovation over time."", ""Stock splits don't change a company's fundamental valuation. Fortunately, Meta's forward P/E of 23 is attractive if the business delivers the 20% annualized earnings growth analysts expect. If Meta does split its stock, the numbers make it a stock split you can confidently buy and hold for the long term."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

The lion's share of its revenue is generated by digital advertising, and using AI helps surface more relevant ads and appropriate content for its social media users."", ""With the ongoing recovery in ad spending, 2023 was a banner year for the world's second-largest digital advertiser.

Many big tech companies followed suit, and the AI arms race was on.', 'Microsoft made the most of its investment, quickly integrating AI functionality across a broad cross-section of its most popular productivity tools. It further bolstered demand by offering the most sought-after AI models on its Azure Cloud.', ""One of the biggest opportunities, however, rests in its suite of AI-fueled assistants: Microsoft Copilot. The ability of these tools to increase users' productivity has resulted in strong demand, which could generate incremental revenue of $100 billion by 2027, according to the I/O Fund's Beth Kindig. Azure's growth outpaced the competition in the fourth quarter, and Microsoft noted that 6 percentage points of that growth came from increased demand for AI services."", ""Microsoft currently trades for 35 times forward earnings. That's a slight premium to the overall market, but the company's strong history of growth and the additional potential resulting from AI make it a must-own AI stock, which likely provided extra incentive for Coleman to buy."", 'Amazon also has a long history of deploying AI algorithms to manage its e-commerce business, using AI to make product recommendations, manage inventory levels, schedule delivery routes, and more.', 'The company has also jumped on the generative AI bandwagon, using the technology to improve product descriptions, summarize reviews, and polish merchant advertising.

Originally designed to process gaming graphics, its uses have been expanded to tasks like drug discovery, engineering simulations, mining cryptocurrency, and training AI models."", ""Artificial intelligence has been the latest demand driver for Nvidia, and its results are spectacular. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 30), revenue rose an incredible 206% year over year to $18.1 billion. But the company isn't done as management expects fourth-quarter revenue to more than triple year over year to about $20 billion."", 'Growth of this magnitude at a company as large as Nvidia is almost unparalleled, making the stock such an incredible story.

I figured that once the initial onslaught of AI-driven GPU demand was over, revenue would fall off a cliff. This is exactly what happened in 2019 and 2022 when the cryptocurrency market crashed and demand for GPUs dropped."", ""I still believe this drop will happen, but it won't occur nearly as quickly as I expected. The demand for Nvidia's GPUs is unbelievable. Take Tesla, for example.

I'll discuss what Arm does, its financials, and its stock below."", 'First, here is what Arm does not do. Arm does not actually make any semiconductors (or ""chips""). Arm sells the ""architecture"" for companies like Nvidia, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), and Samsung (OTC: SSNL.F). The list goes on, but you get the idea.\xa0I can almost guarantee that you used an Arm-based product today because 99% of all smartphones have CPUs built with Arm technology. Here\'s how it works.', ""Arm designs the specifications for chips that are energy-efficient, high-powered, and meet its customers' specifications for the end market. The company buys the design from Arm (saving millions or billions on research and development) and pays Arm a license fee. Then, it pays Arm a royalty fee for each unit sold. As of Arm's most recent quarter, 280 billion units have shipped since its inception, including 7.7 billion in the quarter."", ""Because of the low-power, high-performance nature of Arm chips, Apple replaced Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) chips in its Macs with Arm-based chips, and Arm is used by Amazon Web Services (AWS)(NASDAQ: AMZN) server chips. Arm's superior technology is exciting investors as it increases its adoption, including in growing markets like Automotive."", 'Arm stock is not without risks. The company receives 20% of its revenue from China. This creates geopolitical headaches. The industry is highly competitive, and Arm is exposed to economic slowdowns because it generates more than half of its sales from mobile phones and consumer electronics. But results are encouraging.', ""Total revenue was $824 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, a 14% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Operating income was $338 million on an impressive 41% margin. Arm also has an enviable business model. Since it doesn't make the chips, its capital expenditures (equipment purchases) are very low, creating more free cash flow (FCF). Thirty cents of every revenue dollar went into the company's pocket last quarter."", ""What really excited investors last quarter probably wasn't the 14% increase in sales, though. It was the $2.4 billion remaining performance obligation, as shown below."", 'RPO is similar to a backlog. It represents contracts signed that will produce revenue in future quarters. RPO was up 38% YOY last quarter, building on the significant jump in the fiscal second quarter. This is clear evidence of increased adoption of Arm technology.', ""Arm stock experienced a meteoric rise after third-quarter earnings, pushing the valuation metrics off the charts. Its price-to-sales (P/S) and forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios stand at 124 and 52, respectively. Compare this to high-flying Nvidia's 40 and 35, and you can see that Arm stock will probably return to Earth soon. Investors should be cautious about buying at this level while looking for a better entry point. Arm has a tremendous future."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

However, upon further investigation, I learned something pretty interesting.', 'When SoundHound AI was still a private company, it raised hundreds of millions of dollars, primarily from venture capital (VC) firms. However, the company also attracted funding from a number of high-profile technology firms, including Tencent and Samsung.', 'And back in 2017, Nvidia participated in a $75 million investment round too.', ""Given Nvidia has been tied to SoundHound AI for several years, I'd caution investors against reading too much into Ives' post on social media. The company already has a number of impressive partners, including Qualcomm, Oracle, Block, and Toast. And the relationship with Nvidia isn't really anything new, technically. It's also not clear how SoundHound AI and Nvidia plan to work together -- if at all."", ""The role that artificial intelligence can play in voice recognition software shouldn't be underappreciated. It's clearly an area that many in big tech are exploring, and I suspect it's still early days for speech-based products. While the potential for SoundHound AI could be massive, investors should be wary of pouring into the stock based on this latest news."", ""SoundHold AI has built up a lot of momentum. While this presents a quick opportunity to make a profit, you could very well be left a bag holder if you're not careful.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Worst States for Homeowners Insurance in the US. ', 'A climate insurance bubble penetrated the United States in 2023. This bubble is formed when climate risks result in insurance payouts that surpass the premiums that insurers are collecting, ultimately leading to higher rates from insurers. The effect of this bubble is that higher costs of home insurance increase the homeownership costs and are likely to bring home prices in risky areas down. You can also view the most dangerous states for natural disasters. Although the number of uninsurable places rose in all states of the US during this crisis, some of them were more affected. On June 19, 2023, CNN reported that those residing in Florida had to pay insurance premiums almost four times as compared to the rest of the US as home insurers were driven out of Florida.', 'Apart from the climate risk, home insurance companies have also cited the rising costs of repairing, building supplies, and labor as their reason to move out. The rebuilding and replacement costs went up by 55% between 2019 and 2022. The important fact in this regard is that insurance rates have not climbed a lot across the country but in states where home insurance is already hard to find.', 'Louisiana is subject to high costs of home insurance among other US states as 69% of state residents expressed how homeowner’s insurance costs more in Louisiana when compared to other states in 2023. Many of these residents tried to secure an insurance policy but faced trouble in obtaining one.', 'The aforementioned crisis has also been persistent in 2024. Existing homeowners in states vulnerable to natural disasters seem to be in a fix since they are running out of insurance options while the remaining options are too costly to afford. On February 5, CNBC reported that home insurers continue to leave markets or have simply stopped writing policies in areas that are more prone to fires and floods. One of the most prominent national insurers State Farm halted taking new applications for policies on Californian properties. The company presented the rationale that climate-related calamities were damaging many buildings in the state and the cost of repairing was even higher due to inflation. Another example of a state where homeowners are feeling deprived of ample or affordable home insurance policies is Florida where the flood risk is high.', 'The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL), The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV), and Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) are some of the dominant home insurance companies in the US. Let’s take a look at what these firms have been up to.', 'The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) is a popular American insurance company. The firm’s agents can help homeowners get the right coverage based on their needs. On February 15, The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) reported the catastrophe losses and implemented rates for the month of January. The after-tax estimate of these losses was $218 million. The company implemented rate increases for auto as well as homeowners insurance. Rate increases for homeowners insurance have been forecasted to increase annualized written premiums by almost $40 million.', 'The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV) provides homeowners with feasible insurance options after evaluating the features of their home and their current homeowners insurance coverage. It offers an early quote discount as well as a discount if the client has three policies with the company. On January 19, The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV) reported its financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $7.01, beating EPS estimates by $1.92. The company’s revenue for the quarter amounted to $9.97 billion, up 13.11% year-over-year and ahead of revenue consensus by $26.25 million.', 'Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) is the parent company of the global insurance provider, Chubb. Chubb offers insurance products covering property and casualty, accident and health, reinsurance, and life insurance. The company’s homeowner insurance policies are available across all US states. On January 30, Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) reported strong earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $5.54, beating EPS estimates by $0.42. The company generated revenue of $10.15 billion which increased 12.47% year-over-year and surpassed market consensus by $72.60 million.', 'You can also take a look at some of the best-manufactured home insurance companies heading into 2024.

This is because we have considered the cost factor for determining how convenient the states are for homeowners. Furthermore, states that are prone to more natural disaster risks tend to have higher insurance rates.

Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 8th of March to $0.67. This takes the annual payment to 2.0% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry."", ' View our latest analysis for Yum! Brands ', ""We like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. The last dividend was quite easily covered by Yum! Brands' earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 32.3%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 34% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.', ""Although the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $1.34, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.68. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 7.2% per annum over that time. A reasonable rate of dividend growth is good to see, but we're wary that the dividend history is not as solid as we'd like, having been cut at least once."", ""Growing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Earnings have grown at around 3.5% a year for the past five years, which isn't massive but still better than seeing them shrink. Growth of 3.5% per annum is not particularly high, which might explain why the company is paying out a higher proportion of earnings. This isn't bad in itself, but unless earnings growth pick up we wouldn't expect dividends to grow either."", ""In summary, it's great to see that the company can raise the dividend and keep it in a sustainable range. The dividend has been at reasonable levels historically, but that hasn't translated into a consistent payment. The payment isn't stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio."", ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for Yum!

If you are not interested in reading about the landscape of expensive medical treatments, head straight to the 5 Most Expensive Medical Treatments/Procedures In The World.', ""In today's ever-evolving landscape of medical advancements, some treatments and procedures stand out for their efficacy and staggering cost. From groundbreaking gene therapies to intricate surgical interventions, healthcare offers an array of options for those seeking cutting-edge treatment. However, alongside these medical marvels comes a hefty price tag, sometimes reaching astronomical figures.\xa0"", 'The most expensive medical treatments and procedures globally encompass a range of interventions, including organ transplants, heart surgeries, and specific cancer treatments. These procedures incur significant costs due to surgical complexity, specialized equipment requirements, extensive post-operative care, and high medical personnel and technology expenses.\xa0\xa0', 'For instance, a kidney transplant may\xa0cost\xa0around $262,900, while a gastrointestinal transplant can exceed $1,206,000. A routine medical consultation with a general practitioner averages around\xa0$190\xa0in the United States, known for its costly healthcare system. The global medical treatment market is marked by substantial investments in research, advanced technology, and the expenses related to medical personnel and equipment. In 2021, the U.S. spent a staggering\xa0$4.1 trillion\xa0on healthcare, equivalent to 18% of its GDP.\xa0\xa0', 'Managing the high costs of medical treatments is a pressing concern globally, with countries grappling to balance healthcare expenses against the imperative of delivering quality care. Despite the financial challenges posed by expensive medical procedures, they play a pivotal role in addressing complex illnesses such as organ failure, heart diseases, and certain cancers, significantly enhancing patient outcomes and extending lives.\xa0\xa0', 'However, the exorbitant costs of these treatments present significant financial burdens for individuals and healthcare systems.\xa0Studies\xa0have consistently highlighted the financial strain imposed by expensive medical treatments. For instance, the average cost of a hospitalization for an appendectomy is approximately $33,000 in the U.S., compared to about €600 in France. Such disparities underscore the importance of comprehensive international health insurance to mitigate the financial impact of costly medical interventions.\xa0\xa0', 'In light of economic dynamics, McKinsey & Company forecasts a 4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the healthcare industry from 2021 to 2026, with anticipated profits reaching\xa0$790 billion. This projection marks a revision from an earlier forecast of 6%, attributed to inflationary pressures and labor shortages posing challenges to industry growth.\xa0\xa0', 'A 2021 report by the American Association of Medical Colleges predicts substantial shortages in surgical sectors by 2030, partly due to the prohibitive costs of medical education and student debt burdens. The anticipated profit increase is expected to stem from various factors, including changes in payer demographics, with the aging population favoring Medicare Advantage.\xa0\xa0', 'However, legislative shifts affecting eligibility criteria may lead to a decline in enrollment by approximately 10 million individuals over the next five years. Despite challenges, industry margins are forecasted to recover post-pandemic, with a projected CAGR of 15%. Additionally, ongoing costs associated with managing endemic COVID-19 are estimated to exceed $200 billion annually.\xa0', ""Pharmaceutical monopolies wield significant influence over the pricing of medical treatments, creating a complex marketplace characterized by competing interests and variable pricing structures. The industry's profitability is notable, with approximately\xa067%\xa0of drug companies experiencing an uptick in annual average profit margins from 2006 to 2015. This surge in profitability is a result of the industry's rapid growth, with global sales surpassing\xa0$1.2 trillion\xa0in 2020.\xa0"", 'The high profitability of the pharmaceutical sector correlates with increased investment in new drug development. Manufacturers are incentivized by larger markets and revenue streams, leading to expanded research and development efforts. However, concerns arise regarding the pricing of specific medical treatments, often attributed to market consolidation among drug companies. Such consolidation can diminish competition and contribute to inflated prices.\xa0', 'The demand for expensive medical treatments is multifaceted, influenced by shifting patterns in chronic disease prevalence, robust sales of new products, and the expansion of third-party drug coverage. Third-party coverage tends to bolster demand by offsetting the financial burden for patients, allowing manufacturers to justify higher prices and allocate more resources to drug development.\xa0', ""Among the most significant 25 drug companies, pharmaceutical and biotechnology revenues and profit margins witnessed growth between 2006 and 2015, underscoring the industry's resilience and profitability amid evolving market dynamics.\xa0"", 'In the dynamic landscape of pharmaceutical innovation and biotechnology, companies like Gilead Sciences, Inc.

Esophageal cancer treatment costs annually range from $30,000 to $200,000. The average\xa0price\xa0of esophageal surgeries is approximately $55,200, with some procedures reaching $113,756. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, depending on the cancer type and stage.\xa0\xa0', 'Treatment Cost: $46,763\xa0', ""Endovascular procedures on the skull, meninges, and brain are one of the most expensive medical treatments/procedures in the world, averaging $46,763 before insurance. They're used to treat complex issues like aneurysms and artery disorders. Due to their delicate nature, these surgeries require a specialized team of neurosurgeons, ENT surgeons, and radiologists. Factors like facility fees and device expenses influence the costs. These procedures are vital for treating conditions such as cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations, and can involve either minimally invasive endoscopic techniques or traditional open surgery.\xa0"", 'Treatment Cost: $47,114\xa0', 'The average retail price of a bowel-to-bowel fusion operation in the United States is $47,114. However, costs vary widely, ranging from less than $15,000 to nearly $69,000 at different hospitals. Without insurance, the procedure can cost between $30,000 and $120,000, influenced by hospital, location, and pre or post-surgery care. While bowel-to-bowel fusion can be a significant expense, it is not among the most expensive medical procedures in the world, which typically include heart and organ transplants costing hundreds of thousands to over a million dollars.\xa0', 'Average Treatment Cost: $66,935\xa0', 'A craniotomy is a complex surgical procedure involving the removal of part of the skull to access the brain, typically performed to treat conditions such as brain tumors, aneurysms, and traumatic brain injuries. It ranks among the\xa0most expensive medical procedures globally\xa0due to substantial associated costs, including hospital charges, surgeon fees, anesthesia, and post-operative care. The average cost before insurance is around $66,935, but prices can vary widely based on factors like the type of procedure and location of the medical facility. ', 'Single-use instrument costs for craniotomies also contribute significantly to expenses. A\xa0study\xa0emphasizes the need for cost awareness and efficient allocation of resources to manage overall costs. For commercially insured neurosurgical patients, mean out-of-pocket spending exceeded $1400 in 2016, with an average annual growth rate of 13%. Treatment costs for brain cancer, often involving craniotomy, can range from $30,000 to\xa0$100,000,\xa0adding to the financial burden for patients and families.\xa0', 'Average Treatment Cost: $102,399\xa0', 'Tracheostomy, a procedure creating a neck opening for a breathing tube, is one of the most expensive medical treatments/procedures in the world, with U.S. hospitals charging an average of $102,399. Studies\xa0show that managing a tracheostomy patient costs $192,184 Australian dollars. Timing impacts cost-effectiveness, with early tracheostomy potentially more cost-effective. Costs encompass hospital stay, multidisciplinary care, and complications. Factors like timing, technique (percutaneous vs. surgical), and hospital stay length affect total care costs. Percutaneous tracheostomy reduces procedure costs by avoiding operating room charges, but overall costs vary due to multiple factors.\xa0', 'Average Treatment Cost: $115,000\xa0', 'Spinal fusion is a significant and costly medical procedure used to address various spinal conditions. Its cost varies widely depending on factors such as location and specific circumstances. For instance, average prices for lumbar spinal fusion in the U.S. range from $86,182 in Denver to $48,169 in San Antonio. Costs vary by state, with estimates ranging based on historical cash prices. Regional variations show lower costs in the Midwest and higher costs in the Northeast. Direct costs for single-level lumbar fusions range from\xa0$8,286\xa0to $73,727. The significant cost differences underscore the need for transparency and understanding in healthcare pricing. Individuals should consult with healthcare providers and insurance plans for specific cost information.\xa0', 'Average Treatment Cost: $137,533\xa0', ""Exploratory chest surgery is among the most expensive medical procedures globally, with U.S. hospitals charging an average of $137,533 per procedure, making it the costliest single medical procedure in the country. It's often performed as emergency surgery following accidents or injuries to assess potential risks involving the heart and lungs. The high cost is attributed to its complexity, danger, need for specialized equipment, lengthy preparation, rehabilitation, and medications. The extensive resources required for pre-diagnostic surgeries and post-operative care also contribute to the overall expense. This surgery involves a thorough examination and potential interventions on vital organs, adding to its high cost.\xa0"", 'Average Treatment Cost: $170,000\xa0', 'Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is a significant and costly procedure for treating aortic valve disease. Costs vary widely, with average total charges of\xa0$18,923\xa0in Eastern China and reimbursements in the United States ranging from $32,000 to $94,000\xa0per case. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) devices alone can cost $32,500. Factors contributing to the high cost include surgery complexity, specialized personnel, advanced devices, and post-operative care. AVR can be performed through open-heart surgery or minimally invasive techniques, each with associated costs and risks. Indirect costs include hospital stay duration, post-operative care, and potential complications.\xa0\xa0', 'Average Treatment Cost: $275,000\xa0', 'A small bowel transplant is a highly complex and of the most expensive medical treatments/procedures in the world, with average costs ranging from approximately $275,000 to $1,147,300 in the United States, which includes pre-transplant evaluation, surgical procedures, post-transplant care, and lifelong immunosuppressive medications. Post-transplant costs for pediatric cases can amount\xa0to around $263,724, with an average hospital stay of 51.5 days. ', ""The high price is attributed to the procedure's complexity, the need for lifelong immunosuppression, and intensive post-transplant care. Despite the initial expense, small bowel transplants can be\xa0cost-effective\xa0and even cost-saving compared to long-term parenteral nutrition, mainly due to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs in the years following the transplant.\xa0"", 'Average Treatment Cost: $275,000\xa0', 'Intestinal transplants are costly, ranging from $275,000 to $1,147,300 per case in the US due to surgery complexity, post-transplant care, and immunosuppressive therapy.

One is a therapy for a type of muscular dystrophy called myotonic dystrophy, which affects about 110,000 patients in Europe and North America but has no approved therapies to treat it.', 'The other is a treatment for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which has over 250,000 patients just in the U.S. and Europe. ADPKD is without a cure at this time; the current standard of care for most patients is either dialysis or a kidney transplant.', 'Vertex has financial strength with billions in profits and revenue flowing in each year, while looking to the future within the rare-disease drug market.

Eylea is also approved for a variety of ailments including diabetic retinopathy and wet age-related macular degeneration.', 'Exclusivity for existing Dupixent patents continues until the beginning of the next decade, but approval for new indications could extend the revenue potential of this drug even longer. For example, Regeneron is currently seeking approval for Dupixent as a treatment for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and type 2 inflammation.', 'COPD patients with type 2 inflammation represent 20% to 40% of the entire COPD patient population.

But they're not massive just because it stands to crank out billions in additional revenue. Instead, the plan is to shell out the equivalent of $100 million so that the potential new drug can compete for the market share of one of its already commercialized medicines as soon as possible."", ""What's going on here? It's time to dig in and figure it out so that investors can decide what to do."", 'Per the results of a phase 3 clinical trial reported Feb. 5, Vertex\'s latest candidate for treating cystic fibrosis (CF), a rare and serious genetic disease of the lung, is both safe and effective. The medicine is currently called ""vanza triple"" because it combines the molecule vanzacaftor and two other drugs. One of the three compounds, tezacaftor, is already in one of the company\'s medicines on the market, though the others aren\'t.', ""In the clinical trial, the vanza triple combo performed at least as well as Trikafta, the biopharma's best-selling product for CF. By one metric -- how much the therapy reduced the level of detectable chloride in patients' sweat -- the combo was superior, and its side effect burden comparable. That poses an interesting problem."", 'In 2023, Trikafta was responsible for roughly $9 billion in sales from a top line of roughly $10 billion. If the new medicine gets approval from regulators at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which management plans to petition for by mid-2024, Vertex will have two products in direct competition with each other on the market simultaneously. There is likely not any opportunity for patients to take both therapies at once, and it is unclear whether there is a chance that a large group of patients will respond better to the older combination than the new one.', ""Therefore, the probability of the vanza triple combination cannibalizing Trikafta's market share is very high. Investors may balk at any decision to proceed and go for the approval as they would rather continue milking revenue from sales of Trikafta for years and years, transitioning to a new product only when generic competitors start to encroach."", ""And they might balk even harder at the management-endorsed idea of expending an asset worth in the ballpark of $100 million to start the cannibalization process even faster. The asset in question is what's called a priority review voucher (PRV), which is a government-issued piece of paper that entitles the bearer to get (you guessed it) a privileged regulatory status in the review stages of the drug approval process, thereby cutting the time it takes to go from submitting the paperwork to getting a decision on commercialization by a handful of months. In recent times, many biopharmas have traded PRVs to each other, preferring to get cash rather than save time, and $100 million is the value of a typical sale."", ""Investors are likely to wonder why management seems to be in such a hurry to torpedo the company's most successful product."", ""Vertex isn't being impatient, nor is the decision to use the PRV a poor one. In fact, the move was carefully calculated and will likely turn out for the best for patients and shareholders alike. Here's why."", 'Per management, a smaller proportion of revenue from sales of the vanza triple drug will be siphoned off to pay out royalties to external parties than with its existing portfolio of CF medicines. So, by commercializing the vanza combination, the business will fatten its profit margin, even if it does not dramatically increase its revenue, because it will pay fewer royalties.', 'Using the PRV thus implies that management sees the earnings benefit of getting the drug to market a bit faster as being larger than the sale price of the voucher. That perspective is all the more credible when taking the royalty issue into account, as it significantly changes the economic benefit of each month the medicine spends on the market.', ""Furthermore, it's important to recognize that this isn't Vertex's first rodeo when it comes to gracefully replacing one of its older products with a shinier newer version that works a bit better.\xa0If anything, the company is an expert at cannibalizing its CF market share again and again while still growing, having commercialized four different but overlapping drugs in succession over the years.

Like any industry, this one carries risk for investors to be aware of, too. Regulatory changes, payer changes, legal challenges, and the role of patents in this space are all potential risks that investors need to navigate when investing in healthcare stocks.', 'Nonetheless, tried-and-true healthcare businesses with a diverse lineup of market-leading products and strong financials to back them up can pose intriguing buying opportunities for long-term investors. Here are two such healthcare names to consider as you add to your stock portfolio.', 'Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) has long been a leader in the field of surgical robotics, a market that is rapidly expanding as adoption of these solutions grows across various surgical specialties. The company can make anywhere from around $0.7 million to $2.5 million on a single sale of one of its flagship da Vinci surgical robotics systems.', 'However, Intuitive makes far more from the instruments and accessories that go with these suites, which require regular replacement. It also generates substantial revenue from various services it offers its customers, which are often hospitals and other medical providers. These services span on-demand technician services, customer support, software solutions, and more.', ""For every surgical procedure with its da Vinci systems, Intuitive Surgical earns anywhere from $700 to $3,600 in revenue from instruments and accessories. Service contracts for its robotic suites generate annual fees in the ballpark of $80,000 to $200,000 per system. In addition to recurring revenue from instruments, accessories, and services, Intuitive Surgical gets recurring revenue from operating leases for systems that customers don't buy outright."", 'The company has the same business model for its Ion system, a more recent addition to its portfolio, which is approved for use specifically in minimally invasive lung biopsies. In 2023, Intuitive Surgical brought in revenue of $7.1 billion, up 14% from one year ago. Its net income of $1.8 billion represented a 35% year-over-year bump.', 'Of that revenue total, $1.7 billion was derived from system sales or sales-type leases, while $4.3 billion came from instruments and accessories. Services brought in $1.2 billion in revenue for the business in 2023.', ""Over the trailing 12 months, Intuitive Surgical raked in $1.8 billion in operating cash flow. Levered free cash flow for that same period totaled $779 million. If you're looking for a reliable healthcare business model with multiple streams of recurring income, and a solid runway of growth still ahead, Intuitive Surgical satisfies on all counts."", ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) is a leader in cystic fibrosis therapies, with a portfolio of medicines that raked in profits of $3.6 billion on revenue of $9.9 billion in 2023 alone. All of Vertex's approved cystic fibrosis drugs fall into a class of medicines known as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators. CFTR modulators work to correct the underlying genetic cause of cystic fibrosis. To date, Vertex is the only company with approved CFTR modulators on the market."", ""Its top-selling drug is Trikafta, a CFTR modulator that accounted for $8.9 billion (or about 90%) of Vertex's total revenues in 2023. Trikafta sales rose 16% in 2023 from the prior year, and look on track to hit the $10 billion annual sales milestone in the coming year. Even though Trikafta was only approved in 2019, its approval covered about 90% of the cystic fibrosis patient population at that time. Label expansions since that time have driven sales growth forward. Now, cystic fibrosis patients as young as two years of age with certain gene mutations can take Trikafta."", ""That doesn't mean the addressable market opportunity for Vertex is anywhere close to tapped out, though. Management estimates that there are upwards of 92,000 patients in North America, Europe, and Australia who could benefit from its cystic fibrosis medicines. The addressable market in those regions is up from management's previous estimate of 88,000 people several quarters ago. This rapidly growing market opportunity is partly a function of the fact that CFTR regulators are helping patients live longer, which in turn extends the need and demand for these medicines."", 'Vertex is working on a new triple-combination therapy that it expects to seek approval for this year. Clinical trials have shown this therapy to be even more effective than Trikafta. Management estimates that the therapy could be ideally suited for patients who are already taking drugs like Trikafta, as well as a patient population of roughly 6,000 people who have had to stop taking CFTR modulators.', ""Vertex is also working on an mRNA-based cystic fibrosis drug with Moderna for patients who can't take CFTR modulators at all, a patient population that management estimates is at around 5,000 people."", 'Cystic fibrosis is far from the only market opportunity that Vertex is setting its sights on these days. The company just garnered the distinction of being the first in history, along with its development partner CRISPR Therapeutics, to have a CRISPR-based therapy approved. The new therapy, called Casgevy, is a potential one-time functional cure for both sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.', ""Vertex is also working on potential functional cures for other rare diseases, including APOL1-mediated kidney disease and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

It owns more than 200 unique beverage brands, and a global footprint makes it one of the most successful beverage companies in the world."", ""However, with the company operating everywhere, achieving growth becomes increasingly difficult. Although revenue and earnings have continued to increase, investors should not count on the beverage stock to beat the market. Here's why."", ""For all of Coca-Cola's problems, investors can feel assured that neither the company nor its brands are going anywhere. Amid price increases, customers are mostly staying loyal to its brands."", 'Unfortunately for shareholders, companies typically need to thrive rather than merely survive to drive significant returns. The stock continues to rise, but it has underperformed the S&P 500 for years. Moreover, the 2023 earnings report indicates prosperity will not return anytime soon.', 'Its 2023 net operating revenue rose 6% from year-ago levels to $46 billion. Still, Coca-Cola raised prices 10% in 2023 and 11% in 2022, meaning revenue did not grow in proportion to price increases.', ""The company's net income rose 12% to nearly $11 billion. While that seems like a decent return, higher spending on operating charges and property and equipment took a toll on free cash flow."", 'In the end, 2023 free cash flow was $9.7 billion, but that was up only 2% from 2022 levels. During that time, the company spent over $8 billion in dividends, 4% more than year-ago levels. Since the company spent $1.7 billion in net share repurchases, it had little capital to reinvest in the business.', 'Additionally, the dividend costs are potentially problematic because the company has increased its dividend for 62 straight years. This gives it Dividend King status, which is both a benefit and a trap. The Dividend King status raises demand for shares, but if the company walked away from this status, its share value would likely suffer for years as such a move would probably undermine confidence in Coca-Cola stock.', 'Moreover, the company does not seem intent on improving this situation. Coca-Cola chose to hike the payout by more than 5% this year to $1.94 per share annually. The company can maintain Dividend King status with any level of increase, so it is not a good sign that the dividend rises at a rate that exceeds free cash flow growth.', 'Furthermore, larger increases may be unnecessary since shareholders can earn a dividend yield of 3.3%, more than double the S&P 500 average of 1.4%. With the burden of the dividend hampering Coca-Cola and its stock price growth, few investors may want to add shares, especially at a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.', ""That premium may explain why one longtime shareholder, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, has not purchased additional shares since 1994. Still, with Berkshire set to earn $776 million in dividends this year on an original $1.3 billion investment, Berkshire and other long-term shareholders have every incentive to hold their shares."", 'Unfortunately, Coca-Cola stock will likely leave most investors thirsty. Indeed, its brands remain popular amid price increases, and its 62-year streak of payout hikes is not likely to end anytime soon.', 'Nonetheless, the cost of dividend payments and share repurchases leaves Coca-Cola with little capital to invest in itself. Hence, investors should assume it will continue to underperform the S&P 500. While long-term shareholders will drive considerable returns from dividends, the stock seems to offer little to other investors.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

Many stocks offer dividends -- so which ones should you choose?"", ""I often go for those that have a track record of increasing their payments, meaning you not only can count on collecting a payment this year, but you're likely to collect even more next year and every year down the road.

The company hasn't finished gaining market share either -- quarter after quarter last year, the company won value share in the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages market."", 'All of this means Coca-Cola is a great place to park part of your $400 for the long haul.', 'Healthcare giant Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) pays a dividend of $2.20 per share at a dividend yield of 1.96%, topping the yield of the S&P 500. Like Coca-Cola, the company is a Dividend King, meaning it has a track record of rewarding shareholders, and also like the beverage giant, this company has the financial strength to keep the policy going.', ""The healthcare powerhouse generates more than $4 billion in free cash flow and has increased earnings over the years. Abbott's four businesses -- medical devices, diagnostics, nutrition, and established pharmaceuticals -- offer the company a diversification that helps it excel."", ""For example, when covid testing was booming, diagnostics led revenue gains, but these days, with testing on the decline, the company's other businesses have compensated for weakness in diagnostics. Last year, all businesses except diagnostics posted double-digit sales increases. Abbott's medical devices unit, as in years prior to the pandemic, contributed the most to overall sales thanks to top-selling products like the FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitor -- and a regular flow of new product approvals could keep this trend going."", 'So you can count on Abbott for steady earnings increases over time, thanks to its diversification and passive income growth as well.', ""Often, growth companies favor investing in their development over offering dividend payments -- so they aren't where you'll generally find passive income. But Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the exceptions."", ""The technology giant pays a dividend per share of 96 cents at a yield of 0.52%. The company doesn't have the lengthy dividend growth track record of the two companies I mentioned above, and its yield isn't the highest around -- but it does offer you the top combination of solid earnings growth potential and passive income. And that's a definite plus for your portfolio."", ""Of course, with free cash flow of $106 billion, Apple clearly can afford to pay out a dividend every year -- and at the same time invest in the innovation that keeps its success story going. A recent report from IDC shows the company last year became the worldwide smartphone leader. And Apple said in its latest earnings report its base of total installed devices has reached 2.2 billion, opening the door to even more revenue -- thanks to Apple's sales of services such as digital content and cloud storage."", ""Apple's services revenue has reached new records quarter after quarter, and its products continue to make impressive gains too -- for example, iPhone sales hit records in countries including Canada and Italy in the recent quarter."", 'An investment in Apple offers you access to this exciting technology growth story -- along with the benefits of passive income -- and that looks like a very smart way to invest part of your $400.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For instance, the price of Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) stock is up an impressive 102% over the last five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 18% gain in the last three months. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 11% in the last three months.', ""Since it's been a strong week for Waste Management shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals."", ' See our latest analysis for Waste Management ', ""To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time."", ""Over half a decade, Waste Management managed to grow its earnings per share at 5.0% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 15% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth."", 'The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).', ""It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Waste Management's earnings, revenue and cash flow."", ""As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Waste Management the TSR over the last 5 years was 120%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""It's nice to see that Waste Management shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 32% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 17% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Moving to the next page, we show how we are uniquely positioned to grow market share within the $55 billion of highly fragmented addressable markets we currently play. The combination of our product portfolio, multi-channel, multi-brand strategy, massive install base and unmatched commercial and operational footprint provides an exceptional foundation for continued market share growth, both organically and inorganically.', ""On Slide 6, we demonstrate how we remain committed to delivering financial performance, while also doing good for the planet and our community. On the left hand side of the page, we have some very exciting news to share. S&P Global recently announced that Ingersoll Rand ranked first in the world within our industry, up for number two in the prior year. Also, Ingersoll Rand was named to the A list for its performance in tackling climate change and commitment to global environment leadership by CDP. CDP annuals environmental disclosure and scoring process is globally recognized as the gold standard for corporate transparency. Finally, as shown on the right hand side of the page, we continue to make progress towards our aggressive 2030 goals, and we're already well on our way to achieve them."", 'On Slide 7, we show the catalyst for the progress, which is a highly engaged employee base combined with an ownership mindset. And as shown on the left hand side of the page, our employee satisfaction is over 600 basis points higher than the industry average. We believe our employee ownership model drives the increased employee engagement and as illustrated on the center of the page, we have created a massive economic opportunity for our employees and their families. That has been life changing for many, as expressed on the quotes from some of them. All of these leads us to the next slide, where you can see that the combination of all these factors, executed through our economic growth engine is evidence that our model provides durable long-term performance.', 'Our portfolio is positioned to capitalize on global mega trends such as sustainability, digitalization and quality of life. We expect to leverage our organic growth enablers to deliver on average mid single-digit organic growth through 2027. And as you can see, we outperformed this commitment again in 2023, delivering 10% year-over-year organic revenue growth. In 2023, we also deliver 6% of in year growth from M&A. The combined organic and inorganic growth of 16% also surpassed our low double-digit growth commitment, and not only did we surpass our growth targets, but we also exceeded our margin expansion initiatives, generating 170 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, and again, surpassing our long-term targets for this metric.', ""With IRX, as our competitive differentiator and over 400 impact daily management sessions or IDMS across our company each week, our high performance culture encourages a strong focus on execution. In 2023, we deliver adjusted EPS growth of 25% and a free cash flow margin of 18%. These results prove that we are premier durable growth compounder. On Slide 9, to date, we're on track or ahead of schedule in delivering the 2025 targets set at our previous Investor Day. We have set new aggressive targets for 2027 long-term financial and our results give us confidence in delivering those targets that are on average over the cycle. Turning to Slide 10, M&A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation strategy. We invested over $450 million across 13 acquisitions in 2023."", 'These acquisitions have been both market leading products and technologies, while accelerating our addressable market with close adjacencies. As of today, we currently have 10 transactions under LOI. Our M&A funnel remains strong and continues to be over 5x larger than it was at the time of the RMP. We expect an additional 400 to 500 basis points of annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired in 2024. The 10 transactions currently under LOI are similar in size and nature to the Bolton deals we have done over the past few years. However, outside of these 10 LOIs, we still have a couple of deals in the funnel where the purchase price exceeds $1 billion. I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q4 and full year 2023 financial performance.', 'Vik Kini : Thanks Vicente. On Slide 11, we finished the year strong in Q4 through a balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment. Total company organic orders and revenue increased 3% and 4% year-over-year respectively. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up over 8% year-over-year. This provides us with a healthy backlog to execute on entry in 2024 and gives us conviction in delivering our full year 2024 revenue guidance. The company delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $501 million, a 19% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 27.5%, 160 basis point year-over-year improvement and a hundred basis point improvements sequentially from Q3.', 'Free cash flow for the quarter was $552 million and for the year we delivered nearly $1.3 billion of free cash flow with an 18% free cash flow margin and 105% conversion to adjusted net income. Total liquidity of $3.6 billion at quarter end was up approximately $400 billion sequentially. Our net leverage continues to improve both year-over-year and sequentially. And 0.6 turns, we are 0.2 turns better than prior year and 0.3 turns better than prior quarter. Turning to Slide 12 for the total company on an FX adjusted basis, Q4 orders and revenue both grew 11%. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 19% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 260 basis points, while the PST segment margin was flat year-over-year, and corporate costs came in at $47 million for the quarter.', 'Finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 19% to $0.86 per share. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20.7% with the full year adjusted rate finishing slightly above 22%. On Slide 13, total company full year orders grew 8% and revenue increased 17%, both on an FX adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 25% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 240 basis points, while the PST segment margin increased 130 basis points. Corporate costs finished the year at $173 million, driven by continued investments to support growth in areas like demand generation and IIoT as well as the impact of incentive compensation adjustments. Lastly, adjusted EPS for the year was up 25% to $2.96 per share. Moving on to the next slide.', 'Free cash flow for the quarter was $552 million, including CapEx which totaled $30 million. Total liquidity now stands at $3.6 billion based on approximately $1.6 billion of cash and $2 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Leverage for the quarter was 0.6 turns, which was a 0.2 turn improvement year-over-year. And in 2023, we returned $295 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Specifically within the quarter, cash outflows included $130 million in share repurchases, $39 million deployed to M&A and $8 million for our dividend payment. M&A remains our top priority for capital allocation and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary use of cash, as we look ahead. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments.', 'Vicente Reynal: Thanks, Vik. On Slide 15, our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered solid year-over-year organic revenue growth of 5%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 26% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 30%, up 260 basis points from prior year with an incremental margin of 48%. We also delivered sequential margin expansion of 120 basis points from Q3 to Q4. It is important to note that we have already achieved our 2025 high 20s adjusted EBITDA margin target for ITS, which is a full two years ahead of schedule. We continue to see solid demand for our products with organic orders also up 5%. Moving to the product line highlights. Compressors were up low double-digits in orders and up mid-single-digits in revenue.', 'Industrial vacuum and blower were down low double-digits in orders, but up low double-digits in revenue. The order decline was mainly driven by prudently de-booking an order from an electric truck manufacturer in Europe that had some battery supply issues. However, the prospects are starting to look better for this manufacturer in 2024. Also, it is important to highlight that core product lines continue to show strong momentum on a two year stack, excluding FX and also excluding the recent acquisitions of SPX Air Treatment and Roots’ blower. On a two year stack, compressor orders were up mid-teens and revenue was up high 20s. Industrial vacuum and blower orders were up low double-digits and revenue was up mid-30s. As a reminder for additional detailed information on product lines and regional splits, we have moved the chart, which was previously included on this page to Slide 21 in the appendix.', ""For our innovation in action section, we're highlighting a new compressor with advanced two stage technology. This product is a great example on how Ingersoll Rand is providing an innovative digitally-enabled sustainable solution with a 17% energy efficiency improvement versus the competition. Turning to Slide 16. Organic revenue in the Precision and Science Technology segment was approximately flat year-over-year. The PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $94 million, which was up approximately 2% year-over-year with a margin of 30.1%. Organic orders were down 1.6%, driven by the Life Science businesses. We see organic orders growth stabilizing and we remain positive about the underlying health of the PST business. In fact, PST excluding the life science businesses has seen positive organic orders and revenue growth in 11 out of the last 12 quarters."", ""In addition, short cycle orders in the industrial businesses were up mid-single digits in Q4. Overall, the PST segment remains on track to meet our long-term Investor Day growth commitments. For our PST innovation in action, we're highlighting our ARO piston pump system. This is a perfect example of leveraging both i2V and demand generation to pivot an existing product line into a high growth sustainable end market. Over the past 12 months, we have already taken $7 million in orders with a leading OEM solar panel producer, which has the potential for $1 million in annualized after-market revenue. As we move to Page 17, we're introducing our 2024 guidance. Total company revenue is expected to grow between 5% to 7% with the first half growth of 4% to 6% and the second half growth of 6% to 8%."", 'We anticipate organic growth of 2% to 4%, where price is approximately 2/3 and volume 1/3. FX is expected to contribute approximately 1% of a tailwind for the year, of which the impact will be realized relatively evenly throughout the year. M&A is projected as $160 million, which reflects all completed and closed M&A transactions in 2023, as well as the acquisition Friulair. Corporate costs are planned at $160 million and are expected to be incurred evenly per quarter throughout the year. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.915 billion and $1.975 billion. At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to fall within the range of $3.14 and $3.24, which is approximately up 8% at the midpoint. We anticipate adjusted tax rate to be roughly 23%, gross interest expenses to be about $155 million and CapEx to be around 2% of revenue.', 'On the right hand side of the page, we have included a 2024 full year guidance bridge showing the growth associated with both operational activity and the impact associated with corporate cost, interest income and expenses, FX, share count and changes in the adjusted tax rate, and based on the above guidance adjusted EPS growth is expected to be 6% to 9%. As we sit here in mid-February, we would like to provide some commentary on Q1. We expect our normal seasonality to return in 2024 from a revenue perspective, which means that Q1 will be the lowest revenue quarter of the year. In addition, as a reminder, Q1 has a very tough comp as we deliver 20% organic revenue growth in Q1 of 2023. As a result, we anticipate organic revenue growth to be flattish to slightly up for a quarter with continued year-over-year margin expansion.', ""Turning to Slide 18, as we wrap up on today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in a solid position. We continue to deliver record results and both our long-term and '24 guidance is reflective of our performance to date and our increasingly durable financial profile. To employees, I want to thank you again for another excellent finish to the year. We deliver strong results by demonstrating our commitment to meeting our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine through the use of IRX. Thank you for your hard work, resiliency and focus actions. These results show the impact you each have as owners of the company. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever, and with our discipline and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with the highest return as we continue our track record of market, our performance."", ""We remain nimble, continue to monitor the dynamic market conditions and we're prepared for the challenges that may come. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open it for Q&A."", 'Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird.', ""Mike Halloran : So let's start with where you ended there on the guidance piece. Certainly appreciate all the context and help and understand the relatively normal seasonality. But maybe you could just talk to what you're embedding from an underlying assumption perspective when it comes to the broader environment, broader end markets. Is this a year where you just see relatively sequential stability? Any specific pockets you're concerned about or where you see opportunities for acceleration? Less of an Ingersoll specific question meaning. I know you have a lot of drivers that you can use to goose growth relative to whatever the end markets are doing. More of just an end market specific in an environment question."", 'See also 17 Fastest growing B2B SaaS Companies and 16 Best Beach Towns to Buy a House/Apartment in USA.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

The company's shares led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The company's trading levels have reached its high for the past year, following the recent bounce in the share price. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Vulcan Materials’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists."", ' See our latest analysis for Vulcan Materials ', ""According to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. We’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 40.54x is currently well-above the industry average of 20.54x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. Another thing to keep in mind is that Vulcan Materials’s share price is quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards the levels of its industry peers over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard for it to fall back down into an attractive buying range again."", ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price.

This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? VMC’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe VMC should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable.

If you want to skip our overview of the medical and healthcare industry, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Medical Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds. ', ""The medical and healthcare industry is one of the biggest in the world. The medical industry is assured of a steady demand for its products and services simply due to the fact that human beings are biological creatures. This means that medical stocks such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and hospital stocks such as Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC) are some of the biggest in the world. It also means that these stocks have the potential to capitalize on trends that can suddenly appear due to crises such as the coronavirus pandemic. While the fast paced nature of news cycles in the 21st century means that public focus quickly changes focus, in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic's rapid spread in 2020, investors were fretting and would have given an arm and a leg to prod the crystal ball into telling them which medical stock would be the right bet when it came to navigating the global healthcare prices."", ""As time would tell, medical stocks like Pfizer and the Cambridge, Massachusetts based biotechnology company Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) were some of the hottest due to their vaccines. During the roughly year and a half between December 2019 and September 2021, Moderna's shares appreciated by a whopping 429% on the stock market -\xa0 a result that shows that even small bets made at just the right time can yield juicy profits for investors from all walks of life. Pfizer's stock gained a more modest 50% during the same time period; but the difference between these gains is one that is understandable since Pfizer's current market capitalization of $155 billion is more than four times of Moderna's."", 'Additionally, another key difference between Moderna and Pfizer also applies to the broader categories of medical stocks that include high growth sectors such as biotechnology and somewhat more stable ones like medical device manufacturers and hospital operators. Pfizer, like its peers Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), benefits from one of the classic principles of business management, a.k.a, diversification. These medical stocks have the luxury of sizeable balance sheets that allow them to participate in markets for simple medicines that can be produced at mass scale like blood thinners, as well as medical industry segments requiring massive capital expenditure and research capabilities such as biotechnology and genetic engineering.', ""However, with genetic engineering having entered the conversation, this particular area of medicine benefits from smaller companies that are able to laser focus on being able to change the very 'code' of the human body. At the same time, while the glitzy and glamorous nature of high technology areas such as artificial intelligence means that the bulk of public and media attention remains focused on them, recent months have also seen medical stocks involved in the genomics industry make strides.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Susan Gille, Investor Relations Manager at Alliant Energy. Please go ahead."", ""Susan Gille: Good morning. I would like to thank all of you on the call and webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation. With me here today are John Larsen, Executive Chairman; Lisa Barton, President and CEO; and Robert Durian, Executive Vice President and CFO. Following prepared remarks by John, Lisa and Robert, we will have time to take questions from the investment community. We issued a news release last night announcing Alliant Energy's fourth quarter and year-end financial results. This release as well as an earnings presentation will be referenced during today's call and are available on the Investor page of our website at alliantenergy.com. Before we begin, I need to remind you that the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements."", ""These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's news release issued last night and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. In addition, this presentation contains references to non-GAAP financial measures. References to adjusted earnings exclude non-GAAP adjustments as well as net temperature impacts. The reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release which is available on our website. At this point, I'll turn the call over to John."", ""John Larsen: Thank you, Susan. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. 2023 was another successful year. Our adjusted earnings of $2.88 which excludes temperature impacts and non-GAAP adjustments, continued to deliver on our 5% to 7% long-term growth expectations. We take exceptional pride in delivering on our purpose to serve customers and build stronger communities and consistently achieving our earnings growth objectives. As we look back at 2023, I'm proud we can say, once again, we achieved EPS growth of at least 5%, our 14th straight year of delivering on that objective. We increased our dividend with 2023 marking the 20th straight year of dividend increases. We successfully executed on one of the largest capital expenditure programs in our history."", 'And as of the end of 2023, nearly 30% of our electric distribution system is underground, improving reliability and reducing operating expenses. I will now highlight a few of our many 2023 accomplishments and then turn it over to Lisa and Robert to provide details on our 2023 regulatory operating and financial results. Throughout 2023, our team demonstrated their dedication and resilience as we faced a dynamic economic environment and weather-related challenges, while also successfully advancing our customer-focused investments. We made notable progress on our generation investments. An example is the progress we made in Wisconsin on our utility scale solar projects. As of today, over 90% of our solar investments are complete and in operation and we expect to be 100% complete later this spring.', 'These strategic investments enhance customer value by providing access to zero cost fuel resources and diversify our energy mix. Also supports our local economies through new jobs and tax revenues. In addition, our wind and solar investments generate renewable tax credits that provide even more benefits to our customers. In 2023, we executed agreements to transfer those credits, improving our cash flow and providing us greater flexibility in our financing plans. Our technology investments and undergrounding efforts place Alliant Energy among the top performers for electric reliability when compared to peer U.S. utilities. Through these investments, we are better positioned to provide our customers with the high level of reliability they expect.', ""Reflecting on the past year and with my tenure as CEO concluding as of year-end 2023, I wish to express my profound pride in all our employees who consistently embody our purpose and values. Each and every day, our employees bring our purpose-driven strategy to life, serving our customers and helping to build stronger communities. I am proud to acknowledge the outstanding contributions of our engineers whose work to innovate and advance our industry will be celebrated next week during National Engineers Week. I'd like to thank our customer service team for consistently going above and beyond as they assist our customers and a sincere thank you to our dedicated crews and support staff for their unwavering commitment to excellence and for being the driving force behind our operating success."", ""In closing, I'd like to extend one more congratulations to Lisa. Her thoughtful leadership, care for the customer and industry knowledge will guide Alliant Energy into the next phase of its journey. I look forward to collaborating with her and the team for continued success in 2024. Now, I'll hand the call over to Lisa."", ""Lisa Barton: Thank you, John. I'm honored for the opportunity to build on your legacy of growth and exceptional service to the communities we are so privileged to serve. As I reflect on 2023, I am appreciative of our employees for their ongoing determination and commitment to serving our customers and strengthening our communities. I'll begin by building on John's comments about our notable progress on our generation transformation in Wisconsin, where we recently brought eight solar projects online, a huge milestone. We are currently leveraging the sun in Wisconsin to fuel nearly 900 megawatts for customers. This will increase to nearly 1.1 gigawatts this spring when our final Wisconsin solar project becomes operational. Coupled with our plans to bring 400 megawatts of solar online in Iowa this year, by year-end, nearly 1,500 of additional megawatts of the energy our customers use will be from clean, zero fuel cost energy resource."", ""In addition to our utility scale solar investments, we continue to partner with local businesses and communities interested in hosting solar projects. our customer-hosted projects help local businesses achieve their clean energy goals while community solar projects provide all customers with affordable options to participate in the solar revolution. In Cedar Rapids, our Community solar garden is fully operational and will soon be generating bill credits for all solar block purchasers. Our Janesville Solar Garden in Wisconsin now has an anchor tenant JP Cullen and construction is set to begin this spring. We have additional customer hosted projects underway and expect they'll be operational before summer. We made great progress in our clean energy transformation in 2023."", 'We retired the last coal unit at Lansing which had dutifully served our customers and communities for nearly 50 years. The retirement reduces O&M costs and advances us towards a cleaner, more efficient and cost-effective energy mix. At the same time, we continue to see the frequency and duration of outages in our service footprint steadily declined, a 20-year trend that we expect will continue as we continue focusing on improving reliability and system resilience to meet the expectations of the customers we serve. We began the process to repower the Franklin County Wind project in Iowa to increase the efficiency of our fleet. This investment will provide our customers with many more years of production tax credits. On the environmental front, we completed closure work at 29 surface impoundments across 10 sites, eliminating all Alliant Energy ash funds [ph] in Iowa and Wisconsin.', ""With these 2023 accomplishments, coupled with our planned investments in dispatchable gas generation, battery storage and wind repowering, we are well on our way of enabling a successful and responsible clean energy transition while assuring we are addressing our system resiliency needs. Looking forward, we continue to plan for the future by evolving and refining our clean energy blueprint, taking into account dynamic economic developments, evolving energy technologies and the emerging needs of the communities we serve. It is a necessary step as we look to balance our energy mix create greater grid reliability, ensure customer affordability and address MISO's resource adequacy needs. 2023 was a record year for us for economic development activities with more than 130 megawatts of announced new load across our footprint, primarily in the manufacturing sector."", ""With a capital investment of approximately $3.8 billion, these projects are expected to create more than 4,000 new local jobs. Going forward, we will continue to pursue opportunities for new customer growth at our industrial parks as we strive to build and support stronger communities. Our strong customer and community focus were contributing factors in recently being named a top utility by Business Facilities Magazine for the fourth year in a row. Alliance Energy received a number of recognitions this past year, a few of them, including ones that focus on our employees' dedication to creating a welcoming and inclusive workplace are highlighted on Slide 5. Earlier this week, we announced the retirement of Terry Kouba, President of IPL. In early March, Terry will be celebrating his 43rd year with the company and has been a thoughtful, respected and customer-focused leader of our Iowa operations."", ""We are grateful for his service and dedication to Alliant Energy, our customers, communities and employees. As we celebrate Terry's well-deserved retirement, we are advancing our succession plan by appointing May Farlinger to the position of President of IPL effective May 1. May have spent her career at Alliant Energy serving in several leadership roles. We are confident in her ability to lead our dedicated team of professionals in Iowa. As we move forward in 2024, I have every confidence we will continue to take the required actions to meet our customer needs and deliver on investor expectations. We are well positioned to quickly adapt to a dynamic environment as we execute our strategy for generating clean, reliable and affordable energy."", ""At this time, I'll turn the call over to Robert."", ""Robert Durian: Thanks, Lisa. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced 2023 adjusted earnings of $2.88 per share compared to adjusted earnings of $2.73 per share in 2022. This represents a 5.5% increase in earnings, consistent with our long-term earnings growth target of 5% to 7%. Adjusted earnings exclude the impacts of both nonrecurring adjustments and temperatures. As a reminder, we do not manage our business to offset the temporary positive or negative impacts of temperatures on sales. We manage the business to deliver long-term consistency and enable operational efficiency. Adjusted earnings year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher revenue requirements and AFUDC from capital investments, including the progress by our teams on our solar projects in Wisconsin and Iowa and lower operating and maintenance expenses at IPL and WPL resulting from our employees' focus on cost controls."", ""These positive drivers were partially offset by higher financing and depreciation expenses associated with our customer-focused capital expenditure programs. The 2023 results we are sharing today are a result of our consistent efforts to manage through and mitigate ongoing inflationary pressures. We're extremely proud that our 2023 O&M expenses were approximately $30 million less than 2022, allowing us to help offset the negative impacts on earnings from rising financing and depreciation expenses. Year-over-year sales changes in 2023 were largely impacted by temperature changes. Net temperature impacts decreased Alliant Energy's earnings by approximately $0.06 per share in 2023. In comparison, net temperatures increased Alliant Energy earnings in 2022 by $0.07 per share."", ""Temperature normalized electric sales to our retail customers were relatively flat in 2023 when compared to 2022. We experienced growth in a number of residential customers as well as higher sales from plant expansions in Wisconsin. However, these positive drivers were offset by lower electric sales to industrial customers in Iowa due to plant closures and maintenance outages. Turning to cash flows. 2023 cash flows from operations increased by almost $400 million when compared to 2022. This substantial increase was primarily due to the timing of WPL's fuel-related cost recoveries and monetization of approximately $100 million of tax credits in December. This increase resulted in a material increase in our key cash flow metrics in 2023. I'm also pleased to report that our investing cash flows in 2023, aligned with our projected capital expenditures set at the beginning of the year, due to the successful execution of our key construction projects."", 'Turning to 2024, we are positioned for another year of consistent 5% to 7% growth in adjusted earnings per share. We are affirming our 2024 earnings guidance range of $2.99 to $3.13 per share. Our efforts to support customer value by making smart investments in our future and controlling operating costs, while receiving constructive regulatory outcomes support our ability to consistently deliver solid financial results. Our financing plans for 2024 include $1.7 billion of new debt, largely to finance our investments in renewable and battery projects and support refinancing $800 million in debt maturities this year. We also expect to raise approximately $25 million in new common equity under our DRIP plan and received approximately $120 million from the sales of partial interest in West Riverside.', 'In addition, we expect to generate and transfer more than $200 million of renewable tax credits in 2024 to reduce financing needs. With the implementation of our new solar projects and the repowering of our older, vintage wind facilities, we anticipate the increased production tax credits and reduced fuel costs will help offset the impact of additional renewable rate base, rendering these new investments, cost-effective solutions for our customers. This will result in long-term benefits for our customers and long-term value for our shareowners. Our customers experience the benefits of a diverse generation portfolio in 2023 as the average retail electric rates declined for our Iowa customers due to lower fuel costs. And in Wisconsin, we ended the year in an over-collected position for fuel costs when compared to the 2023 monitoring level.', 'As a result, we plan to refund $34 million back to our Wisconsin retail electric customers in the future. We are also continuing to be well positioned to capture additional benefits for our customers from the Inflation Reduction Act and other government programs. These additional benefits include applying for lower-cost federal funding and infrastructure grants, including a grant from the DOE for long-duration energy storage in Wisconsin. We are also maximizing tax benefits by meeting tax credit added requirements and continuing the monetization of tax credits which materially improves our cash flow and credit metrics as well as reduces our future financing needs. Finally, I will highlight our regulatory initiatives in progress as well as those regulatory filings we plan to initiate in 2024.', 'We filed rate reviews in both states in 2023 and received a written order in December for the Wisconsin rate review with new rates effective January 1 of this year. And in Iowa, our electric and gas rate review is proceeding as expected with the decision anticipated in the third quarter of this year. The IUB recently finalized the procedural schedule is included on Slide 11. We have two additional pending proceedings in Wisconsin. First, we requested authority to increase the efficiency, capacity and reliability of our Neenah and Sheboygan Falls gas generating units. And second, we filed a joint application to sell an additional 125 megawatts of the West Riverside facility to WEC Energy and Madison Gas and Electric. We are anticipating decisions from the PSCW on both of these applications by the end of the second quarter.', ""Turning to our planned regulatory filings in 2024. We expect to make regulatory filings in both Iowa and Wisconsin for additional renewables and dispatchable resources following our routine, continuous modeling updates of our Clean Energy Blueprint. We expect these projects will enhance reliability, further diversify our energy resources and meet customer energy needs. We very much appreciate the continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming months. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."", 'See also 16 Best Beach Towns to Buy a House/Apartment in USA and Top 16 Aircraft Manufacturers In The World.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Companies that excel in this space tend to reward shareholders with strong returns through a wide range of selling environments, even if earnings growth is often eclipsed by other sectors when the economy is booming.', ""Costco (NASDAQ: COST) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) are respective leaders in their consumer staples niches. And while they don't compete against each other, the two businesses share similarities that make them appealing as investments. So, let's compare the two to see which could be the better buy right now."", ""Costco and Pepsi both deliver a measure of diversity that's hard to find in their market segments. Costco sells a high proportion of services and consumer discretionary products in addition to its core groceries division. For PepsiCo, its snack and food segment gives it a huge growth target beyond just sparkling beverages."", 'There\'s little separating the two companies when it comes to their reported growth rates. In early February, Costco revealed that comparable-store sales were up 5% in the past few months. Pepsi announced at around the same time that it is expecting organic sales to rise by ""at least 4%"" in the 2024 fiscal year.', ""Yet Costco still has the edge in this key metric. The chain posted a healthy 4% customer traffic boost in the most recent quarter, and sales growth accelerated into early 2024. Pepsi, on the other hand, is seeing declining sales volumes. Management warned investors that revenue trends are slowing down due to a combination of reduced inflation and weaker demand. Costco's momentum is much more positive as a result."", ""Investors who prioritize earnings power will find more to like about Pepsi stock today. Sure, the company isn't nearly as profitable as its key rival, Coca-Cola. But Pepsi still converts a respectable 13% of sales into operating profit compared to Costco's 3% rate. Pepsi is boosting that figure, too, with help from cost savings and this past year's price increases. Conversely, Costco's margin tends to hold steady at that 3% level whether its sales are booming or not."", ""The beverage giant also delivers more predictably rising cash returns to shareholders. After spending $8 billion in each of the past two years on dividends and stock buybacks, management hiked the dividend in February by 7%, equating to a nearly 3% yield. Costco commits to a much smaller payout (yielding 0.6% right now) and isn't nearly as aggressive, or predictable, with its dividend raises. Count this as a win in Pepsi's column."", ""The strongest business won't be the right investment if the price is too high. That's a bigger risk with Costco than with Pepsi at the moment. You'll pay 1.3 times sales for this stock right now, which is near a 10-year high. Costco is also very expensive compared to peers like Target and Walmart. Pepsi, meanwhile, is priced at a discount to Coca-Cola and its price-to-sales ratio of 2.5 is right within the range that investors have seen in the past few years."", ""Investors must balance that discount against Pepsi's weaker growth outlook. Still, the beverage giant's strong earnings and cash returns ultimately make it more attractive than pricey Costco stock right now, especially if you're a fan of lower-risk investments."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and PepsiCo wasn’t one of them.

Last week, PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) announced it was increasing its dividend, just as it has dozens of times as part of its yearly fourth-quarter earnings update. The payout hike marked the 52nd consecutive annual boost for the beverage and snack giant, in fact.', ""There will be more payout increases ahead for this dominant business. But the higher dividend reflected both good and bad news about its recent operating trends. Here's what investors need to know about Pepsi's new quarterly cash payout."", ""Pepsi raised its annual dividend by 7% to $5.42 per share, which translates into a 3.2% forward yield. As generous as that hike might sound, it's a slowdown compared to last year, when management issued a 10% raise to shareholders."", ""Investors don't have to hunt for reasons why Pepsi is feeling a bit stingier here in early 2024. Management said that industry demand growth is slowing and that sales trends will be further pressured by the expected end of inflation-based price increases."", ""Volume was down 3% in the most recent quarter, too, meaning growth came entirely from rising prices through most of the year. These negative factors all help explain why Pepsi is projecting an organic sales uptick of 4% in 2024, or less than half of this past year's boost."", ""There's more uniformly positive news around Pepsi's finances. The company generated $13 billion of operating cash this past year, up from $11 billion in 2022. Cost cuts are helping lift this metric, but so are those price increases that have combined with a recent slowdown in raw material inflation."", ""In other words, while margins were squeezed in late 2022 and early 2023 when inflation kicked into high gear, the opposite is occurring today. Pepsi is projecting that earnings will rise at an 8% rate this year, or roughly double the pace of sales increases expected in 2024. That's likely a big factor behind the generous dividend boost that Pepsi just announced."", ""PepsiCo's stock entered the year trading at a reasonable price, and its discount has only become more attractive in recent months. You'll have to pay 2.5 times sales for this consumer staples business, down from 2023 highs of over 3 times sales. Toss in a 3%-plus dividend yield, and you have several factors that could support excellent returns for patient shareholders."", 'Risk-averse investors might want to watch the stock for signs that PepsiCo can continue growing sales without the help of significant price increases in 2024 and beyond. Management warned that demand trends are slowing back down to pre-pandemic levels, after all, in part because inflation-based price boosts are done providing their sales lifts.', 'On the other hand, the stock has a chance to rally as profit margin improves, potentially laying the groundwork for big earnings growth (and a more rapidly expanding dividend) beginning in 2025.', ""Sure, Pepsi likely won't deliver the nearly double-digit sales growth that investors saw through most of the last three years. But earnings and cash flow are strong, and organic sales are still rising at a healthy pace. That's why investors can expect this dividend to keep growing, even if the stock price stays volatile into 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and PepsiCo wasn’t one of them.

Eylea is also approved for a variety of ailments including diabetic retinopathy and wet age-related macular degeneration.', 'Exclusivity for existing Dupixent patents continues until the beginning of the next decade, but approval for new indications could extend the revenue potential of this drug even longer. For example, Regeneron is currently seeking approval for Dupixent as a treatment for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and type 2 inflammation.', 'COPD patients with type 2 inflammation represent 20% to 40% of the entire COPD patient population. Label expansion of Dupixent for this disease would open up a new addressable market of about 300,000 people.', 'COPD affects about 12 million patients in the U.S. alone. Last year, Evercore analyst Josh Schimmer wrote in a note that adding COPD as an approved indication for Dupixent could propel sales of this drug to more than $20 billion annually by the end of the decade.', ""And while Eylea was scheduled to lose patent exclusivity last year, Regeneron's filing of multiple ancillary product patents meant that its last patent now won't expire until 2040."", 'Dupixent drove total global sales of $12 billion in 2023, up 33% from 2022. Meanwhile, Eylea had U.S. product sales of $5.7 billion in the 12-month period. Eylea HD, the higher-dose version of the drug approved last year, brought in sales of $166 million in the U.S. last year.', ""Looking at Regeneron's financial performance for 2023, it had $13 billion on the top line, and $4 billion on the bottom line. While that net income figure was down a single-digit percentage year-over-year, revenue was up 8% from one year ago."", ""Another driver of Regeneron's 2023 performance was cancer drug Libtayo, also developed in partnership with Sanofi. Libtayo had $869 million in global sales in 2023, a 50% increase from the prior year."", ""This biotech's shares earned a total return of about 133% over the trailing-five-year period, about 30% higher than the S&P 500's return in that same time frame. Regeneron isn't a lightning growth stock. But its steady returns, continued profitability, and overall promise of its current and potential products make it a no-brainer buy for long-term healthcare investors."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
