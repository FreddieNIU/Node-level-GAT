The rule would also lower exchange access fees.The regulator will also consider whether to strengthen an existing rule requiring brokers to provide information on the quality of their customer trade executions.WHO WOULD BE IMPACTED BY THE CHANGES?Story continuesThe order competition rule, which would require marketable retail orders to be sent to auctions, could lead to more such orders being matched on exchanges, like the Nasdaq or Intercontinental Exchange Inc's New York Stock Exchange, rather than by wholesale brokers, like Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial.The NYSE and Nasdaq and Citadel Securities declined to comment.Virtu recently sued the SEC over the lack of response to a public information request by the company over who the regulator was meeting with and what data it was looking at while the new rules were being drafted.The proposed order competition rule could also dent the profits of retail brokers, like Charles Schwab Corp and Robinhood Markets Inc, that take payments from wholesale brokers in exchange for their customer orders.Schwab declined to comment and Robinhood did not respond to a request for comment.The proposal to allow exchanges to display sub-penny prices could allow exchanges to better compete with broker-run trading venues, which at times execute nearly half of U.S. stock volume. Lowering exchange access fees could also make exchanges more attractive places to execute trades, but it would also reduce the ability for exchanges to offer rebates to win order flow.The new best execution standard for brokers could also impact payments to retail brokers from wholesalers and exchanges for order flow.WHEN WOULD THE CHANGES GO INTO EFFECT?The SEC rulemaking process can take years. If the rule proposals are passed, they will be put out for public comment, typically for 30 to 60 days, and then the SEC will consider the comments as it drafts the final rules.The last major shakeup of the markets was Regulation National Market System, adopted in June 2005 but which did not come into law until 2007.The SEC declined additional comment.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Texas InstrumentsOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman, Richard Templeton, for US$5.9m worth of shares, at about US$178 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$176. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.In the last year Texas Instruments insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Texas Instruments Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Texas Instruments. In total, Senior VP &amp; CTO Ahmad R. S. Bahai sold US$200k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Texas Instruments insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$173m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Texas Instruments Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Texas Instruments makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. To help with this, we've discovered 3 warning signs (2 are significant!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in Texas Instruments.But note: Texas Instruments may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

If you want to read about some more aluminum companies, go directly to 5 Biggest Aluminum Companies In The World.Aluminum is one of the most abundant metallic elements in the Earth’s crust. It possesses many properties, being durable, malleable, strong, lightweight, flexible, and resistant to corrosion and oxidation. It also has high reflectivity and excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. It is widely used in the manufacturing of many important automobile parts, like wheels, engines, chassis, and other parts of modern cars. Globally, it is also used to produce smartphones, tablets, personal computers (PCs), refrigerators, and other electronic items.The market growth in the aluminum sector can be attributed to the extensive use of the metal in different industries across the globe. For instance, in addition to being important for electronics and cars, it is employed in the food and beverage industry for making packaging containers, in the cosmetics industry for packing and protecting cosmetic products, in the production of different dosage forms of medications, including capsules, creams, lotions, liquid, and powders, and other pharma products. The aluminum market, like other sectors of the economy, was severely affected by the COVID-19 crisis. However, since then, demand for cars and electronics have skyrocketed. The aluminum industry has not taken full advantage of this rise in demand since the onset of inflation following the market recovery has resulted in a shortage of workers in the manufacturing sectors, in tandem with a fall in demand from the aerospace and automotive industries. The rising consumption of packaged foods is offsetting this to some extent. Despite the near-term headwinds, it is expected that the aluminum market will rise in the coming years. Conservative estimates of the aluminum market size before the end of this decade place it around $277 billion, predicting a compound annual growth rate of more than 5.6%. Some of the top firms working in the aluminum sector include Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), among others discussed in detail below. Story continuesOur MethodologyThese were picked from a careful assessment of the aluminum industry. The details of each aluminum company are mentioned alongside a discussion around top firms in the sector in order to provide readers with some context for their investment decisions. 15 Biggest Aluminum Companies In The WorldPixabay/Public DomainBiggest Aluminum Companies In The World15.

The current price of aluminum is unsustainably low, below its cost of production, despite inventories being at historic lows. We believe these depressed prices are due to the evaporation of Chinese demand resulting from its zero COVID-19 policy, but that it will likely recover over the next few quarters.Additionally, Alcoa is leading the industry in reducing carbon emissions from its smelting process which is helping to improve its cost position relative to global competitors.

Nucor expects fourth quarter earnings to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share. Nucor reported net earnings of $6.50 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2022 and $7.97 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Full year earnings for 2022 remains on track to exceed the record of $23.16 per diluted share Nucor set in 2021.Included in the expected fourth quarter earnings range is an approximately $58 million net benefit, or $0.22 per diluted share, related to state tax credits.In the steel mills segment, we expect considerably lower earnings in the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to the third quarter of 2022 due to lower average selling prices, margin compression and lower volumes, with the largest decrease in profitability expected at our sheet mills. Shipments for our bar mills are expected to be lower due to seasonal factors with customers reducing inventories as year-end approaches.The steel products segment is expected to have strong earnings in the fourth quarter of 2022, but we expect the segment's earnings to decline moderately from the third quarter of 2022 on lower volumes and selling prices.  While we believe these trends are mainly seasonal effects, economic uncertainty and recession concerns could impact future demand.The raw materials segment is expected to have significantly decreased earnings in the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to the third quarter of 2022 due to decreased profitability of our DRI facilities, both of which experienced planned outages during the fourth quarter, and decreased selling prices for raw materials.During the fourth quarter, Nucor has repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares at an average price of $130.30 per share (approximately 20.6 million shares year-to-date at an average price of $134.29 per share). Nucor has returned approximately $3.3 billion to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments year-to-date.Story continuesAbout NucorNucor and its affiliates are manufacturers of steel and steel products, with operating facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

This retail REIT holds the trademark of the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company.”In September, Realty Income raised its dividend to 24.80 cents per share from the 24.75 cents paid out earlier. The increased dividend was paid out on Oct 14 to shareholders on record as of Oct 3, 2022.Though the latest hike marks a marginal increase from the prior dividend, the January payout will be the company’s 630th consecutive monthly dividend payout in its 53-year operating history.

The company will now pay out $1.40 per share, which reflects a hike of 12% from the prior dividend of $1.25.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $5.60 per share, denoting an increase of 60 cents per share from the prior dividend level. At this new rate, the annualized yield comes at 3.38%, based on the stock’s closing price of $165.63 on Dec 13. The new dividend will be paid out on Jan 31, 2023 to shareholders of record as of Jan 13, 2023.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and MAA remains committed to that. The company has a good track record of paying out dividends to its shareholders.The recent hike reflects MAA’s ability to generate solid income through its operating platform and high-quality portfolio. MAA has delivered 13 years of consecutive dividend increases.In May 2022, the company announced a common stock cash dividend of $1.25 per share, marking a 15% hike over the prior payment. Based on the dividends paid out over the trailing four quarters, MAA’s dividend yield is 3.02%.The company increased its dividend six times in the past five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 4.95%. Check Mid-America Apartment’s dividend history here.In addition, with the expected 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share growth of 20.68%, ahead of the industry’s average of 12.05%, the increased dividend is likely to be sustainable.MAA maintains a well-balanced, diverse portfolio across the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States. The portfolio is diversified in terms of markets, submarkets, product types and price points. This diversification shields the company from an economic downturn in any particular market, choppiness in any product type or assets belonging to specific price points and helps generate a consistent revenue stream.MAA’s diversified Sunbelt portfolio of suburban-focused communities was less severely affected by the pandemic and the economic shutdown. The pandemic accelerated employment shifts and population inflow into the company’s markets as renters sought more business-friendly, lower-taxed and low-density cities. These favorable longer-term secular dynamic trends are increasing the desirability of its markets. Amid these, MAA is poised to capture recovery in demand and leasing compared with expensive coastal markets.MAA’s current cash flow growth is projected at 39.17% compared with the 14.86% growth projected for the industry. Moreover, this REIT’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) highlights its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 10.60% compares favorably with the industry’s 4.78%, reflecting that MAA is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.Given its balance sheet strength and prudent financial management, the company is well-poised to capitalize on growth opportunities and reward shareholders efficiently. Moreover, looking at its lower dividend payout (compared to its industry), it seems that its dividend distribution is expected to be sustainable.So far in the quarter, shares of Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) MAA have rallied 6.8% against the industry’s decline of 1.1%.

Among these, the most popular are the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-sales ratio (P/S). However, investors often overlook the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), which though used less often, is an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with great returns.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Celestica, Signet Jewelers, Unum Group, Aercap and Sterling Infrastructure are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Celestica is one of the largest electronics manufacturing services companies in the world, serving the computer and communications sectors.Celestica has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of A.

14,b3a1e9b6-3a56-377c-bd9f-4d0eb1d81234,QRVO,2022-12-15,Exclusive-The global supply trail that leads to Russia’s killer drones,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-global-supply-trail-leads-120258942.html,1671105778,STORY,['QRVO'],"[By Stephen Grey, Maurice Tamman and Maria Zholobova(Reuters) - The hundreds of Russian drones hovering ominously over the Ukrainian battlefield owe their existence to an elastic, sanctions-evading supply chain that often runs through a shabby office above a Hong Kong marketplace, and sometimes through a yellow stucco home in suburban Florida.The ""Sea Eagle"" Orlan 10 UAV is a deceptive, relatively low-tech and cheap killer that has directed many of the up to 20,000 artillery shells that Russia has fired daily on Ukrainian positions in 2022, killing up to 100 soldiers per day, according to Ukrainian commanders.An investigation by Reuters and iStories, a Russian media outlet, in collaboration with the Royal United Services Institute, a defence think tank in London, has uncovered a logistical trail that spans the globe and ends at the Orlan's production line, the Special Technology Centre in St. Petersburg, Russia.Based on Russian customs filings and bank records, the investigation marks the first time a supply route for American technology has been traced all the way to a Russian manufacturer, whose weapon system is used in Ukraine.The Special Technology Centre, which once made a variety of surveillance gadgets for the Russian government and now focuses on drones for the military, was first targeted by U.S. sanctions after President Barack Obama said it had worked with Russian military intelligence to try to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.The sanctions, which took effect in 2017, barred any American citizen or resident or U.S. company from supplying anything that might end up with the Special Technology Centre. In March of this year, the U.S. government tightened those restrictions by blocking all sales of any American products for any military end user, and effectively blocked all sales to Russia of high-technology items like microchips, communications and navigation equipment.None of that has stopped the production of the Orlan drone.Story continuesThe Special Technology Centre did not respond to a written request for comment. But one top scientist, who is also a major shareholder, said in an interview with Reuters that the company was experiencing a ""high demand"" for its drones.Russia's Ministry of Defence did not respond to questions from Reuters about the impact of sanctions and its relationship to the Special Technology Centre.The U.S. Department of Commerce, which enforces controls on the export of US technology, would not comment on its knowledge of the Special Technology Centre, or of U.S. parts supplying Russia's drone program.In a statement to Reuters, a Commerce spokesperson said the department cannot comment on the existence or non-existence of investigations. The spokesperson added: ""We will not hesitate to use all the tools at our disposal to obstruct the efforts of those who seek to support Putin's war machine.""Among the most important suppliers to Russia's drone program has been a Hong Kong-based exporter, Asia Pacific Links Ltd, which, according to Russian customs and financial records, provided millions of dollars in parts, though never directly. Many of the parts are microchips from U.S. manufacturers.Asia Pacific's exports to Russia were primarily delivered to one importer in St. Petersburg with close ties to the Special Technology Centre, those customs records show. The import company, SMT iLogic, shares an address with the drone maker and has numerous other connections.Asia Pacific's owner, Anton Trofimov, is an expatriate Russian who graduated from a Chinese university and has other business interests in China as well as a company in Toronto, Canada, according to his LinkedIn profile and other corporate filings.According to public records, Trofimov is a resident of a modest East York neighborhood of Toronto. He did not respond to questions sent by email and LinkedIn. A woman who answered the door identified herself as Trofimov's wife and said she would pass along a message for him to contact Reuters. He never did.The neighborhood is a world away from Asia Pacific's office in a shabby and narrow office building off a side alley and pedestrian market in Hong Kong's business district.No one was at the Hong Kong office when a Reuters journalist visited recently. The company shares a partitioned room with three other tenants, according to the building's receptionist.Despite appearances, business has boomed this year. In the seven months between March 1 and September 30, since Russia's February invasion, Asia Pacific increased its business sharply, exporting parts valued at about $5.2 million, up from about $2.3 million in the same period of 2021, making it iLogic's biggest supplier, according to Russian customs records. Many of the components were made by U.S. tech firms, the records also show.Among the parts sent by Asia Pacific to iLogic in the same period of 2022 were $1.8 million of chips made by Analog Devices, $641,000 made by Texas Instruments, and $238,000 by Xilinx, according to the Russian customs data. The supplies also included model aircraft engines made by a Japanese company, Saito Seisakusho, that are used in the Orlan 10, as shown in photos of drones recovered in Ukraine. Saito said it was unaware of the shipments.Asked about the shipments to Russia in recent months, Analog Devices didn't reply to emailed questions. Texas Instruments and AMD, the owner of Xilinx, said their companies had not directly shipped or approved shipments into Russia for many months and were complying with all U.S. sanctions and export controls.AMD added that it requires its authorized distributors to implement end-use screening measures to track the potential sale or diversion of AMD products into Russia or restricted regions. ""SMT iLogic and Asia Pacific Links are not authorized AMD distributors,"" AMD said.THE SUPPLIER NEXT DOORFinancial records provided by a Russian official and reviewed by Reuters show the Special Technology Centre relies on a number of suppliers, but most notably iLogic. According to a record of iLogic's own bank receipts and payments seen by Reuters, iLogic works almost exclusively for the drone maker.Since 2017, iLogic has imported about $70 million of mostly electronic products into Russia, according to customs records. And according to financial documents examined by iStories and Reuters, nearly 80% of the company's income is from its business with the Special Technology Centre.In turn, those same financial records show the Special Technology Centre's biggest customer is Russia's Ministry of Defence, which paid it nearly 6 billion rubles ($99 million) between February and August of this year. The examined records list all transfers to and from the company's bank accounts during that period.Reached by phone, Alexey Terentyev, a top scientist and major shareholder at the Special Technology Centre, said the war has forced it to focus on making drones.""Due to the high demand for Orlans, we do not have the resources to do something else now. The demand for it is much bigger than we can produce,"" he said.U.S. sanctions had caused the company problems, he said, but it always found someone in the world to sell it what it needed. ""Sanctions were imposed on us by one of the most powerful countries in the world,"" Terentyev said. ""We should be proud of this.""Terentyev declined to say if iLogic was one of those suppliers. Asked about iLogic, he said, ""You ask me about a company I don't know."" Reminded that he was listed as one of iLogic's founders in Russian corporate records, he said that if his name showed up in documents, it was ""likely correct"" he was a shareholder. ""Yes, I remember something,"" he said. But he could not recall what iLogic did. ""I have lost connection with this company,"" he said.Those corporate records show iLogic is based at the same St Petersburg office address as the Special Technology Centre. Russian corporate records show it was founded by Terentyev and other senior executives of the drone maker or their relatives.In a brief telephone interview, Roman Agafonnikov, chief executive officer of the Special Technology Centre, said he didn't know anything about iLogic.FLORIDAOn the coast of southeast Florida, living in a smart suburban house just behind a nature reserve, is another individual who has supplied Russia's drone program.Igor Kazhdan, a 41-year-old U.S.-Russian citizen, owns a company, IK Tech, that sold about $2.2 million worth of electronics to Russia between 2018 and 2021, Russian customs records show, over 90% of which were sold to iLogic.Russian custom records show that IK Tech sold iLogic about 1,000 American-made circuit boards between October 2020 and October 2021, at a time when federal law banned the supply, whether directly or via another company, of any such technology to the Special Technology Centre.The boards, valued at about $274,000, were made by a California manufacturer, Gumstix. The California company told Reuters it is ""very concerned"" to hear of the shipments and would investigate. It said it does not have customers located in Russia nor any products or services intended for Russia, adding, ""We will take all appropriate action to address any identified diversion of products from lawful end use.""Photos taken by Ukraine officials of the inside of a captured drone and seen by Reuters show a Gumstix board that is almost identical to the boards shipped by IK Tech. According to a list of components found on another drone supplied to RUSI and Reuters by the Ukrainian government, the board is part of the Orlan 10's control unit.Kazhdan's activities drew the attention of U.S. authorities. Just two weeks before Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine and Orlan drones started buzzing overhead, federal agents arrested Kazhdan. He was later indicted on 13 counts of smuggling and evading export controls when selling electronic components to Russia between December 2021 and February 2022.The indictment related to selling sophisticated amplifiers made by U.S.-based Qorvo that required an export license for Russia. It is not clear from court documents if U.S. authorities were aware of the ultimate destination of the products. The Qorvo amplifiers, which are often used in radar, communications and radio equipment, have been found in the radio communication circuits of Orlan drones, according to Ukrainian officials. In a statement to Reuters, Qorvo said the ""declared destination"" of the parts mentioned in the case was a distributor in Florida. It added: ""Qorvo has never conducted business or had any relationship with IK Tech or Igor Kazhdan, and the Company's products were exported and used without our knowledge.""In November 2022, after Kazhdan pleaded guilty to two charges, a federal judge sentenced him to three years of probation, fined him $200 and ordered him to forfeit about $7,000. If convicted on all counts, Kazhdan could have faced 40 years in prison.Speaking on the doorstep of his Dania Beach, Florida, home, Kazhdan, wearing a scruffy beard in shorts and short-sleeve shirt, said the scale of his exports to Russia was minimal compared to other companies when it was put to him that he may have been assisting Russia's drone program.""I just don't think that whatever this is, it's a big deal that you should be writing this story,"" Kazhdan said. ""This is just comical.""Beyond that, he would not speak about the case or his shipments to Russia.At his November 2022 sentencing hearing, Kazhdan told the Southern Florida District judge that he started doing business with Russia after making contact with importers at a 2016 satellite conference. Soon after, the importers convinced him to skirt reporting and licensing requirements, he said.The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment on the case.((This article was reported by Stephen Grey in London, Maurice Tamman in New York and Florida and by Maria Zholobova, a reporter for iStories; Additional reporting by James Pomfret in Hong Kong and Anna Mehler Paperny in Toronto; editing by Janet McBride))]"

However, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 6.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for Cintas’ fiscal second quarter.Cintas Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCintas Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCintas Corporation price-eps-surprise | Cintas Corporation QuoteFactors to NoteStrong volumes and higher prices are likely to have driven performance of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment revenues for the  fiscal second quarter indicates a 9.1% increase from the year-ago reported number.Strength across the first aid cabinet service business is expected to have boosted the First Aid and Safety Services segment’s revenues. The consensus mark for First Aid and Safety Services segment revenues hints at a 9.9% rise from the year-ago reported number.Strong growth across the uniform direct sale and fire protection services businesses is also likely to have driven CTAS’ fiscal second-quarter performance.

You can skip our detailed analysis of corporate political orientations in the US and go directly to 5 Most Conservative Companies in USA. Corporate America has traditionally been politically oriented largely towards the Republican Party given their fiscally conservative values. According to results from a Harvard Law School study cited by S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), over 60% of CEOs of S&amp;P 1500 companies contributed more money to the GOP than to the Democratic party between the studied period of 2000-2017.In terms of industry, companies doing business in energy, manufacturing and chemicals leaned more towards Republicans than companies in tech, finance, and telecommunications industries. To take the example of the energy sector, 88.7% of companies’ CEOs donated to the GOP.  Most companies that leaned towards the GOP were based in the Midwest and the South. Additionally, male CEOs were more likely to donate to Republicans than female CEOs. However, big business, especially sectors like technology, are more and more leaning towards the Democrats for several reasons for quite some time. Some latest policy changes and new laws in the US are also increasing the popularity of the Democrats among corporate America.For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act passed on August 12, with a budget of $370 billion, aims to incentivize clean energy technologies for the next 10 years. This will include tax breaks and carbon credits for renewable energy companies as well as subsidies for a maximum of $85 per metric ton of carbon capture for companies developing carbon capture technologies. Such democratic policies in the past have greatly helped companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR). For instance, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has received a total of $3.2 billion since 2009 in various subsidies like tax breaks and carbon credits from the state of California. Story continuesPhoto by Saketh Garuda on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of 15 most conservative companies in the USA, we’ve ranked companies based on the percentage of their 2022 election cycle donations that went to the Republican congressional candidates. We’ve sourced the data from Open Secrets, a non-profit organization that tracks corporate campaign-financing and lobbying.Let’s now move to the 15 most conservative companies in USA. 15. Hobby Lobby StoresPercentage of Donations to Republicans in 2022: 64.20%Hobby Lobby Stores is an American arts and crafts retailer. The company has 969 stores across 47 states in the US.

It is one of the reasons the company leans right, as democratic economic policies often incentivize environmentally friendly companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) while increasing oil royalty rates.11. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) Percentage of Donations to Republicans in 2022: 73.39%ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is a major energy company based in Houston, Texas.

(NASDAQ:TSLA), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) are in the same sector of energy but unlike Chevron, these companies are working in clean energy technologies. 8.

Sainsbury PLC (JSAIY) or Walmart (WMT). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, J. Sainsbury PLC has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Walmart has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that JSAIY's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.JSAIY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.21, while WMT has a forward P/E of 24.27.

WMT currently has a PEG ratio of 4.41.Another notable valuation metric for JSAIY is its P/B ratio of 0.65. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. Long term Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. (NYSE:MMC) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 114% in five years. On top of that, the share price is up 10% in about a quarter.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies managed to grow its earnings per share at 13% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 16% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This free interactive report on Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies' balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies the TSR over the last 5 years was 132%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 2.8% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 18% a year, is even better. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

This specialist retail insurance broker provides services to aviation and aerospace clients across the country. Adding these entities will enhance the acquirer’s compelling aviation portfolio and consolidate its presence in the region. The buyout will also support cross-selling opportunities in Australia for this world-leading insurance broker.AJG’s revenues are geographically diversified with strong domestic and international operations, with the latter contributing about one-third of revenues and spread across Australia, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The company expects international contribution to total revenues to increase, given the number and size of the non-U.S. acquisitions.Arthur J. Gallagher boasts an impressive inorganic story. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has made 11 buyouts in the fourth quarter of 2022 so far while closing 19 new tuck-in brokerage mergers, representing about $107 million of estimated annualized revenues in the first nine months of 2022. AJG has a strong merger and acquisition pipeline with about $400 million of revenues, associated with about 50 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared.A solid capital position supports AJG in its growth initiatives and it thus remains focused on continuing its tuck-in mergers and acquisitions. The company expects M&amp;A capacity at more than $4 billion through the end of 2023.This insurance broker remains focused on long-term growth strategies for delivering organic revenue improvement and pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions. AJG is focused on productivity improvements and quality enhancements that should help it post sturdy numbers in the future.  Shares of Arthur J. Gallagher have gained 14.2% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 1.2% increase.

36,d54bfc0e-ec27-38d4-8364-d9dfe3480ab9,XYL,2022-12-15,Investors Met With Slowing Returns on Capital At Xylem (NYSE:XYL),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-met-slowing-returns-capital-101608320.html,1671099368,STORY,['XYL'],"[Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Although, when we looked at Xylem (NYSE:XYL), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Xylem:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.094 = US$579m ÷ (US$8.1b - US$1.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Xylem has an ROCE of 9.4%.  On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 11% average generated by the Machinery industry. See our latest analysis for Xylem roceIn the above chart we have measured Xylem's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Xylem.What Can We Tell From Xylem's ROCE Trend?Things have been pretty stable at Xylem, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So unless we see a substantial change at Xylem in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. This probably explains why Xylem is paying out 34% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesIn Conclusion...We can conclude that in regards to Xylem's returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. Since the stock has gained an impressive 80% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.If you want to continue researching Xylem, you might be interested to know about the 2 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.While Xylem may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Microchip Technology How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Microchip Technology is:30% = US$1.8b ÷ US$6.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.30 in profit.Does Microchip Technology Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Microchip Technology has a higher ROE than the average (19%) in the Semiconductor industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Microchip Technology by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesMicrochip Technology's Debt And Its 30% ROEMicrochip Technology clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.20. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

45,ab6a353e-76f9-3f15-b1c1-e17b76c07d56,MET,2022-12-15,10 Stocks Most Affected by Inflation,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-stocks-most-affected-inflation-192014284.html,1671045614,STORY,"['BYND', 'COIN', 'TSCO', 'WHR', 'PG', 'MET-PE']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 10 stocks most affected by inflation. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Stocks Most Affected by Inflation.Inflation in the US is hovering around a four-decade high, and this has caused experts to investigate its impact on different corporations. The first takeaway is that companies that are cyclical in nature and can pass on price increases to customers can safeguard their margins during periods of raging inflation. As a result, they experience growth and expansion during inflationary periods. On the other hand, companies that are carrying high levels of debt and are sensitive to interest rate changes come under pressure. This is because, during periods of high inflation, it is a common practice to increase benchmark interest rates to bring inflation under control, which leads to highly leveraged entities incurring increased financing costs. According to the financial services firm Allianz, sectors like consumer staples and utilities have had an inverse correlation with inflation rates as these businesses utilize resources that raise the cost of their inputs. In general, this has had a negative impact on their stock prices and margins. In contrast, businesses in the materials and energy industries traditionally have had a positive correlation with inflation. Inflation also causes challenges for technology companies undergoing the growth phase. However, the decline for technology companies has been much softer as compared to the dot com bubble burst in the early 2000s.Inflation was a key topic during the Q3 2022 earnings season as well as it was discussed by the majority of the companies during their conference calls. Depending on the nature of the businesses, companies were impacted differently by inflation. Numerous leading companies were able to surpass consensus top-line and bottom-line expectations for Q3 2022 as they were able to pass the price increases on to the customers and control their cost structure, despite experiencing a decline in unit sales. In contrast, companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) observed rising raw material costs, resulting in a contraction in margins. As of November, inflation grew by 7.7% YoY in the US as opposed to the Federal Reserve’s long-term target of 2% only.Story continues10 Stocks Most Affected by InflationOur MethodologyWe have analyzed the earnings reports, analyst ratings, and growth prospects of the companies to shortlist the 10 stocks most affected by inflation. While some of these companies have strong fundamentals, the raging inflation has had a strong negative impact on their operations and financial strength. We have ranked these stocks in terms of the level of hedge fund ownership as of Q3 2022.10 Stocks Most Affected by Inflation10. Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) is a Los Angeles, California-based producer of plant-based meat alternatives for the vegan community.The company, founded in 2009, has come under intense pressure due to declining demand for its products. The decline in demand has caused Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) to cut its revenue guidance for FY22. Furthermore, the company has been forced to lay off 200 employees to control its costs. On December 9, Kristina Ruggeri at Argus downgraded Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) stock from a Hold to a Sell rating as the analyst observed a diminishing demand due to high inflation. The analyst also observed that the rise in prices is causing customers to trade down to more economical choices. Ms. Ruggeri added that Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) has also been adversely impacted by an increase in competition as other players have emerged in the plant-based meat substitute industry.Here's what Horos Asset Management said about Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“What about the other asset class that has attracted the most attention from the investment community in recent times? Beyond Meat is the other company whose valuations we did not understand and whose share price has also declined drastically in the last year and a half.”9. Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) is a Benton Harbor, Michigan-based producer and seller of home appliances products.Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) observed a major dent in the consumption of its products during Q3 2022 due to high inflation. This caused the company to miss the top-line and bottom-line estimates for the quarter. Furthermore, Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) has forecasted a period of softer demand moving forward, as increasing inflation is expected to have an impact on the consumers' budgets in 2023 as well.In a research note issued to investors on October 26, Elizabeth Suzuki at Bank of America downgraded Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) stock from a Neutral to an Underperform rating with a target price of $119 as opposed to the previous target price of $156. The revised target price represents a potential downside of over 17% from the closing price of December 13. The analyst observed that the company data reflects that there has been a significant decline in the sale of appliances.8. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) is an operator of cryptocurrency exchanges that have been severely impacted by rising inflation.The price of the two notable cryptocurrencies in the form of Bitcoin and Ethereum have lost nearly 60% of their value YTD. The sharp decline has led investors to bear heavy losses and liquidate their positions in the cryptocurrency universe. The sentiments of cryptocurrency investors are expected to remain depressed next year and in 2024 as well.Based on these developments, Dan Dolev at Mizuho downgraded Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) stock from a Neutral to an Underperform rating on December 9. The analyst also reduced the target price by more than 28% from $42 to $30. The reduced target price is 25% lower than the last closing price of December 13. The significant downward revision in target price has been due to Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) slashing the revenue and EBITDA forecast for 2024 by 18% and 64%, respectively.Here's what Hayden Capital said about Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN): The crypto ecosystem moves extremely quickly, and there’s been many new developments since we first invested in Coinbase, a year ago. Most notably, crypto market cap has declined from a peak of ~$3 Trillion last fall, to ~$1.1 Trillion today (a -63% decline, and -72% peak-to-trough; LINK). Crypto is a volatile asset class, and has experienced many draw-downs of similar magnitude in the past. For example, Bitcoin was down -93% during 2011, -85% from 2013-15, and -84% from 2017-18. In this context, the latest draw-down is a pretty normal outcome for this emerging asset class.A large reason for this volatility, is simply because there aren’t any major “real-world use cases” for the asset just yet. In our letter outlining the investment last year, we wrote that crypto is still “in the middle of ‘crossing the chasm’ into mainstream adoption &amp; use cases, which will result in millions of mainstream users needing to transact crypto in some form”…” (Click here to see the full text)7. MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) is a New York-based provider of annuities, employee benefit programs, and insurance services. The company, founded in 1868, has a presence in over 60 countries with 90 million customers and has the distinction of being one of the biggest players in its industry.The rising inflation rate has triggered a domino effect for MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) as it has caused the benchmark interest rates to increase, leading to credit and capital concerns for the corporation. Furthermore, the possibility of higher claims related to the COVID-19 pandemic caused Suneet Kamath at Jefferies to downgrade MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) stock from a Buy to a Hold rating on December 9. The analyst also lowered the price target from $86 to $82. Kamath anticipates a challenging 2023 for the multiline insurance provider due to weakness in the overall economy.Pzena Investment Management reduced its stake in MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) by 6% during Q3 2022.6.

The STOXX fell by 1.1% as heavyweight stocks across sectors sank.U.S. e-Mini futures slid between 1-1.2%, suggesting a drop at Thursday's opening bell.The euro fell 0.6% to $1.062, but was still near Wednesday's more than six-month peak at $1.0695.Sterling was last down 0.9% at $1.2314, still close to six-month highs.Crude oil gave back some of Wednesday's 2.5% rally that was driven by forecasts of a rebound in energy demand next year on the back of China reopening after COVID lockdowns.China's economy, however, lost more steam in November as factory output slowed and retail sales fell again, hobbled by surging COVID-19 infections and widespread curbs on movement.Brent crude futures were flat around $82.70 a barrel after closing Wednesday's session up $2.02.(Additional reporting by Lucy Raitano in London and Kevin Buckland in Tokyo; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore, Arun Koyyur and Susan Fenton)]"

That's despite an increase in daily shipments of 270,000 barrels to 8.1 million barrels, the highest level since April.Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has been selling its crude at steep discounts to Asia, in particular to China and India, as it hunts for alternative buyers to replace its key European market. Now, China and India account for about two-thirds of all Russian seaborne crude exports.As major customers, the two Asian countries are demanding even bigger discounts, and that's delivering a hit on the Kremlin's war chest. According to Bloomberg estimates, Russia is losing about $4 billion a month in energy revenues.This comes alongside the impact of recent declines in global oil prices amid fears of a recession. China's imposition of strict zero-Covid rules have also weighed on energy markets, reducing the demand for crude from the world's second-biggest economy.Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, have fallen more than 8% since October even after the OPEC+ decided to slash output in a bid to support prices. The drop comes after months of high prices, with the level surging past $100 a barrel in March.

(NYSE:OMC) Before The Ex-Dividend Date,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/four-days-left-buy-omnicom-101957913.html,1671099597,STORY,['OMC'],"[Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase Omnicom Group's shares on or after the 20th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 11th of January.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.70 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$2.80 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Omnicom Group has a trailing yield of approximately 3.5% on its current stock price of $80.89. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for Omnicom Group Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. That's why it's good to see Omnicom Group paying out a modest 45% of its earnings. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Omnicom Group generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out 76% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. This is why it's a relief to see Omnicom Group earnings per share are up 5.9% per annum over the last five years. While earnings have been growing at a credible rate, the company is paying out a majority of its earnings to shareholders. If management lifts the payout ratio further, we'd take this as a tacit signal that the company's growth prospects are slowing.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Omnicom Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 8.8% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.The Bottom LineHas Omnicom Group got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share growth has been modest, and it's interesting that Omnicom Group is paying out less than half of its earnings and more than half its cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends. In summary, it's hard to get excited about Omnicom Group from a dividend perspective.In light of that, while Omnicom Group has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Omnicom Group that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

For more countries, take a look at 5 Countries That Produce the Most Greenhouse Gases. The onset of the industrial revolution from the late 1700s to the early 1860s and then the onset of the second industrial revolution after the second world war has transformed the world in ways that would be unimaginable to populations that were alive just a couple of centuries ago. From the jet engine to the marvel of modern day mass production, human beings have transformed the world around them to suit their needs and improve their standard of living.However, this development has come with its costs. The largest of these is perhaps global warming, which has led to an increase in the surface temperature of the Earth. This rise leads to a host of devastating climate events, such as droughts and a rise in sea levels, which end up causing a significant loss of life and property. According to statistics compiled by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), global temperature has risen by 1.01 degrees Celsius since 1880, oceans have warmed by 337 zettajoules since 1955, global ice sheets are dropping by a massive 427 tons each year, and since January 1993, the sea has also risen by four inches.These changes will create further turmoil in the world, according to a fresh study from the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Fueled by political instability and aided by climate change, the non governmental organization (NGO) estimates that since 2014, the number of people who need humanitarian assistance all over the globe has jumped by 81 million to a massive 339 million. It also believes that the gap between the funds needed for humanitarian assistance and the funds that are available now stands at $27 billion as of November 2022.One key source of climate change is greenhouse gases. These are the byproducts of industrial processes and engines, and the main greenhouse gas is Carbon Dioxide. While it isn't toxic to humans, this gas envelops the Earth and prevents the surface heat from escaping the atmosphere - which then contributes to global temperature rises and warming. Oil companies remain the largest source of greenhouse gases, and some culprits that have been identified by research are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco).Story continues20 Countries That Produce the Most Greenhouse GasesPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyWe consulted the World Bank's Emissions Database for global Carbon Dioxide emissions to compile our list.  The data covers emissions up to 2019. For added flavor, emissions per capita are also provided to give readers a sense of emissions irrespective of the size of the countries listed.20 Countries That Produce the Most Greenhouse Gases20. Kingdom of Thailand CO2 Emissions As Of 2019 in Kilo Tons: 422 The Kingdom of Thailand is a South Asian country that is one of the largest economies in South East Asia. The Thai economy is worth $1.4 trillion with a GDP per capita of $21,114. It is a heavy exporter, with exports constituting a large chunk of its economy. Primary Thai exports are cars, computers, rice, and other products. The country has produced 422 kilo tons of carbon dioxide emissions as of 2019 and its per capita emissions are 3.8 metric tons per capita.19. Islamic Republic of Pakistan CO2 Emissions As Of  2019 in Kilo Tons: 432 The Islamic Republic of Pakistan, or Pakistan, is a South Asian country that is the fifth most populous nation in the world. The country gained its independence from the British Empire in 1947, and it has an economy that is worth $1.5 trillion with a GDP per capita of $6,662 in purchasing power parity. Pakistan has emitted 432 kilo tons of carbon dioxide as of 2019, and it was also the target of devastating floods earlier this year due to global warming. Pakistan's Co2 emissions per capita are just 0.9 metric tons, influenced by its large population that lives mostly in underdeveloped areas.18. United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland CO2 Emissions As Of 2019 in Kilo Tons: 440 The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a European nation that is one of the great powers of the world and one that has ruled a large portion of the Earth during its existence. The British economy is worth $3.7 trillion with a GDP per capita of $55,682. Its greenhouse gas emissions are 440 kilo tons, and per capita CO2 emissions stand at 5.2 metric tons, due to a small population but high industrialization levels.17. Socialist Republic of Vietnam CO2 Emissions As Of  2019 in Kilo Tons: 450 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a South East Asian country that traces its history back to the paleolithic age. Vietnam mirrors China's development model, by laying down economic plans in terms of actions to be taken over five year time periods. Its exports depend primarily on agriculture, with Vietnam leading in exports of items such as cashew and black pepper.

Resolute Mining Limited engages in mining, exploration, development, operation, and production of gold properties in Africa, the United Kingdom, and Australia. With the latest financial year loss of US$319m and a trailing-twelve-month loss of US$160m, the AU$341m market-cap company alleviated its loss by moving closer towards its target of breakeven. The most pressing concern for investors is Resolute Mining's path to profitability – when will it breakeven? We've put together a brief outline of industry analyst expectations for the company, its year of breakeven and its implied growth rate. View our latest analysis for Resolute Mining Resolute Mining is bordering on breakeven, according to the 4 Australian Metals and Mining analysts. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2023, before generating positive profits of US$25m in 2024. So, the company is predicted to breakeven approximately 2 years from now. What rate will the company have to grow year-on-year in order to breakeven on this date? Using a line of best fit, we calculated an average annual growth rate of 87%, which is rather optimistic! Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.earnings-per-share-growthWe're not going to go through company-specific developments for Resolute Mining given that this is a high-level summary, but, keep in mind that by and large metals and mining companies, depending on the stage of operation and metals mined, have irregular periods of cash flow. This means, large upcoming growth rates are not abnormal as the company is beginning to reap the benefits of earlier investments.One thing we would like to bring into light with Resolute Mining is its relatively high level of debt. Typically, debt shouldn’t exceed 40% of your equity, which in Resolute Mining's case is 67%. A higher level of debt requires more stringent capital management which increases the risk around investing in the loss-making company.Story continuesNext Steps:This article is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis on Resolute Mining, so if you are interested in understanding the company at a deeper level, take a look at Resolute Mining's company page on Simply Wall St. We've also put together a list of pertinent aspects you should further examine:Valuation: What is Resolute Mining worth today?

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ETBitcoin Seesaws but Holds at $17.8KBy James RubinBitcoin looked primed to continue its momentum this week before U.S. central bank Chair Jerome Powell damped investors' mood with a pointed reminder that the Fed was not finished with its monetary hawkishness even after lowering its latest interest rate hike to 50 basis points.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $17,811, roughly where it stood 24 hours earlier. BTC had topped $18,300 earlier in the day following an unexpected slowing in November's inflation data and the Fed's anticipated dovish turn. But in a press conference following the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) rate announcement, Powell returned to a months-long theme that rising prices presented the biggest threat to the economy.“50 basis points is still a historically large increase and we still have some ways to go,” Powell said at a press conference following the FOMC statement.Ether followed a similar pattern, rising earlier in the day before dropping to trade at $1,308, down about a percentage point from Tuesday, same time. Most other major cryptocurrencies were in the red, albeit not by much with UNI, the token of decentralized exchange Uniswap, and LINK, the token of software platform Chainlink, falling 3.2% and 3.1%, respectively.The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently sank 0.33%.Story continuesEquity indexes troubled by Powell's comments closed down with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 off 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Tuesday's consumer price index fell to 7.1%, lower than the 7.3% projected by economists responding to a FactSet survey.The Fed's latest rate increase the federal funds target range to 4.25%-4.5%, the highest level in 15 years. Powell has signaled that the terminal rate – the peak rate for the current hiking cycle, expected sometime next year – will likely be over 5%. The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge each other to borrow and lend money.Meanwhile, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) are introducing a bill to crack down on money laundering and financing of terrorists and rogue nations via cryptocurrency. The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act would bring know-your-customer (KYC) rules to crypto participants such as wallet providers and miners and prohibit financial institutions from transacting with digital asset mixers, which are tools designed to obscure the origin of funds.Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, noted in an email that the current Congress, which is in its final weeks, is unlikely to pass the legislation, but that ""the Act would address some national security concerns as it requires crypto firms to play by the same rules that apply to banks and traditional firms.""Biggest GainersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorSolanaSOL+1.7%Smart Contract PlatformBitcoinBTC+0.2%CurrencyBiggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorGalaGALA−3.2%EntertainmentDogecoinDOGE−3.0%CurrencyChainlinkLINK−2.9%ComputingInsights'Dr. Copper' Offers Encouragement for Bitcoin InvestorsBy Glenn Williams Jr.Bitcoin’s correlation with copper, which moved into positive territory following the Thanksgiving holiday, has continued to rise.The increase is significant, given copper’s traditional link to economic health. Analysts often view copper as a proxy for growth, affectionately calling it “Dr. Copper” for its professorial ability to forecast trends. So copper doing well bodes well for the economy, which bodes well for bitcoin.(TradingView)Markets have been looking favorably upon copper, with the price of its futures contract increasing 8% over the last three weeks. If historic relationships hold true, this trend would imply market confidence about U.S. economic prospects.By contrast, bitcoin (BTC) has maintained a strong negative correlation with the U.S. Dollar index (DXY). Investors will be watching this index in the weeks ahead, particularly after the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) trimmed its interest rate hike to 50 basis points on Wednesday from its previous, more aggressive 75 bps increases.Still, Fed Chair Jerome Powell was unexpectedly hawkish in his comments following the rate announcement, reiterating long-held concerns about inflation.Will bitcoin follow Dr. Copper’s prescription or follow the lead of the U.S. Dollar Index?

Does the move have real merit, or is it just a short term relief rally? It could be that – just the mere fact that we're asking the question is a sign for optimism.Historically, on a seasonal basis, the market is not entering a time of the year of strong performance. From a price-chart perspective, bitcoin’s roughly $17,900 level moves the asset into a “low volume node” region – possibly indicating the potential for quick price moves.Volume nodes can be identified as zones on a price chart using the Volume Profile Visible Range tool, showing trading activity by price point. A high volume node represents areas of significant price agreement, which often coincides with slower price movement.By contrast, low volume nodes represent areas of low activity. Prices have the tendency to move rapidly through these areas until they reach the next area of agreement. An illustration of this can be seen in the 14% decline that took place on Nov 9. Bitcoin has now entered that same space, but to the upside this time around.Bitcoin 12/14/22 (TradingView)Read the full technical take here.Trending postsListen 🎧: Today’s ""CoinDesk Markets Daily"" podcast discusses the latest market movements and a look at legislative hopes for crypto in the new year.FTX Bankruptcy Court Is Warned Against Granting Bahamas 'Dangerous' IT AccessFTX Hearing in US Senate Reveals Congress Doesn’t Have Immediate AnswersBinance CEO Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao Warns Staff of Turbulent TimesAs Bitcoin, Stock Investors Cheer US Inflation Slowdown, One Macro Expert Calls for CautionBitcoin Miner Core Scientific's Lender Wants to Give Miner $72M to Avoid BankruptcyCiti Says Crypto Market Leverage, Open Interest Are Historically LowCelsius Seeks $7.7M From Voyager's Estate as Bankruptcy Cases Intertwine]"

Both instruments were still trading up 0.6% for the week.Prices of the yellow metal retreated slightly on Wednesday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that U.S. interest rates were likely to peak at higher-than-expected levels, even as the central bank hiked rates by a relatively smaller 50 basis points (bps) and outlined a slower pace of hikes.Rising interest rates were the biggest headwind to gold markets this year, as they drove up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. With Wednesday’s hike, the Fed has raised its benchmark rate by 425 basis points this year, putting it at its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis.While this did make a dent in inflation, pulling it further away from a 40-year high, inflation still remains well above the central bank’s annual target of 2%. Powell cited this as the main driver of higher-than-expected interest rates.The Fed also reiterated that it is willing to dampen U.S. economic growth and the job market in order to bring down inflation.“While the market may view inflation as being in its death throes, the Fed certainly does not. For the Fed to relax it will want to see substantial evidence that inflation is slowing, not just one or two months where core inflation has come in less than the market was expecting,” analysts at ING wrote in a note.Other precious metals were also muted, while risk-driven assets such as stocks and currencies retreated.Story continuesAmong industrial metals, copper prices retreated on Thursday amid continued uncertainty over a Chinese economic reopening.

In the 12 months through November, headline CPI climbed 7.1% - its slowest pace in about a year. British inflation also moderated more than anticipated in November, data on Wednesday showed.Following the Fed announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6%.The MSCI All World stock index was also down 0.2%. It had jumped more than 1% the previous day.In currency markets, the dollar index was still down 0.5% on the day, with the euro up 0.2% to $1.0651. The Japanese yen weakened 0.04% versus the greenback at 135.61 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.2383, up 0.23% on the day.""It was pretty much right on target with what was expected,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. ""If the markets closed positive today or modestly lower, that would be a very positive development.""European stocks were flat, with the continent-wide Stoxx 600 down 0.02% after rising 1.3% in the previous session.Story continuesIn Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose nearly 1%, with easing Chinese COVID-19 curbs boosting sentiment.""It's hard to see where more good news is going to come from on the inflation front,"" Jonas Goltermann, senior global markets economist at Capital Economics, said earlier in the day. ""The question for next year is are we going to get all the way back down to 2%.""The median projection in September was for a peak in the Fed funds rate of around 4.6% next year, but some analysts think the Fed could go higher.The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose 2 basis points to 3.481% after tumbling 11 basis points on Tuesday. Yields move inversely to prices.COMMODITIES HOLD GAINSIn commodities, oil prices rose again on Wednesday after OPEC and the International Energy Agency forecast a rebound in demand in the next year and on hopes of a slowdown in U.S. rate hikes alongside inflation.U.S. crude rose 2.33% to $77.15 per barrel and Brent was at $82.56, up 2.33% on the day.Expectations for a less aggressive monetary policy by the Fed also helped gold prices hold above the $1,800 per ounce pivot. Spot gold dropped 0.5% to $1,801.18 an ounce following the Fed announcement.Bitcoin rose slightly despite the arrest of FTX exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who was accused by U.S. prosecutors of fraud.

Once developed, these hubs can also be accessed year-round to build and sustain community-adaptive capacity in a trusted location.For 2022, the Resilience Hubs grant program has awarded $400,000 to the seven organizations listed below. These grants will be funded by PG&amp;E shareholders as part of the company’s investments in statewide wildfire resiliency and response, in accordance with a mandate from the California Public Utilities Commission.The program awarded $25,000 each to four Feasibility Projects to fund an assessment of resilience hub needs and/or conceptual ideas for a resilience hub:LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired – studying the feasibility of creating a resilience hub at Enchanted Hills Camp for the blind and visually impaired.Little Manila Rising – assessing the creation of a hub at an existing local community center.Mattole Restoration Council – studying community needs for a resilience center in Lower Mattole.North Valley Community Foundation – identifying and evaluating a network of sites across Butte County.Additionally, the program awarded $100,000 each to three Design and Build Projects toward the design and/or creation of a resilience hub.

    Wednesday, Dec. 14, 2022Big Tech's pain doesn't end at midnight on New Year's EveThe year is nearly over, and the last few days of 2022 can’t come soon enough for Big Tech. In the past 12 months, the industry went from having a sense of euphoria, with companies like Apple (AAPL) reporting record earnings, to doom and gloom, as firms like Meta (META) have been forced to layoff workers.From supply-chain bottlenecks that have blunted Apple’s ability to meet iPhone demand and the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) attempt to block Microsoft’s (MSFT) $69 billion Activision Blizzard (ATVI) deal to Amazon’s (AMZN) job cuts, 2022 has been a difficult year for the tech industry.“I think 2022 was a year of extremes for the tech business,” Bob O’Donnell, president and chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research, told Yahoo Finance. “We went from super high valuations of tech companies and, unfortunately, this sense of almost invulnerability at the beginning of the year, to almost the exact opposite by the end of the year when the realities of post-pandemic economics began to kick in.”And it’s unlikely those trends will change anytime soon. That could mean further job losses and lower share prices for companies that once seemed untouchable.It’s not just economic trouble, either. Big Tech companies continue to contend with antitrust investigations and lawsuits and a new threat to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the liability shield that protects companies that host and moderate online user-generated content.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg laid off more than 11,000 employees in 2022. (AP Photo/Nick Wass, File)But 2023 won’t be a total loss. And the industry’s biggest names could pull things together by mid year, as macroeconomic headwinds could turn around.New year, same problemsMass layoffs at companies like Meta, Snap (SNAP), and HP (HPE) roiled the tech industry in 2022, and there’s likely still more pain ahead in the near term.Story continues“I think in 2023 we're going to continue to see a little bit of resizing across a few organizations, but I think then things will settle out,” O’Donnell explained.Companies across the tech sector have also implemented hiring freezes that will continue into the new year. In November, Amazon (AMZN), which culled 10,000 workers from its payrolls, announced it is pausing incremental corporate hires, a move it expects to last several months.Beyond layoffs and hiring freezes, the slowdown in digital ad sales that has burned the likes of Google’s YouTube and Meta is also expected to continue into 2023. In its October earnings report, Google parent Alphabet reported YouTube ad sales that missed analysts’ expectations by a whopping $400 million.Meta and Snap, meanwhile, are navigating both the slowdown in ad sales and the ongoing impact of Apple’s iOS privacy changes, which have handicapped those companies’ ability to track user activity across the web.In Q3, Meta announced it is expecting fourth quarter revenue of between $30 billion and $32.5 billion. Wall Street was expecting $32.2 billion. All of this comes as Meta continues to plow billions of dollars into its metaverse efforts.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy cut 10,000 jobs in 2022. (Isaac Brekken/AP Images for NFL, File)If that’s not enough, tech companies will also have to deal with antitrust investigations and the ongoing battle over Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Google is currently fighting a suit related to its search dominance, while Meta is squaring off against the FTC, which hopes to break up the social media behemoth.Microsoft, meanwhile, is trying to buy Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, but it has to beat an FTC suit seeking to block the acquisition. The tech giant is still waiting on the E.U. and U.K.’s competition regulators to weigh in on the deal. We’ll likely hear more in early 2023.Then there’s Section 230. In 2023, the Supreme Court will hear a challenge to the law, setting up its biggest test to-date.The case, Gonzalez v. Google, has to do with whether Google’s YouTube can be held responsible for violating the Anti-Terrorism Act because its algorithm suggested user-generated terrorist videos to other users. The family of an American killed during a terror attack in France argues that Google should be deprived of Section 230 protections, because Google’s algorithm recommended videos that helped radicalize the terrorists who killed their daughter.If the court finds in favor of Gonzalez, it could mean a complete overhaul of how and if tech companies use algorithms to recommend user-generated content.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai is looking to improve efficiencies at the company in an effort to save cash. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)“I think that is the biggest uncertainty of 2023,” NYU Stern School of Business Professor Vasant Dhar told Yahoo Finance. “The [Gonzalez v. Google] case is really important because it gets at the heart of the business model of social media platforms,” he addedThere’s hope on the horizonDespite all of the doom and gloom, there is some good news ahead for tech companies in 2023. According to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, the onslaught of negative economic news should slow in the second half of the year. What’s more, software and cybersecurity should see solid growth in the new year.“I think [tech] is as under-owned as we've seen [it] going back to 2009 in terms of stocks,” Ives said. “I think we're getting into the 7th and 8th inning of the tech pain. I think big cap tech—from Apple to Microsoft, to Meta and Google— 2023 is going to be a relatively strong year for those stocks.”So while the tech industry might still be facing a difficult few months ahead, there’s at least a sense that the worst of the damage has already been done, and a turnaround is coming…eventually.By Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Among these, the most popular are the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-sales ratio (P/S). However, investors often overlook the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), which though used less often, is an easy-to-use valuation tool for identifying low-priced stocks with great returns.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Celestica, Signet Jewelers, Unum Group, Aercap and Sterling Infrastructure are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Celestica is one of the largest electronics manufacturing services companies in the world, serving the computer and communications sectors.Celestica has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Value Score of A.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the Dogs' performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dogs of the Dow Stocks Ranked By Hedge Fund Sentiment. ‘Dogs of the Dow’ is an investment strategy popularized by Michael B. O’Higgins in his 1991 book titled ‘Beating the Dow’. The strategy focuses on the highest dividend-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). In addition to this, the strategy’s main aim is to generate higher returns than DJIA by investing in high-yielding stocks at the end of the calendar year. This year’s economic situation has turned investors’ attention toward these securities as they can help them to generate stable income.Over the years, the Dogs of the Dow have generated positive returns for shareholders, becoming investors’ top choice in periods of slow economic growth. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, the Dogs returned 34.3% in 2013 through December 26, compared with a 28.9% return of the Dow during the same period. The report also mentioned that the strategy beat the market through much of the 1970s and 1980s. Another report by CNBC threw light on the positive returns of the Dogs. The report stated that the strategy has beaten the Dow in ten of the 15 years from 2000 to 2015 by an average of about 1.3%. In 2015, the DJIA delivered a 2% return to shareholders, while the Dogs returned 4%.This year’s returns also showed the supremacy of the Dogs over the broader market. As of October 28, the Dogs fell by 0.3%, compared with a 17.10% decline in the S&amp;P 500 and an 8.20% drop in the DJIA, as reported by Horan Associates.

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Archer-Daniels-Midland’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland What's The Opportunity In Archer-Daniels-Midland?According to my valuation model, Archer-Daniels-Midland seems to be fairly priced at around 17.76% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Archer-Daniels-Midland today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $78.81, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. What's more, Archer-Daniels-Midland’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.Can we expect growth from Archer-Daniels-Midland?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for Archer-Daniels-Midland, at least in the near future.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ADM seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock optimal for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ADM for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The price seems to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help gel your views on ADM should the price fluctuate below its true value.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this agribusiness giant have returned -1.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry, which ADM falls in, has lost 1.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.ADM is expected to post earnings of $1.55 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.46 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +43.7%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.32 indicates a change of -15.3% from what ADM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ADM is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ADM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of ADM, the consensus sales estimate of $26.56 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +15%. The $102.18 billion and $101.07 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +19.9% and -1.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryADM reported revenues of $24.68 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.4%. EPS of $1.86 for the same period compares with $0.97 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.75%. The EPS surprise was +30.99%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.ADM is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ADM. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share for a dividend yield of 2.3%, as of December 9.

The two most impacted Coho stocks includes Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ), which gets about 75% of its revenues outside the U.S.”9.

The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $4 billion.Third Point mentioned Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its recently-published Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)8.

Strength in the second quarter was driven by better-than-expected sales of consumable items. Guidance for the remainder of the year was increased.

Cost per available seat miles, excluding fuel and special items, is still projected to increase in the 20-23% band versus 2019. Non-operating expense is now expected in the range of $9-$10 million (earlier expectation was in the $3-$5 million band).With oil prices coming down in the latter half of the December quarter, fuel price per gallon is expected in the range of $3.50-$3.60 (earlier guidance was in the $3.50-$3.70 band). For full-year 2022, adjusted pre-tax margin is now expected in the range of 7-9% range (earlier view was in the range of 6-9%). Capital expenditure is still anticipated to be between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion.Rosy Outlook Issued for 2023Assuming air-travel demand to remain buoyant next year, ALK expects to boost its fleet to meet the anticipated high demand. As a result, capacity for 2023 is expected to increase in the 8-10% band versus 2022 levels. Non-fuel unit costs are likely to decline 1-3% on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted pre-tax margin for full-year 2023 is expected in the range of 9-12%. Capital expenditure is likely to be between $1.8 billion and $2 billion.Story continuesOn a shareholder-friendly note, ALK’s management aims to resume share buybacks early next year, following the lifting of restrictions under the CARES Act. The restrictions prohibited airlines from paying dividends or buying back shares till Sep 30.The buybacks will be made under the $1 billion repurchase plan cleared by the board of directors in August 2015. Under the authorization, $456 million remains. The buybacks are expected in the range of $75-$100 million in 2023.Notably, another airline, Southwest Airlines LUV has decided to start paying quarterly dividends after a pandemic-induced hiatus of more than two years following the removal of the restrictions. LUV’s management announced earlier this month that it was reinstating its quarterly dividend of 18 cents per share. With the carrier returning to profitability in March 2022 and expecting to be profitable for full-year 2022 as well, the decision was hugely-expected. The dividend will be paid out on Jan 31, 2023 to its shareholders of record at the close of business on Jan 10, 2023.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksAlaska Air and Southwest Airlines both carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), at present.

According to the analyst, Colgate's Q3 results did not play out as he had expected and bucked the trend seen across staples this earnings season.At the end of Q3 2022, 57 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey presented a bullish stance on Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), up from 55 a quarter earlier. The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $4 billion.Third Point mentioned Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its recently-published Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)8.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221214005780/en/(Photo: DAT Freight &amp; Analytics)The DAT Truckload Volume Index (TVI) for van freight was 218, down 9.5% compared to October and 4.4% lower year over year. The refrigerated (""reefer"") TVI was 170, 4.5% lower than in October and down 5.0% year over year.At 218, the flatbed TVI also fell 11% compared to October but was 13% higher year over year.""There was seasonality in the van and reefer markets around the Thanksgiving holiday, but also a surge in volume in major intermodal ramp markets like Los Angeles, Chicago and Kansas City,"" said Ken Adamo, DAT Chief of Analytics. ""Shippers used the spot market to reduce the risk of disruptions ahead of a potential rail strike.""Spot rates continued to slideSpot rates were lower for all three equipment types.The spot van rate fell 5 cents to $2.38 per mile, a 55-cent decline year over year, while the average reefer rate was $2.80 per mile, down 1 cent month over month and 65 cents lower year over year. The average flatbed rate was $2.82 per mile, 6 cents lower than the October average and down 24 cents year over year.Spot rates are ""all-in"" rates and do not include a separate fuel surcharge. Line-haul rates (subtracting an amount equal to an average fuel surcharge) sunk to their lowest point in nearly 2.5 years.The van line-haul rate dropped 6 cents to $1.71 a mile, and the reefer rate fell 2 cents to $2.07 a mile, the lowest since June 2020 when fuel surcharges averaged 19 cents for van freight and 21 cents for reefer freight.Story continuesThe line-haul flatbed rate averaged $2.02 a mile, down 7 cents month over month and 54 cents year over year.Line-haul van and reefer rates have fallen each month since January, when they were $2.70 and $3.15 a mile, respectively.Load-to-truck ratios were downLoad-to-truck ratios, an indicator of demand on the spot market, declined for all three equipment types.The national average van load-to-truck ratio was 2.7, meaning there were 2.7 loads for every van posted to the DAT One network. The van ratio was the lowest monthly figure since May 2020 and 1.5 less than in November 2021. The reefer ratio averaged 4.9, down from 5.1 in October, and the flatbed ratio was 9.3, down from 12.5 in October. The flatbed ratio fell for the eighth straight month.Spread between contract and spot rates increasedThe national average shipper-to-broker contract van rate fell 2 cents in November to $3.07 a mile, 12 cents higher than the contract rate in November 2021. The average contract reefer rate was $3.37 a mile, down 1 cent and 27 cents higher year over year, and the average flatbed rate increased by 3 cents to $3.65 a mile, 31 cents higher year over year.The spread between spot and contract rates for van and reefer freight increased during November. Average spot and contract van rates were virtually equal in February. While spot rates have fallen throughout 2022, contract pricing has been softening since the middle of the year.""November contract replacement rates—the difference in the rate when one contract ends and another begins—were 12% and 16% lower for vans and reefers, respectively, compared to October,"" Adamo said. ""We expect spot and contract pricing to continue a downward trajectory but for the gap to narrow during the first quarter of 2023.""About the DAT Truckload Volume IndexThe DAT Truckload Volume Index reflects the change in the number of loads with a pickup date during that month; the actual index number is normalized each month to accommodate any new data sources without distortion. A baseline of 100 equals the number of loads moved in January 2015, as recorded in DAT RateView, a truckload pricing database and analysis tool with rates paid on an average of 3 million loads per month.Spot truckload rates are negotiated for each load and paid to the carrier by a freight broker. National average spot rates are derived from payments to carriers by freight brokers, third-party logistics providers and other transportation buyers for hauls of 250 miles or more with a pickup date during the month reported.

However, escalation in cost is worrisome.Aptiv reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2022 results. Adjusted earnings of $1.28 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23.1% and increased more than 100% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues of $4.6 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.7% and increased 26.3% year over year.How Is Aptiv Faring?Aptiv is exposed to the lucrative connected cars market. With safety becoming a key selling point for connected cars, automakers are increasingly seeking related technologies. This is one of the reasons behind the quick advancement of the driver-assistance system market.Demand for personalization, infotainment connectivity and convenience is also increasing rapidly. Furthermore, added features require more wiring inside vehicles. We believe that with excellent system integration expertise, Aptiv is well positioned to leverage on growing electrification, connectivity and autonomy trends in the automotive sector.Aptiv has a sound liquidity position. Its current ratio (a measure of liquidity) was at 2.66 at the end of third-quarter 2022, higher than 2.63 recorded at the end of the second-quarter and the prior-year quarter's recorded figure of 2.11. A current ratio greater than 1.5 is usually considered good for a company. This may imply that the risk of default is less.Cost Woes ContinueAptiv is witnessing escalation in costs as it continues to invest in organic as well as inorganic growth and remains embroiled in legal matters.

That is, insiders acquired the stock in greater numbers than they sold it.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Netflix Netflix Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Co-Founder Wilmot Hastings for US$20m worth of shares, at about US$393 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$318 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. Wilmot Hastings was the only individual insider to buy shares in the last twelve months.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeNetflix is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Insider Ownership Of NetflixI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Netflix insiders own about US$1.9b worth of shares (which is 1.3% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Netflix Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like Netflix insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. Of course, the future is what matters most.

There's leaking but there's also planting of stories. So if the comms team want to be able to remove a negative story about their principal, they will trade and give you something about someone else's principal. So the offices end up working against each other.""William and I both saw what happened in our dad's office and we made an agreement we would never let that happen to our office.""I would far rather get destroyed in the press than play along with this game, or this business of trading. To see my brother's office copy the very same thing that we promised the two of us would never ever do, that was heartbreaking.""On ties with William:""The saddest part of it was this wedge created between myself and my brother so he is now on the institution side. Part of that, I get. That is his inheritance. To some extent that is already engrained in him, that part of his responsibility is the survivability and continuation of this institution.""On his feelings towards his family:""I felt really distant from the rest of my family, which was interesting because so much of how they operate is about what it looks like rather than what it feels like. And it looked cold, but it also felt cold.""MEGHAN AND HARRY ON THE MEDIA AND PRESSUREStory continuesMeghan on royals and the media:""You would just see it play out. Like a story about someone in the family would pop up for a minute and they would go: 'got to make that go away'.""But there is a real estate on a website home page, on a newspaper front cover, and something has to be filled in there about someone royal.""Harry on Meghan's miscarriage:""I believe my wife suffered a miscarriage because of what the Mail did,"" he said, referring to the British tabloid newspaper. ""I watched the whole thing.""Now do we absolutely know that the miscarriage was caused by that? Of course we don't, but bearing in mind the stress that that caused, the lack of sleep, and the timing of the pregnancy - how many weeks in she was, I can say from what I saw, that miscarriage was created by what they were trying to do to her.""Harry on pressure to show off son Archie after birth:""The amount of abuse we got... for not wanting to serve our child up on a silver platter was incredible.""Harry on Meghan and a missed opportunity:""Anyone inside that system, whether it's my family, whether it's staff, whether it's PR, whoever it is, has missed an enormous opportunity with my wife and how far that would go globally.""Harry on support in the family:""The issue is when someone who's marrying in, and should be a supporting act, is then stealing the limelight or doing the job better than the person who was born to do this. That upsets people, it shifts the balance.""Meghan on feeling suicidal:""I was like, all of this will stop if I'm not here. And that was the scariest thing about it because it was such a clear thinking.""""I wanted to go somewhere to get help but I wasn't allowed to, they were concerned about how that would look for the institution.""

But among streamers, who will come out on top? Our next guest has an answer for us. Let's bring in Laura Martin, Needham senior media and internet analyst. Laura, nice to see you. Who is winning at this point? And where are we in the game? Are we in the third inning? Are we in the seventh inning?LAURA MARTIN: So we're arguing that we're in the seventh inning, that the die is cast, that the winners are the Disney bundle, which is Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus, as well as Amazon's bundle with Prime shipping on the subscriber side, and then YouTube on the, let's call it, advertising video on-demand free side. And that losers include Netflix, Peacock, Paramount Plus, which also has Showtime, and Discovery with HBO Max. We're saying all of them lose.We're also-- we came out with a piece today saying that the winners can't be displaced, that the three winners will not be able to be unseated. And that 70% to 80% of the total economics will end up in those three companies, which is what we've seen in digital markets, this notion that digital markets are winner-take-all markets for economics. We're arguing that's going to happen here in streaming. And so those three companies are going to get like 70% of the total revenue.SEANA SMITH: So Laura, when it comes to Netflix, specifically, because I think a lot of people, when they think about streaming, one of the first companies they think about is Netflix, what exactly are they doing that has them, I guess, as one of your ""losers,"" quote, unquote, to put it, going forward in this space? And then what happens to the company down the road? Do you still think a possible takeover is in the cards?Story continuesLAURA MARTIN: Right. So what has to happen in 2023? So churn is going up, right? We've created this consumer behavior, where people churn out two to three times out of the typical streaming service, usually around content, like, for example, Netflix hit all-time high churn right after Stranger Things ended in July. So we're creating this consumer behavior where people are churning in and out of streaming services.So churn is job one for 2023. You have to get your churn down because the customer acquisition costs means you have to have a subscriber for like nine months before you get a payback just on your customer acquisition cost. So churn has to go down. Well, Netflix starts with the lowest churn, so that's really hard for them to get their churn to go lower.And then secondly, the other growth driver for revenue is rolling out into new countries. No one else is fully penetrated, so they're all going to report faster revenue growth, because they're going to roll out Saudi Arabia, or they're going to roll out Costa Rica, or they're going to roll out, Portugal. Guess what? Netflix is already in those countries. So it can't like, grow there. It's like a same store comp for them, which means they're going to lose subscribers, we think, to these other guys that are going to be more competitive with bundling, with their bundles with their theme parks, or with their bundles with their Prime shipping, or Apple with their devices. All those bundles are going to take share from Netflix, which can't bundle because it doesn't own anything else. And if you're rolling out new countries, that helps your revenue growth a lot.DAVE BRIGGS: And in your note, you say Netflix has a competitive disadvantage. Is that why? And could they find a dance partner?LAURA MARTIN: They could if they got bought, like, for example, I think it's widely-- it's a confusion why they picked Microsoft, which actually doesn't have very good ad tech for what they need it for. And there's plenty of established players that would have been a better choice. I think assuming that the Netflix guys really are thinking strategically rather than tactically, it maybe they just want to sell to Microsoft. So that would make sense to me. Then they would have a bundle, because now they have something bigger to offer with Microsoft.But standalone? No, I don't think they can create a bundle-- too late. I mean, these other companies are competing with, whether it's Comcast or Paramount. They have parks. They have films. They have other streaming services that they-- all those are bundle opportunities for sort of everybody else other than them.SEANA SMITH: Laura, one company we haven't mentioned yet that's in the streaming space is Apple. Where do they land in your thesis just in terms of the winners and losers? And what we can expect from the company going forward?LAURA MARTIN: So Apple is the sleeping giant here. I would say they've done a bad job to date of actually the streaming content business. They're spending round numbers $2 billion a year. This is a game where you have to spend 15, or you're not serious. So the only thing I'd say is they make $90 billion a year of free cash flow, and they have a billion unique users.So if they ever got serious, they would be a juggernaut. They could unseat everybody that I've said can't be unseated, because they have $90 billion cash flow and a billion unique users globally, like, on day one. So they're like the dark horse I think it is possible they never decide they need to be in the content business. I think near-term, they're going to be focusing on advertising revenue. And content is messy, and it's hard to manage the people, as we've seen from the Walt Disney company's CEO trader trading off. It's hard to manage creative people. So maybe Apple just stays away from content and just keeps doing $1 or $2 billion a year, exclusive to its platform, not really a major streaming player.DAVE BRIGGS: Interesting contract with Major League Soccer, but other than Ted Lasso, not a lot of major buzz around their content. If we're in the seventh inning, that means it's almost game over for somebody. Will we see someone not survive this game? Who is it? And before you go, you got to tell me what you're watching right now, Laura. What are you streaming?LAURA MARTIN: OK. ""Wednesday"" on Netflix. ""Wednesday,"" I think, is a really interesting sort of pro-feminist point of view and very dark, you know? So I think very interesting on Netflix. And then gave me-- yeah, so I think, so loser-- losing can be winning here. So like, Curious-- the investable companies, Curiosity Stream, Chicken Soup for the Soul, WWE, all get bought, because they have IP. They own library. They own their own content. So that gets bought by a bigger player-- Comcast, or Paramount, or-- gets bought, right? Because they're too small to compete standalone. So I think all those get bought.Paramount, I think, is interesting. If Shari Redstone, who is the controlling shareholder wants to sell, I think Paramount's a winner. I think somebody would pay a lot of money for those libraries. But if she doesn't sell and she overstays her welcome, it's way too small to compete. It's $12 billion market cap. And you're competing against Amazon and the Walt Disney Company, like, or Comcast. You know, what I'm saying, Comcast loses and Discovery, Warner Brothers loses. Like, Paramount can't compete with those companies.So they have to sell. And if they sell, they'll get a nice big premium. And they'll be a winner in this world.DAVE BRIGGS: Nice to hear you mentioned to WWE. That stock up 47% this year. It's been a remarkable performer and really an outlier. Highly recommend the ""White Lotus."" If you're not streaming it, Laura, please do. It's terrific. Season two just wrapped. Great to have you. Laura Martin, always a pleasure. Thanks so much.]"

However, the project startup was halted until repairs had been completed at Melkoya after a fire incident took place that year.The Askeladd development is a gas field project in the Barents Sea on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.  The development was completed without delay on a NOK 650-million budget, below the initial cost estimate of NOK 5.2 billion. Equinor operates the Snohvit field with a 36.79% interest.Askeladd is a satellite field of the Snohvit field and was developed as a subsea tie-in to the Snohvit facility and Hammerfest LNG. The project will deliver 18 billion cubic meters of gas and two million cubic meters of condensate to the market through the Hammerfest LNG facility.Hammerfest LNG usually delivers 18.4 million standard cubic meters of gas per day or 6.5 billion cubic meters per year. This is equivalent to the requirements of 6.5 million European households or 5% of all Norway gas exports. Hammerfest LNG supplies significant gas volumes to Europe customers and the gas from the Barents Sea strengthens Equinor’s position as a reliable gas supplier.Askeladd gas will help extend plateau production from Hammerfest LNG on Melkoya by up to three years. Askeladd and future developments will ensure further value creation and production from Hammerfest LNG in the region for decades.The next project will be Askeladd West, comprising two wells tied back to the existing infrastructure, before further development continues with onshore compression and electrification through the Snohvit Future project.Price PerformanceShares of Equinor have underperformed the industry in the past three months.

However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At TJX CompaniesIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Chairman, Carol Meyrowitz, sold US$4.8m worth of shares at a price of US$67.62 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$79.29, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 21% of Carol Meyrowitz's stake.In total, TJX Companies insiders sold more than they bought over the last year.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At TJX Companies Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at TJX Companies. Specifically, insiders ditched US$5.5m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. TJX Companies insiders own about US$152m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About TJX Companies Insiders?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. But since TJX Companies is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

117,12860734-c5c9-37e9-8c79-56e1dde4ce10,AMGN,2022-12-15,The total return for Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) investors has risen faster than earnings growth over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/total-return-amgen-nasdaq-amgn-110054695.html,1671102054,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) share price is up 53% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 42% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 26% in the last year , including dividends .In light of the stock dropping 5.1% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return. View our latest analysis for Amgen To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Amgen achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 2.8% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 9% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Amgen has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Amgen, it has a TSR of 78% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Amgen shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 26% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 12% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Amgen better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Amgen that you should be aware of before investing here.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

O’Higgins in his 1991 book titled ‘Beating the Dow’. The strategy focuses on the highest dividend-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).

The report also mentioned that the strategy beat the market through much of the 1970s and 1980s. Another report by CNBC threw light on the positive returns of the Dogs. The report stated that the strategy has beaten the Dow in ten of the 15 years from 2000 to 2015 by an average of about 1.3%. In 2015, the DJIA delivered a 2% return to shareholders, while the Dogs returned 4%.This year’s returns also showed the supremacy of the Dogs over the broader market.

If you want to see more best blue chip stocks that outperformed in 2022, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.2022 has been a challenging year for the markets as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates substantially to fight inflation. As a result of the interest rate increases, demand for some companies have weakened and valuations in the overall market have decreased as capital has moved from equities to Treasuries.With the headwinds, all three of the major market indexes have declined year to date in 2022 with the S&amp;P 500 down 16.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 6.77%, and the tech heavy Nasdaq down 28.9%.Of the three indexes, it's not surprising that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen the least given that the index is comprised of blue chip stocks.Blue chip stocks are stocks of well-known leading companies with substantial competitive advantages. Many blue chips have strong histories of increasing earnings over time and returning capital back to shareholders through dividends or stock repurchases.While the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have blue chip stocks as well, the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ index include many medium sized and smaller companies that the Dow Jones Industrial Average doesn't.November Inflation DataWhile the three indexes are down this year, the market has rallied since October as inflation has shown signs of potentially peaking.For the month of November, the consumer price index rose 7.1% year over year versus estimates of an increase of 7.3% year over year. Meanwhile, the core CPI rose only 6% year over year on an annual basis versus estimates of 6.1% year over year. The better than expected inflation numbers for November followed better than expected numbers for October as well.Given the recent inflation numbers, it remains to be seen what the Federal Reserve will do in the near term as the U.S. central bank has said one month of good data isn't enough.Story continuesFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in November, ""While October inflation data received so far showed a welcome surprise to the downside, these are a single month's data, which followed upside surprises over the previous two months. As figure 1 makes clear, down months in the data have often been followed by renewed increases. It will take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining. By any standard, inflation remains much too high.""If two months isn't good enough either and the Federal Reserve raises rates too much, it could slow the economy and cause a recession next year. If economic data fails to meet expectations, there could be more downside.If rates don't go up too much further, however, the economic slowdown might not be as bad as expected. Given the market decline so far, the stocks of some quality blue chips could trade for attractive valuations in the long term as a result.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks That Outperformed in 2022, we took 12 of the best performing Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks in terms of their year to date performance.We then ranked them based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Best Blue Chip Stocks That Outperformed in 202212.

If you want to read about some more aluminum companies, go directly to 5 Biggest Aluminum Companies In The World.Aluminum is one of the most abundant metallic elements in the Earth’s crust. It possesses many properties, being durable, malleable, strong, lightweight, flexible, and resistant to corrosion and oxidation. It also has high reflectivity and excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. It is widely used in the manufacturing of many important automobile parts, like wheels, engines, chassis, and other parts of modern cars. Globally, it is also used to produce smartphones, tablets, personal computers (PCs), refrigerators, and other electronic items.The market growth in the aluminum sector can be attributed to the extensive use of the metal in different industries across the globe. For instance, in addition to being important for electronics and cars, it is employed in the food and beverage industry for making packaging containers, in the cosmetics industry for packing and protecting cosmetic products, in the production of different dosage forms of medications, including capsules, creams, lotions, liquid, and powders, and other pharma products. The aluminum market, like other sectors of the economy, was severely affected by the COVID-19 crisis. However, since then, demand for cars and electronics have skyrocketed. The aluminum industry has not taken full advantage of this rise in demand since the onset of inflation following the market recovery has resulted in a shortage of workers in the manufacturing sectors, in tandem with a fall in demand from the aerospace and automotive industries. The rising consumption of packaged foods is offsetting this to some extent. Despite the near-term headwinds, it is expected that the aluminum market will rise in the coming years. Conservative estimates of the aluminum market size before the end of this decade place it around $277 billion, predicting a compound annual growth rate of more than 5.6%. Some of the top firms working in the aluminum sector include Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), among others discussed in detail below. Story continuesOur MethodologyThese were picked from a careful assessment of the aluminum industry.

The current price of aluminum is unsustainably low, below its cost of production, despite inventories being at historic lows. We believe these depressed prices are due to the evaporation of Chinese demand resulting from its zero COVID-19 policy, but that it will likely recover over the next few quarters.Additionally, Alcoa is leading the industry in reducing carbon emissions from its smelting process which is helping to improve its cost position relative to global competitors. Given its compelling valuation and strong free cash flow yield, we are confident in the company as it is increasingly relied upon to meet the growing structural demand from electrification and the global energy transition.”8.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ETBitcoin Seesaws but Holds at $17.8KBy James RubinBitcoin looked primed to continue its momentum this week before U.S. central bank Chair Jerome Powell damped investors' mood with a pointed reminder that the Fed was not finished with its monetary hawkishness even after lowering its latest interest rate hike to 50 basis points.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $17,811, roughly where it stood 24 hours earlier. BTC had topped $18,300 earlier in the day following an unexpected slowing in November's inflation data and the Fed's anticipated dovish turn. But in a press conference following the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) rate announcement, Powell returned to a months-long theme that rising prices presented the biggest threat to the economy.“50 basis points is still a historically large increase and we still have some ways to go,” Powell said at a press conference following the FOMC statement.Ether followed a similar pattern, rising earlier in the day before dropping to trade at $1,308, down about a percentage point from Tuesday, same time. Most other major cryptocurrencies were in the red, albeit not by much with UNI, the token of decentralized exchange Uniswap, and LINK, the token of software platform Chainlink, falling 3.2% and 3.1%, respectively.The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently sank 0.33%.Story continuesEquity indexes troubled by Powell's comments closed down with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 off 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Tuesday's consumer price index fell to 7.1%, lower than the 7.3% projected by economists responding to a FactSet survey.The Fed's latest rate increase the federal funds target range to 4.25%-4.5%, the highest level in 15 years. Powell has signaled that the terminal rate – the peak rate for the current hiking cycle, expected sometime next year – will likely be over 5%. The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge each other to borrow and lend money.Meanwhile, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) are introducing a bill to crack down on money laundering and financing of terrorists and rogue nations via cryptocurrency. The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act would bring know-your-customer (KYC) rules to crypto participants such as wallet providers and miners and prohibit financial institutions from transacting with digital asset mixers, which are tools designed to obscure the origin of funds.Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, noted in an email that the current Congress, which is in its final weeks, is unlikely to pass the legislation, but that ""the Act would address some national security concerns as it requires crypto firms to play by the same rules that apply to banks and traditional firms.""Biggest GainersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorSolanaSOL+1.7%Smart Contract PlatformBitcoinBTC+0.2%CurrencyBiggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorGalaGALA−3.2%EntertainmentDogecoinDOGE−3.0%CurrencyChainlinkLINK−2.9%ComputingInsights'Dr. Copper' Offers Encouragement for Bitcoin InvestorsBy Glenn Williams Jr.Bitcoin’s correlation with copper, which moved into positive territory following the Thanksgiving holiday, has continued to rise.The increase is significant, given copper’s traditional link to economic health. Analysts often view copper as a proxy for growth, affectionately calling it “Dr. Copper” for its professorial ability to forecast trends. So copper doing well bodes well for the economy, which bodes well for bitcoin.(TradingView)Markets have been looking favorably upon copper, with the price of its futures contract increasing 8% over the last three weeks. If historic relationships hold true, this trend would imply market confidence about U.S. economic prospects.By contrast, bitcoin (BTC) has maintained a strong negative correlation with the U.S. Dollar index (DXY). Investors will be watching this index in the weeks ahead, particularly after the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) trimmed its interest rate hike to 50 basis points on Wednesday from its previous, more aggressive 75 bps increases.Still, Fed Chair Jerome Powell was unexpectedly hawkish in his comments following the rate announcement, reiterating long-held concerns about inflation.Will bitcoin follow Dr. Copper’s prescription or follow the lead of the U.S. Dollar Index?

Both instruments were still trading up 0.6% for the week.Prices of the yellow metal retreated slightly on Wednesday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that U.S. interest rates were likely to peak at higher-than-expected levels, even as the central bank hiked rates by a relatively smaller 50 basis points (bps) and outlined a slower pace of hikes.Rising interest rates were the biggest headwind to gold markets this year, as they drove up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. With Wednesday’s hike, the Fed has raised its benchmark rate by 425 basis points this year, putting it at its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis.While this did make a dent in inflation, pulling it further away from a 40-year high, inflation still remains well above the central bank’s annual target of 2%. Powell cited this as the main driver of higher-than-expected interest rates.The Fed also reiterated that it is willing to dampen U.S. economic growth and the job market in order to bring down inflation.“While the market may view inflation as being in its death throes, the Fed certainly does not. For the Fed to relax it will want to see substantial evidence that inflation is slowing, not just one or two months where core inflation has come in less than the market was expecting,” analysts at ING wrote in a note.Other precious metals were also muted, while risk-driven assets such as stocks and currencies retreated.Story continuesAmong industrial metals, copper prices retreated on Thursday amid continued uncertainty over a Chinese economic reopening. While the country relaxed several anti-COVID measures this month, it is facing a large spike in infections- so much so that the government said it was now impossible to track the virus’ spread.Copper futures fell 0.3% to $3.8522 a pound. Uncertainty over China, the world’s largest copper importer, is expected to spur more near-term volatility in markets.Copper was also dented by the prospect of slowing global economic growth, especially as the Fed signaled a potential cooling in the U.S. economy.Related ArticlesGold spooked by hawkish Fed outlook despite smaller rate hikeTC Energy restarts segment of Keystone pipeline unaffected by oil spillOil prices largely unchanged amid demand hopes, interest rate hike]"

The Fed raised interest rates by half a percentage point and projected at least an additional 75 basis points of increases in borrowing costs by the end of 2023 as well as a rise in unemployment and a near stalling of economic growth in the world's largest economy. ""At the moment, the buck is slightly up since the Fed will indeed continue to hike interest rates, and are expected to go to over 5.0% by the time they are done. Moves going forward will be very data-dependent and I expect Powell to lean on that for an uncertain 2023,"" said Juan Perez, director of trading at Monex. ""BRL, MXN and LATAM all seem to be slightly weaker, but we feel there will be other economic variables at play that will improve currencies against the buck even with a hawkish, yet predictable Fed."" Risky assets of emerging markets have taken a hit but investors expect EM to hold up against developed markets next year with an HSBC survey predicting a ""distinct improvement"" in investor sentiment, led by Latin America. Brazil's real slid 0.4% after data showed economic activity contracted in October as aggressive interest-rate hikes to battle inflation took a toll on growth. Incoming Finance Minister Fernando Haddad has promised to move up the timeline on new fiscal rules, seen as crucial to sort out public finances, but has not committed to any dates. Haddad also downplayed possible changes to the country's State-Owned Enterprise Law to make it easier for politicians to take roles at state-run firms, saying effective auditing from the federal government is more important. President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, meanwhile, appointed Workers Party (PT) veteran Aloizio Mercadante to run the development bank BNDES. ""The appointment of Mercadante for BNDES raises concerns that the subsided credit loans policy implemented in the past could resume,"" Citigroup strategists said in a note. Political unrest continued to weigh on the Peruvian sol . Peru's defense minister announced a nationwide state of emergency , which will take effect in the next few hours and allow soldiers to assist police in maintaining public safety after a week of fiery protests and road blockades sparked by the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo. ""The unrest is already causing economic damage, and the fallout will be even larger if protests start to impact mining activity,"" said Kimberley Sperrfechter, EM economist at Capital Economics. Peru's is the world second largest producer of copper. The Supreme Court is considering the prosecution's request for up to 18 months of preventative arrest for Castillo after he was charged with rebellion and conspiracy. Peru's new government is looking at economic stimulus measures for regions roiled by protests, but will hold steady to ""non-negotiable"" fiscal deficit targets, the economy minister said. If the government loosens purse strings, that could put Peru's public finances under strain, while sustained protests could lead to shortages, which would force the central bank to stay restrictive as inflation will likely pick up, she said.

This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for General Dynamics The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At General DynamicsThe Senior VP, Gregory Gallopoulos, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.5m worth of shares at a price of US$228 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$249, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 8.0% of Gregory Gallopoulos's holding. Gregory Gallopoulos was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.Gregory Gallopoulos sold a total of 21.77k shares over the year at an average price of US$233.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company.

We'll use ROE to examine NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for NextEra Energy How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NextEra Energy is:6.3% = US$2.9b ÷ US$47b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.06 in profit.Does NextEra Energy Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, NextEra Energy has a lower ROE than the average (9.1%) in the Electric Utilities industry.roeThat's not what we like to see. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for NextEra Energy by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining NextEra Energy's Debt And Its 6.3% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by NextEra Energy, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.39. The combination of a rather low ROE and significant use of debt is not particularly appealing. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

To take the example of the energy sector, 88.7% of companies’ CEOs donated to the GOP.  Most companies that leaned towards the GOP were based in the Midwest and the South. Additionally, male CEOs were more likely to donate to Republicans than female CEOs. However, big business, especially sectors like technology, are more and more leaning towards the Democrats for several reasons for quite some time. Some latest policy changes and new laws in the US are also increasing the popularity of the Democrats among corporate America.For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act passed on August 12, with a budget of $370 billion, aims to incentivize clean energy technologies for the next 10 years. This will include tax breaks and carbon credits for renewable energy companies as well as subsidies for a maximum of $85 per metric ton of carbon capture for companies developing carbon capture technologies. Such democratic policies in the past have greatly helped companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR). For instance, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has received a total of $3.2 billion since 2009 in various subsidies like tax breaks and carbon credits from the state of California. Story continuesPhoto by Saketh Garuda on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of 15 most conservative companies in the USA, we’ve ranked companies based on the percentage of their 2022 election cycle donations that went to the Republican congressional candidates.

If you want to read about some more aluminum companies, go directly to 5 Biggest Aluminum Companies In The World.Aluminum is one of the most abundant metallic elements in the Earth’s crust. It possesses many properties, being durable, malleable, strong, lightweight, flexible, and resistant to corrosion and oxidation. It also has high reflectivity and excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. It is widely used in the manufacturing of many important automobile parts, like wheels, engines, chassis, and other parts of modern cars. Globally, it is also used to produce smartphones, tablets, personal computers (PCs), refrigerators, and other electronic items.The market growth in the aluminum sector can be attributed to the extensive use of the metal in different industries across the globe. For instance, in addition to being important for electronics and cars, it is employed in the food and beverage industry for making packaging containers, in the cosmetics industry for packing and protecting cosmetic products, in the production of different dosage forms of medications, including capsules, creams, lotions, liquid, and powders, and other pharma products. The aluminum market, like other sectors of the economy, was severely affected by the COVID-19 crisis. However, since then, demand for cars and electronics have skyrocketed. The aluminum industry has not taken full advantage of this rise in demand since the onset of inflation following the market recovery has resulted in a shortage of workers in the manufacturing sectors, in tandem with a fall in demand from the aerospace and automotive industries. The rising consumption of packaged foods is offsetting this to some extent. Despite the near-term headwinds, it is expected that the aluminum market will rise in the coming years. Conservative estimates of the aluminum market size before the end of this decade place it around $277 billion, predicting a compound annual growth rate of more than 5.6%. Some of the top firms working in the aluminum sector include Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), among others discussed in detail below. Story continuesOur MethodologyThese were picked from a careful assessment of the aluminum industry.

Alcoa Corporation has its R&amp;D centers in the US, where the largest one, the Alcoa Technical Center, has its own unique zip code and an extensive intellectual and physical resource for innovation. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, 44 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $580 million in Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA), compared to 39 in the preceding quarter worth $1.2 billion. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Renaissance Technologies is a leading shareholder in Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) with 4 million shares worth more than $140 million. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We bought Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA), a leading aluminum producer, after the stock sold off over lower commodity prices. The current price of aluminum is unsustainably low, below its cost of production, despite inventories being at historic lows. We believe these depressed prices are due to the evaporation of Chinese demand resulting from its zero COVID-19 policy, but that it will likely recover over the next few quarters.Additionally, Alcoa is leading the industry in reducing carbon emissions from its smelting process which is helping to improve its cost position relative to global competitors. Given its compelling valuation and strong free cash flow yield, we are confident in the company as it is increasingly relied upon to meet the growing structural demand from electrification and the global energy transition.”8.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ETBitcoin Seesaws but Holds at $17.8KBy James RubinBitcoin looked primed to continue its momentum this week before U.S. central bank Chair Jerome Powell damped investors' mood with a pointed reminder that the Fed was not finished with its monetary hawkishness even after lowering its latest interest rate hike to 50 basis points.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $17,811, roughly where it stood 24 hours earlier. BTC had topped $18,300 earlier in the day following an unexpected slowing in November's inflation data and the Fed's anticipated dovish turn. But in a press conference following the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) rate announcement, Powell returned to a months-long theme that rising prices presented the biggest threat to the economy.“50 basis points is still a historically large increase and we still have some ways to go,” Powell said at a press conference following the FOMC statement.Ether followed a similar pattern, rising earlier in the day before dropping to trade at $1,308, down about a percentage point from Tuesday, same time. Most other major cryptocurrencies were in the red, albeit not by much with UNI, the token of decentralized exchange Uniswap, and LINK, the token of software platform Chainlink, falling 3.2% and 3.1%, respectively.The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently sank 0.33%.Story continuesEquity indexes troubled by Powell's comments closed down with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 off 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Tuesday's consumer price index fell to 7.1%, lower than the 7.3% projected by economists responding to a FactSet survey.The Fed's latest rate increase the federal funds target range to 4.25%-4.5%, the highest level in 15 years. Powell has signaled that the terminal rate – the peak rate for the current hiking cycle, expected sometime next year – will likely be over 5%. The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge each other to borrow and lend money.Meanwhile, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) are introducing a bill to crack down on money laundering and financing of terrorists and rogue nations via cryptocurrency. The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act would bring know-your-customer (KYC) rules to crypto participants such as wallet providers and miners and prohibit financial institutions from transacting with digital asset mixers, which are tools designed to obscure the origin of funds.Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, noted in an email that the current Congress, which is in its final weeks, is unlikely to pass the legislation, but that ""the Act would address some national security concerns as it requires crypto firms to play by the same rules that apply to banks and traditional firms.""Biggest GainersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorSolanaSOL+1.7%Smart Contract PlatformBitcoinBTC+0.2%CurrencyBiggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorGalaGALA−3.2%EntertainmentDogecoinDOGE−3.0%CurrencyChainlinkLINK−2.9%ComputingInsights'Dr. Copper' Offers Encouragement for Bitcoin InvestorsBy Glenn Williams Jr.Bitcoin’s correlation with copper, which moved into positive territory following the Thanksgiving holiday, has continued to rise.The increase is significant, given copper’s traditional link to economic health. Analysts often view copper as a proxy for growth, affectionately calling it “Dr. Copper” for its professorial ability to forecast trends. So copper doing well bodes well for the economy, which bodes well for bitcoin.(TradingView)Markets have been looking favorably upon copper, with the price of its futures contract increasing 8% over the last three weeks. If historic relationships hold true, this trend would imply market confidence about U.S. economic prospects.By contrast, bitcoin (BTC) has maintained a strong negative correlation with the U.S. Dollar index (DXY). Investors will be watching this index in the weeks ahead, particularly after the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) trimmed its interest rate hike to 50 basis points on Wednesday from its previous, more aggressive 75 bps increases.Still, Fed Chair Jerome Powell was unexpectedly hawkish in his comments following the rate announcement, reiterating long-held concerns about inflation.Will bitcoin follow Dr. Copper’s prescription or follow the lead of the U.S. Dollar Index?

Soaring prices have squeezed consumer’s disposable income and dampened the demand. To tame inflation, the Federal Reserve is resorting to interest rate hike. But a higher interest rate environment is not conducive for the retail sector.However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s recent comment about lowering the magnitude of the rate hike from December has come as a breather. Analysts are anticipating a 0.5 percentage point hike. This is down from 0.75 percentage point increases done in the recent past. Evidently, the Fed’s action will determine the course of the stock market in 2023.Meanwhile, a favorable reading on the Consumer Price Index front has added to the positive sentiment. Although the consumer price index rose 7.1% in November 2022 on a year-over-year basis, it was down from the reading of 7.7% in October. On a month-to-month basis, the consumer price index inched up 0.1% in November, decelerating from 0.4% in October.Slowing inflation will give some respite to American households and lift consumer confidence. The impact of cooling prices will surely be reflected in increased consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Market pundits believe that with the improvement in geopolitical situation inflationary pressure will gradually alleviate next year.Amid this, it is prudent to scoop up retail stocks that are currently the victims of the wild swings Wall Street has witnessed in 2022. These stocks are fundamentally sound and trading below their potential. American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. AEO, Arhaus, Inc. ARHS, Expedia Group, Inc. EXPE and Citi Trends, Inc.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, sold US$3.5m worth of shares at a price of US$438 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$485). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was 100% of Frank St. John's stake.In total, Lockheed Martin insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Lockheed Martin Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyIt's good to see that Lockheed Martin insiders have made notable investments in the company's shares. insider John Donovan spent US$251k on stock, and there wasn't any selling. This is a positive in our book as it implies some confidence.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Lockheed Martin insiders own about US$85m worth of shares. That equates to 0.07% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.What Might The Insider Transactions At Lockheed Martin Tell Us?The recent insider purchase is heartening. But we can't say the same for the transactions over the last 12 months. While recent transactions indicate confidence in Lockheed Martin, insiders don't own enough of the company to overcome our cautiousness about the longer term transactions. In short they are likely aligned with shareholders. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. While conducting our analysis, we found that Lockheed Martin has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore this.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The war, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"", has also led to strict sanctions against Russia.""This marks the beginning of a more open-minded Vietnam People's Army to U.S. weapons, and a willingness to engage deeper with the U.S. in defence as a whole,"" said Nguyen The Phuong, a military expert and researcher at the University of New South Wales.Military deals with the U.S. face many potential hurdles, including that Washington might block arms sales over human rights; concerns about the impact on Hanoi's tense relations with China; high costs; and whether U.S.-made systems can be integrated with Vietnam's legacy weapons, analysts said.The person who attended the meetings said the companies offered a range of military gear and had ""promising"" discussions about non-lethal equipment, including helicopters for internal security, plus drones, radars and other systems to keep watch on the air, the sea and space.Vietnam's defence and foreign ministries did not respond to a request for comment.Story continuesA second person familiar with the matter said talks on drones and helicopters began before the arms fair and have involved more weapons.Lockheed Martin, which showcased fighter and military transport planes at the event, declined to comment.A Boeing spokesperson referred questions to Vietnam's defence ministry. Raytheon, Textron and IM Systems Group did not respond to requests for comment.The discussions show the United States' growing efforts to gain influence with Hanoi, nearly half a century after the end of the Vietnam War. Since an arms embargo was lifted in 2016, U.S. defence exports to Vietnam have been limited to coastguard ships and trainer aircraft, while Russia has supplied about 80% of the country's arsenal.The arms fair attracted dozens of defence companies from 30 countries, all hoping to get a share of the estimated $2 billion Vietnam spends annually in arms imports amid on-off tensions with its neighbour China.Both sources, who asked not to be named because the talks were confidential, said Lockheed Martin separately had discussions with Vietnam about a new communication and defence satellite, which could replace one of the two from the U.S. company Hanoi already operates.The U.S. embassy in Hanoi declined to comment, but Ambassador Marc Knapper has said the U.S. stood ready to discuss any military item Vietnam might want to acquire.The U.S. military has already supplied two relatively small naval cutters and transferred two T-6 Texan trainer aircraft, of which another 10 will be shipped by 2027. It has also pledged Boeing ScanEagle reconnaissance drones, which have not yet been delivered.Sources and analysts said Vietnam is also considering deals with suppliers from Israel, India, and European and Northeast Asian countries. In the last decade, Israel has been the second-biggest seller of weapons to Vietnam after Russia.(Reporting by Francesco Guarascio. Editing by Gerry Doyle)]"

(NYSE:PHM) executive Brandon Jones following his alleged use of Twitter bots to stalk, harass and defame the company’s late founder William J. Pulte and his grandson Bill Pulte.Bill Pulte, who was formerly an independent director of the company, said the family filed the suit in order to “protect the legacy of Pulte Homes, my grandfather who was my mentor and partner, as well as my own reputation and to prevent Jones from doing irreparable harm through his continued spreading of vicious lies.”The lawsuit comes after years of tension between the Pulte family and Mr. Jones. Bill Pulte led the opposition to an expedited promotion of Mr. Jones in late 2018, successfully securing unanimous board approval against CEO Ryan Marshall’s request.Mr. Jones was named Chief Operating Officer of PulteGroup in October and is expected to begin in the role formally on Jan. 1, 2023.“Having recently been made aware of certain social media activity by a company executive, we are conducting a thorough investigation to determine the facts and whether there has been a violation of our company’s standards and policies,” a PulteGroup spokesman told CorpGov in an emailed statement.

An uptick in M&amp;A deals, strong earnings performance, new drug approvals, a favorable regulatory environment and pipeline successes have helped the second-half turnaround. While the broader market has grappled with rising interest rates and inflation, drugmakers have regularly announced positive clinical data and regulatory updates.Meanwhile fears of an upcoming recession in the United States have made drug/biotech stocks attractive to investors who find them safer in uncertain times. Drug/biotech companies are also likely to see significant advances in innovation in 2023. Among the large drugmakers, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Novo Nordisk, Merck and AstraZeneca are worth retaining in your portfolio.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry comprises some of the largest global companies that develop multi-million dollar drugs for a broad range of therapeutic areas like neuroscience, cardiovascular and metabolism, rare diseases, immunology, and oncology. Some of these also make vaccines, animal health, medical devices, and consumer-related healthcare products.All these players invest millions of dollars in their product pipelines and line extensions of their already-marketed drugs. Continuous innovation is a defining characteristic of pharma companies and the large drugmakers are constantly investing in drug development and the discovery of new medicines. Regular mergers &amp; acquisitions and collaboration deals are the other key features of large-drug companies.What's Shaping the Future of the Large-Cap Pharma Industry?Innovation and Pipeline Success: For big drugmakers, innovation in their pipeline is a competitive necessity and key to top-line growth. Pharma companies are constantly striving to ramp up innovation and spending a significant portion of their revenues on R&amp;D.  Successful innovation and product line extensions in important therapeutic areas and strong clinical study results may act as important catalysts for these stocks.Story continuesAggressive M&amp;A &amp; Collaboration Activity: The sector is characterized by aggressive M&amp;A activity. Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash regularly buy innovative small/mid-cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines.Also, sloppy sales of mature drugs, dwindling in-house pipelines, government scrutiny of drug prices, and the emergence of big tech firms like Apple and Google in the healthcare industry whet the M&amp;A appetite of large drugmakers.Fast-growing and lucrative markets such as oncology and cell and gene therapy are likely to remain focus areas for M&amp;A activities.Collaborations and partnerships with smaller companies are in full swing.With target valuations dropping to historic lows, big pharma players used the opportunity for large-scale M&amp;A this year. The latest in the list and also the largest deal of the year was Amgen’s announcement to buy Horizon Therapeutics earlier this week.Pipeline Setbacks &amp; Other Headwinds: The failure of key pipeline candidates in pivotal studies and regulatory and pipeline delays can be setbacks for large drug companies and significantly hurt their share prices. Other headwinds for the industry include pricing and competitive pressure, generic competition for blockbuster treatments and a slowdown in sales of some of the most high-profile older drugs.Foreign exchange headwinds, with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, increasing interest rates, persistently high inflation, supply chain pressure and the war in Europe are creating an uncertain macro environment and economic volatility.Uncertainty Surrounding the Pandemic: The pandemic hurt demand trends of physician-administered drugs of most companies. Though trends recovered in 2021, infection rates shot up significantly in the last quarter of 2021, with the rapid spread of the Omicron variant.In 2022, major waves of variants of concern emerged quickly, became dominant and were superseded by the next variant. There is still uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the pandemic on companies’ results and outlook.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is a 12-stock group within the broader Medical sector.  The group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks.The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #83, which places it in the top 33% of around 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few large drug stocks that are well-positioned to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook, let’s take a look at the industry’s performance and its current valuation.Industry Versus S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe industry has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 as well as the Zacks Medical Sector this year so far.Stocks in this industry have collectively risen 12.0% this year so far against the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s decline of 17.6% and the Zacks Medical Sector’s decline of 16.9% in the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), a commonly used multiple for valuing large pharma companies, the industry is currently trading at 16.99X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 17.72X and the Zacks Medical Sector's 22.82X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 16.99X, as low as 13.31X and at a median of 14.83X.4 Large Drugmakers to Keep an Eye OnMerck: Merck boasts more than six blockbuster drugs in its portfolio, with PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, approved for several types of cancer, alone accounting for around 40% of the company’s pharmaceutical sales. An ongoing recovery from the disruptions related to the pandemic and strong global underlying demand across its business, particularly for Keytruda and Gardasil vaccines to prevent HPV-related cancers, are improving Merck’s sales performance.Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. With continued label expansion into new indications and early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver. Merck’s Animal Health business has been a key contributor to its top-line growth, with the company recording above-market growth. The trend is expected to continue in 2023. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.Merck’s stock has risen 44.7% this year so far. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 has risen from $7.31 per share to $7.38 per share while that for 2023 has gone up from $7.21 per share to $7.34 per share over the past 60 days. Merck has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.J&amp;J: Johnson &amp; Johnson’s biggest strength is its diversified business model. It operates through pharmaceuticals, medical devices and consumer products divisions. It comprises some 250 subsidiaries, which clearly means that the business is extremely well diversified. Its diversification helps it to withstand economic cycles more effectively.J&amp;J’s Pharma unit is performing at above-market levels, supported by blockbuster drugs, Darzalex and Stelara, and contributions from newer drugs, Erleada and Tremfya. J&amp;J continues to expect its Pharmaceutical business to deliver market-leading adjusted operational sales growth in 2023 despite the Stelara loss of exclusivity in the second half in the United States.Sales in the MedTech unit are recovering and the company is focusing on growing this business through new products. J&amp;J is making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions. J&amp;J has taken meaningful steps to resolve its talc and opioid litigationJ&amp;J has a Zacks Rank of 3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 has risen from $10.01 per share to $10.04 per share over the past 60 days. The stock has risen 4.7% this year so far.Novo Nordisk: Novo Nordisk has one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry. Promising diabetes drug, Ozempic, a once-weekly injectable form of semaglutide, is generating strong sales since its launch and remains the growth engine for the company. Rybelsus, a daily oral formulation of semaglutide, is also witnessing a strong uptake.The FDA has also approved semaglutide as a weekly 2.4-mg injection for weight management in people living with obesity, under the brand name Wegovy. Other drugs like Xultophy and Saxenda are also gaining momentum. Label expansion of these existing drugs is expected to further boost sales.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 has declined from $3.27 per share to $3.23 per share while that for 2023 has gone down from $4.01 per share to $3.96 per share over the past 60 days.Novo Nordisk is a #3 Ranked stock. This Danish drugmaker’s stock has risen 18.6% this year so far.AstraZeneca: AstraZeneca’s key drugs, mainly cancer medicines, Lynparza, Tagrisso and Imfinzi should keep driving revenues. Its pipeline is strong with several phase III data readouts lined up. It has also been engaged in external acquisitions and strategic collaborations to boost its pipeline while investing in geographic areas of high growth like emerging markets.Cost-cutting efforts should drive earnings. The Alexion buyout strengthens its immunology franchise, adding several drugs that are boosting its top line.AstraZeneca has a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this British drugmaker’s 2022 EPS has risen from $3.32 to $3.36 per share while that for 2023 has increased from $3.63 to $3.66 per share over the past 60 days. The stock has risen 19.4% this year so far.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

A third option followed the first Merck dose with a placebo.""I think the study shows that both the vaccines elicit good antibody responses,"" said Dr. H. Clifford Lane, one of the researchers and a clinical director at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).Only Merck's shot can potentially be given as a single dose while J&amp;J's vaccine may need to continue as a two-dose regimen, Lane added.The NIH researchers noted that they were unable to assess the actual level of protection against the disease from the vaccines as no participants contracted Ebola during the trial, which began enrollment in 2017. But they said the vaccines were found to be safe for children and adults.""Long-term follow up of the participants in this trial is taking place to determine if and when booster doses might be needed,"" said Brian Greenwood, a study co-author from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.A total of 1,400 adults and 1,401 children aged 1 to 17 years old participated in the trials conducted in collaboration with Liberia Ministry of Health and with the University Clinical Research Center and the Center for Vaccine Development-Mali.The results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.Merck's vaccine Ervebo was approved by the European regulator and prequalified by the World Health Organization in 2019. J&amp;J's Zabdeno got European and WHO clearances in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Bavarian Nordic's Mvabea, used in the J&amp;J regimen, also received European approval in 2020 and WHO prequalification in 2021.

Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is an American multinational confectionery, food, holding and beverage and snack food company based in Chicago. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share for a dividend yield of 2.3%, as of December 9.

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Analysts’ bottom-up estimates for both 2022 and 2023 for the S&amp;P 500 Index are beginning to decline. Coho is not immune to the earnings pressure exerted by a strong USD, although the portfolio on the whole has modestly less foreign revenue exposure relative to the S&amp;P 500 Index. The two most impacted Coho stocks includes Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ), which gets about 75% of its revenues outside the U.S.”9. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number Of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is an American multinational consumer products company headquartered on Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The company specializes in the production, distribution, and provision of household, health care, personal care, and veterinary products.Earlier this November, Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman raised the price target on Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) to $76 from $72 and kept an Equal Weight rating on the shares. According to the analyst, Colgate's Q3 results did not play out as he had expected and bucked the trend seen across staples this earnings season.At the end of Q3 2022, 57 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey presented a bullish stance on Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), up from 55 a quarter earlier. The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $4 billion.Third Point mentioned Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its recently-published Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)8.

Strength in the second quarter was driven by better-than-expected sales of consumable items. Guidance for the remainder of the year was increased.

The two most impacted Coho stocks includes Philip Morris International, which essentially derives all of its revenues outside the U.S. Harkening back to Table 1, the decline in Philip Morris earnings for 2022 versus the reported earnings in 2021 is entirely related to the strengthening dollar.

An uptick in M&amp;A deals, strong earnings performance, new drug approvals, a favorable regulatory environment and pipeline successes have helped the second-half turnaround. While the broader market has grappled with rising interest rates and inflation, drugmakers have regularly announced positive clinical data and regulatory updates. Meanwhile fears of an upcoming recession in the United States have made drug/biotech stocks attractive to investors who find them safer in uncertain times. Drug/biotech companies are also likely to see significant advances in innovation in 2023. Among the large drugmakers, Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, Novo Nordisk NVO, Merck MRK and AstraZeneca AZN are worth retaining in your portfolio.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry comprises some of the largest global companies that develop multi-million dollar drugs for a broad range of therapeutic areas like neuroscience, cardiovascular and metabolism, rare diseases, immunology, and oncology. Some of these also make vaccines, animal health, medical devices, and consumer-related healthcare products. All these players invest millions of dollars in their product pipelines and line extensions of their already-marketed drugs. Continuous innovation is a defining characteristic of pharma companies and the large drugmakers are constantly investing in drug development and the discovery of new medicines. Regular mergers &amp; acquisitions and collaboration deals are the other key features of large-drug companies.What's Shaping the Future of the Large-Cap Pharma Industry? Innovation and Pipeline Success: For big drugmakers, innovation in their pipeline is a competitive necessity and key to top-line growth. Pharma companies are constantly striving to ramp up innovation and spending a significant portion of their revenues on R&amp;D.  Successful innovation and product line extensions in important therapeutic areas and strong clinical study results may act as important catalysts for these stocks.Story continuesAggressive M&amp;A &amp; Collaboration Activity: The sector is characterized by aggressive M&amp;A activity. Given that it takes several years and millions ofdollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash regularly buy innovative small/mid-cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines. Also, sloppy sales of mature drugs, dwindling in-house pipelines, government scrutiny of drug prices, and the emergence of big tech firms like Apple and Google in the healthcare industry whet the M&amp;A appetite of large drugmakers.Fast-growing and lucrative markets such as oncology and cell and gene therapy are likely to remain focus areas for M&amp;A activities. Also, collaborations and partnerships with smaller companies are in full swing.With target valuations dropping to historic lows, big pharma players used the opportunity for large-scale M&amp;A this year. The latest in the list and also the largest deal of the year was Amgen’s announcement to buy Horizon Therapeutics earlier this week.Pipeline Setbacks &amp; Other Headwinds: The failure of key pipeline candidates in pivotal studies and regulatory and pipeline delays can be setbacks for large drug companies and significantly hurt their share prices. Other headwinds for the industry include pricing and competitive pressure, generic competition for blockbuster treatments and a slowdown in sales of some of the most high-profile older drugs.Foreign exchange headwinds, with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, increasing interest rates, persistently high inflation, supply chain pressure and the war in Europe are creating an uncertain macro environment and economic volatility.Uncertainty Surrounding the Pandemic: The pandemic hurt demand trends of physician-administered drugs of most companies. Though trends recovered in 2021, infection rates shot up significantly in the last quarter of 2021, with the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. In 2022, major waves of variants of concern emerged quickly, became dominant and were superseded by the next variant. There is still uncertainty about the duration and contemplated impact of the pandemic on companies’ results and outlook.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is a 12-stock group within the broader Medical sector.  The group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks.The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #83, which places it in the top 33% of around 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few large drug stocks that are well-positioned to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook, let’s take a look at the industry’s performance and its current valuation.Industry Versus S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe industry has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 as well as the Zacks Medical Sector this year so far.Stocks in this industry have collectively risen 12.0% this year so far against the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s decline of 17.6% and the Zacks Medical Sector’s decline of 16.9% in the said time frame.Year-to-Date Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationBased on the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), a commonly used multiple for valuing large pharma companies, the industry is currently trading at 16.99X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 17.72X and the Zacks Medical Sector's 22.82X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 16.99X, as low as 13.31X and at a median of 14.83X as the chart below shows.Forward 12-Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio4 Large Drugmakers to Keep an Eye OnMerck: Merck boasts more than six blockbuster drugs in its portfolio, with PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, approved for several types of cancer, alone accounting for around 40% of the company’s pharmaceutical sales. An ongoing recovery from the disruptions related to the pandemic and strong global underlying demand across its business, particularly for Keytruda and Gardasil vaccines to prevent HPV-related cancers, are improving Merck’s sales performance.Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. With continued label expansion into new indications and early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver. Merck’s Animal Health business has been a key contributor to its top-line growth, with the company recording above-market growth. The trend is expected to continue in 2023. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.Merck’s stock has risen 44.7% this year so far. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 has risen from $7.31 per share to $7.38 per share while that for 2023 has gone up from $7.21 per share to $7.34 per share over the past 60 days.

It comprises some 250 subsidiaries, which clearly means that the business is extremely well diversified. Its diversification helps it to withstand economic cycles more effectively.J&amp;J’s Pharma unit is performing at above-market levels, supported by blockbuster drugs, Darzalex and Stelara, and contributions from newer drugs, Erleada and Tremfya. J&amp;J continues to expect its Pharmaceutical business to deliver market-leading adjusted operational sales growth in 2023 despite the Stelara loss of exclusivity in the second half in the United States.Sales in the MedTech unit are recovering and the company is focusing on growing this business through new products.

Promising diabetes drug, Ozempic, a once-weekly injectable form of semaglutide, is generating strong sales since its launch and remains the growth engine for the company. Rybelsus, a daily oral formulation of semaglutide, is also witnessing a strong uptake. The FDA has also approved semaglutide as a weekly 2.4-mg injection for weight management in people living with obesity, under the brand name Wegovy. Other drugs like Xultophy and Saxenda are also gaining momentum. Label expansion of these existing drugs is expected to further boost sales.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 has declined from $3.27 per share to $3.23 per share while that for 2023 has gone down from $4.01 per share to $3.96 per share over the past 60 days.Novo Nordisk is a #3 Ranked stock. This Danish drugmaker’s stock has risen 18.6% this year so far.Price and Consensus: NVO  AstraZeneca: AstraZeneca’s key drugs, mainly cancer medicines, Lynparza, Tagrisso and Imfinzi should keep driving revenues. Its pipeline is strong with several phase III data readouts lined up. It has also been engaged in external acquisitions and strategic collaborations to boost its pipeline while investing in geographic areas of high growth like emerging markets. Cost-cutting efforts should drive earnings. The Alexion buyout strengthens its immunology franchise, adding several drugs that are boosting its top line.AstraZeneca has a Zacks Rank #3.

The purpose of the extension is to provide further time for the full review of the submission. The companies will continue to work with the FDA to facilitate the completion of the agency’s review.The sNDA for LYNPARZA in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone is based on the Phase 3 PROpel trial, results of which were published in NEJM Evidence in June 2022. The application was granted priority review, and AstraZeneca and Merck are committed to working with the FDA to bring this treatment option to patients with mCRPC.In November, the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use adopted a positive opinion recommending approval of LYNPARZA in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC for whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated. This combination is also undergoing regulatory reviews in other countries.Approved indications for LYNPARZA are not impacted by this review period extension. Among these, LYNPARZA is approved in the U.S. for patients with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated mCRPC (BRCA-mutated and other HRR gene mutations) who have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone and in the EU, Japan and China for patients with BRCA-mutated mCRPC who have progressed following prior therapy that included a new hormonal agent (NHA). These approvals were based on the data from the Phase 3 PROfound trial.Story continuesAbout PROpelPROpel is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial testing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of LYNPARZA versus placebo when given in addition to abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone in patients with mCRPC who had not received prior chemotherapy or NHAs in the mCRPC setting. The major efficacy outcome was radiographic progression-free survival as assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1 and Prostate Cancer Working Group (bone) criteria. Overall survival was an additional efficacy outcome measure.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONCONTRAINDICATIONSThere are no contraindications for LYNPARZA.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSMyelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML): Occurred in approximately 1.5% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and the majority of events had a fatal outcome. The median duration of therapy in patients who developed MDS/AML was 2 years (range: &lt;6 months to &gt;10 years). All of these patients had previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA-damaging agents, including radiotherapy.Do not start LYNPARZA until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (≤Grade 1). Monitor complete blood count for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment. For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt LYNPARZA and monitor blood count weekly until recovery.If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. Discontinue LYNPARZA if MDS/AML is confirmed.Pneumonitis: Occurred in 0.8% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and some cases were fatal. If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, or a radiological abnormality occurs, interrupt LYNPARZA treatment and initiate prompt investigation. Discontinue LYNPARZA if pneumonitis is confirmed and treat patient appropriately.Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE): Including severe or fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) occurred in patients treated with LYNPARZA. VTE occurred in 7% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who received LYNPARZA plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to 3.1% of patients receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone plus ADT in the PROfound study. Patients receiving LYNPARZA and ADT had a 6% incidence of pulmonary embolism compared to 0.8% of patients treated with ADT plus either enzalutamide or abiraterone. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and treat as medically appropriate, which may include long-term anticoagulation as clinically indicated.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, LYNPARZA can cause fetal harm. A pregnancy test is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment.FemalesAdvise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose.MalesAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of LYNPARZA and to not donate sperm during this time.ADVERSE REACTIONS—First-Line Maintenance BRCAm Advanced Ovarian CancerMost common adverse reactions (Grades 1-4) in ≥10% of patients who received LYNPARZA in the first-line maintenance setting for SOLO-1 were: nausea (77%), fatigue (67%), abdominal pain (45%), vomiting (40%), anemia (38%), diarrhea (37%), constipation (28%), upper respiratory tract infection/influenza/nasopharyngitis/bronchitis (28%), dysgeusia (26%), decreased appetite (20%), dizziness (20%), neutropenia (17%), dyspepsia (17%), dyspnea (15%), leukopenia (13%), urinary tract infection (13%), thrombocytopenia (11%), and stomatitis (11%).Most common laboratory abnormalities (Grades 1-4) in ≥25% of patients who received LYNPARZA in the first-line maintenance setting for SOLO-1 were: decrease in hemoglobin (87%), increase in mean corpuscular volume (87%), decrease in leukocytes (70%), decrease in lymphocytes (67%), decrease in absolute neutrophil count (51%), decrease in platelets (35%), and increase in serum creatinine (34%).ADVERSE REACTIONS—First-Line Maintenance Advanced Ovarian Cancer in Combination with BevacizumabMost common adverse reactions (Grades 1-4) in ≥10% of patients treated with LYNPARZA/bevacizumab and at a ≥5% frequency compared to placebo/bevacizumab in the first-line maintenance setting for PAOLA-1 were: nausea (53%), fatigue (including asthenia) (53%), anemia (41%), lymphopenia (24%), vomiting (22%), and leukopenia (18%).

Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for LYNPARZA.Please see complete Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide.About LYNPARZA® (olaparib)LYNPARZA is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to potentially exploit DNA damage response (DDR) pathway deficiencies, such as BRCA mutations, to preferentially kill cancer cells. Inhibition of PARP with LYNPARZA leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. LYNPARZA is being tested in a range of tumor types with defects and dependencies in the DDR.LYNPARZA, which is being jointly developed and commercialized by AstraZeneca and Merck, has a broad clinical trial development program, and AstraZeneca and Merck are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumors as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types.About metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancerProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in male patients globally and is associated with a significant mortality rate. Development of prostate cancer is often driven by male sex hormones called androgens, including testosterone. In patients with mCRPC, their prostate cancer grows and spreads to other parts of the body despite the use of androgen-deprivation therapy to block the action of male sex hormones. Approximately 10-20% of patients with prostate cancer will develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) within five years, with at least 84% of these patients presenting with metastases at the time of CRPC diagnosis. Of patients with no metastases at CRPC diagnosis, 33% are likely to develop metastases within two years.About the AstraZeneca and Merck strategic oncology collaborationIn July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialize certain oncology products including LYNPARZA, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop these products in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop these oncology products in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.Merck’s focus on cancerOur goal is to translate breakthrough science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide.

A third option followed the first Merck dose with a placebo.""I think the study shows that both the vaccines elicit good antibody responses,"" said Dr. H. Clifford Lane, one of the researchers and a clinical director at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).Only Merck's shot can potentially be given as a single dose while J&amp;J's vaccine may need to continue as a two-dose regimen, Lane added.The NIH researchers noted that they were unable to assess the actual level of protection against the disease from the vaccines as no participants contracted Ebola during the trial, which began enrollment in 2017. But they said the vaccines were found to be safe for children and adults.""Long-term follow up of the participants in this trial is taking place to determine if and when booster doses might be needed,"" said Brian Greenwood, a study co-author from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.A total of 1,400 adults and 1,401 children aged 1 to 17 years old participated in the trials conducted in collaboration with Liberia Ministry of Health and with the University Clinical Research Center and the Center for Vaccine Development-Mali.The results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.Merck's vaccine Ervebo was approved by the European regulator and prequalified by the World Health Organization in 2019.

You can skip our detailed analysis of corporate political orientations in the US and go directly to 5 Most Conservative Companies in USA. Corporate America has traditionally been politically oriented largely towards the Republican Party given their fiscally conservative values. According to results from a Harvard Law School study cited by S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), over 60% of CEOs of S&amp;P 1500 companies contributed more money to the GOP than to the Democratic party between the studied period of 2000-2017.In terms of industry, companies doing business in energy, manufacturing and chemicals leaned more towards Republicans than companies in tech, finance, and telecommunications industries. To take the example of the energy sector, 88.7% of companies’ CEOs donated to the GOP.  Most companies that leaned towards the GOP were based in the Midwest and the South. Additionally, male CEOs were more likely to donate to Republicans than female CEOs. However, big business, especially sectors like technology, are more and more leaning towards the Democrats for several reasons for quite some time. Some latest policy changes and new laws in the US are also increasing the popularity of the Democrats among corporate America.For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act passed on August 12, with a budget of $370 billion, aims to incentivize clean energy technologies for the next 10 years. This will include tax breaks and carbon credits for renewable energy companies as well as subsidies for a maximum of $85 per metric ton of carbon capture for companies developing carbon capture technologies. Such democratic policies in the past have greatly helped companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR). For instance, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has received a total of $3.2 billion since 2009 in various subsidies like tax breaks and carbon credits from the state of California. Story continuesPhoto by Saketh Garuda on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor our list of 15 most conservative companies in the USA, we’ve ranked companies based on the percentage of their 2022 election cycle donations that went to the Republican congressional candidates. We’ve sourced the data from Open Secrets, a non-profit organization that tracks corporate campaign-financing and lobbying.Let’s now move to the 15 most conservative companies in USA. 15.

It is one of the reasons the company leans right, as democratic economic policies often incentivize environmentally friendly companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) while increasing oil royalty rates.11. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) Percentage of Donations to Republicans in 2022: 73.39%ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is a major energy company based in Houston, Texas.

(NYSE: SWX) (""Southwest Gas"" or the ""Company"") today announced that its Board of Directors unanimously determined to take strategic actions to simplify the Company's portfolio of businesses. These actions include entering into a definitive agreement to sell 100% of MountainWest Pipelines Holding Company (""MountainWest"") in an all-cash transaction to Williams (NYSE: WMB) for $1.5 billion in total enterprise value, subject to certain adjustments. Additionally, the Company determined it will pursue a spin-off of its wholly owned subsidiary, Centuri Group, Inc. (""Centuri""), to form a new independent publicly traded utility infrastructure services company.E. Renae Conley, Chair of the Board, said, ""After carefully evaluating all available alternatives, we are confident that simplifying our corporate structure and creating two focused industry leaders is the right outcome of our strategic review. Southwest Gas will be a leading fully regulated natural gas utility with an optimized balance sheet that will enable continued investment in safety, customer service and infrastructure and a stable and competitive dividend policy.""Ms. Conley continued, ""Centuri will benefit from a management team focused on its comprehensive service capabilities, blue-chip customer base and increasing national investments in utility infrastructure, 5G and renewables. The strategic actions we are taking create the opportunity for stockholders to own two leading independent companies poised for long-term sustainable value creation.""Story continuesKaren S. Haller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southwest Gas, stated, ""At Southwest Gas, we take pride in the critical responsibility we have to provide reliable, sustainable and affordable energy to our Arizona, Nevada and California-based customers. These transactions will allow the Company to exclusively focus on our obligations to the communities we serve while continuing to exceed customer expectations and build on the significant growth potential we have already started to realize. We have an exciting opportunity to optimize Southwest Gas in order to deliver an expected return on equity of more than 8% while continuing to invest in our utility operations and maintaining industry-leading customer satisfaction. We believe that both MountainWest and Centuri will also be best positioned to thrive following the completion of the transactions and have conviction that the strategic decisions we are announcing today will be in the best interest of all stakeholders over the long-term."" Strategic RationaleThe separation is expected to drive value for all stakeholders and create a number of benefits for Southwest Gas and Centuri, including:Unlocking value for stockholders and enhancing value transparency through more direct comparability to pure-play industry peers and stronger stockholder alignment;Providing stockholders with ownership in two independently traded public companies with compelling financial profiles that more accurately reflect the strengths and opportunities of each business, resulting in more efficient capital allocation for both businesses;Ensuring each management team can solely focus on optimizing and executing their growth plans and facilitating more tailored alignment of executive compensation;Returning Southwest Gas to its core foundation as a fully regulated natural gas utility, and unlocking long-term strategic flexibility;Positioning Southwest Gas to deliver more predictable earnings results;Providing Southwest Gas stronger financial flexibility with additional balance sheet capacity, reinforcing its commitment to maintain investment grade credit ratings;Allowing Southwest Gas to maintain a stable and competitive dividend policy;Enabling Southwest Gas to continue its focus on optimization, including generating a return on equity (""ROE"") of greater than 8%, and its focus on cost savings to enhance customer affordability and stockholder value;Allowing Southwest Gas to continue to pursue sustainable energy solutions to meet the expectations of the customers and communities the utility serves, while further elevating customer focus; andRealizing Centuri's significant growth potential without any broader business mix limitation considerations.Sale of MountainWestUnder the terms of the transaction, Southwest Gas will sell 100% of MountainWest to Williams for $1.5 billion in total enterprise value, subject to certain adjustments. Net proceeds will be used to repay the Company's approximately $1.1 billion term loan.MountainWest operates over 2,000 miles of interstate natural gas pipeline systems primarily located across Utah, Wyoming and Colorado, totaling approximately 8,031 million dekatherms per day of transmission capacity. MountainWest also holds 56 billion cubic feet of total storage capacity, including Clay Basin, the largest underground storage reservoir in the Rocky Mountain Region.The transaction is expected to close in 2023, following regulatory approvals and the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.The transaction represents an estimated loss of $350 - $425 million for Southwest Gas, net of tax.Spin-Off of Centuri The Board of Directors has unanimously decided to pursue a spin-off of Centuri. Upon completion, the separation will result in two independent publicly traded companies: Southwest Gas and Centuri. The Company is taking actions immediately to execute this transaction and plans to begin making necessary filings in the first quarter of 2023.As a standalone, independent company, Centuri, a utility services platform diversified across the U.S. and Canada, will continue to be an industry leader at the forefront of infrastructure modernization. Centuri is positioned to support the energy transition given its extensive infrastructure capabilities and attractive blue-chip customer base comprised of a diverse range of utilities. With highly recurring revenue underpinned by long-term master service agreements and stable contracts, Centuri is expected to generate strong cash flows to optimize its capital structure, invest in business prospects and provide attractive returns to stockholders.Centuri has already been operating using a standalone business model and, as such, Southwest Gas is not anticipating any material changes to Centuri's operations and cost structure, nor is Southwest Gas expecting significant dis-synergies at Southwest Gas or Centuri as a result of the spin-off. Centuri's cost structure will continue to be evaluated in the ordinary course of management's review of operations for savings opportunities.The separation is expected to be completed in approximately 12 months and to be tax free to Southwest Gas and its stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The separation will be subject to, among other things, finalizing the transaction structure, approval by the Arizona Corporation Commission, the receipt of a favorable Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling relating to the tax-free nature of the transaction, the effectiveness of a registration statement that will be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and final approval by Southwest Gas' Board of Directors. Further details related to capital structure, board composition and other elements of the transaction will be announced at a later date.There can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the proposed transactions or that the transactions will be completed.Advisors Moelis &amp; Company LLC is serving as financial advisor to the Strategic Transactions Committee of the Southwest Gas Board of Directors for the sale of MountainWest and the spin-off of Centuri.Lazard is serving as financial advisor to Southwest Gas for the sale of MountainWest and the spin-off of Centuri.UBS Investment Bank is serving as a financial advisor to Southwest Gas for the spin-off of Centuri.TD Securities and J.P.

The war, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"", has also led to strict sanctions against Russia.""This marks the beginning of a more open-minded Vietnam People's Army to U.S. weapons, and a willingness to engage deeper with the U.S. in defence as a whole,"" said Nguyen The Phuong, a military expert and researcher at the University of New South Wales.Military deals with the U.S. face many potential hurdles, including that Washington might block arms sales over human rights; concerns about the impact on Hanoi's tense relations with China; high costs; and whether U.S.-made systems can be integrated with Vietnam's legacy weapons, analysts said.The person who attended the meetings said the companies offered a range of military gear and had ""promising"" discussions about non-lethal equipment, including helicopters for internal security, plus drones, radars and other systems to keep watch on the air, the sea and space.Vietnam's defence and foreign ministries did not respond to a request for comment.Story continuesA second person familiar with the matter said talks on drones and helicopters began before the arms fair and have involved more weapons.Lockheed Martin, which showcased fighter and military transport planes at the event, declined to comment.A Boeing spokesperson referred questions to Vietnam's defence ministry. Raytheon, Textron and IM Systems Group did not respond to requests for comment.The discussions show the United States' growing efforts to gain influence with Hanoi, nearly half a century after the end of the Vietnam War. Since an arms embargo was lifted in 2016, U.S. defence exports to Vietnam have been limited to coastguard ships and trainer aircraft, while Russia has supplied about 80% of the country's arsenal.The arms fair attracted dozens of defence companies from 30 countries, all hoping to get a share of the estimated $2 billion Vietnam spends annually in arms imports amid on-off tensions with its neighbour China.Both sources, who asked not to be named because the talks were confidential, said Lockheed Martin separately had discussions with Vietnam about a new communication and defence satellite, which could replace one of the two from the U.S. company Hanoi already operates.The U.S. embassy in Hanoi declined to comment, but Ambassador Marc Knapper has said the U.S. stood ready to discuss any military item Vietnam might want to acquire.The U.S. military has already supplied two relatively small naval cutters and transferred two T-6 Texan trainer aircraft, of which another 10 will be shipped by 2027. It has also pledged Boeing ScanEagle reconnaissance drones, which have not yet been delivered.Sources and analysts said Vietnam is also considering deals with suppliers from Israel, India, and European and Northeast Asian countries. In the last decade, Israel has been the second-biggest seller of weapons to Vietnam after Russia.(Reporting by Francesco Guarascio. Editing by Gerry Doyle)]"

(UAL) has placed a massive aircraft order in commercial aviation history. The U.S. carrier ordered 100 new Boeing 787 Dreamliners, with options to purchase 100 more. UAL anticipates getting delivery of the new widebody planes between 2024 and 2032.United Airlines is also purchasing 100 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, with 44 expected to be delivered between 2024 and 2026 and 56 more MAX aircraft between 2027 and 2028.UAL expects delivery of almost 700 new narrow and widebody aircraft by 2032, including an average of more than two every week in 2023 and more than three every week in 2024.These latest aircraft orders reflect United Airlines’ investment in its future fleet and initiatives toward fleet modernization and global growth strategy. Notably, the carrier has been constantly making efforts to improvise the interiors of its existing fleet. More than 90% of UAL’s international wide bodies are equipped with the United Polaris business class seat and United Premium Plus seating. The remaining upgrade for the aircraft should get completed by 2023 summer.Almost 100 planes of the new widebody order are likely to replace older Boeing 767 and Boeing 777 aircraft, with all 767 aircraft removed from the United Airlines fleet by 2030. This should reduce carbon emissions per seat for the new planes by nearly 25% decrease, as compared to the older planes.As a result, UAL is likely to get a boost in achieving its target of being 100% green by completely reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 without relying on traditional carbon offsets. To this end, UAL is also encouraging more fuel-efficient aircraft into its fleet and investing in sustainable aviation fuel and other decarbonization technologies.The 787 Dreamliner comes with better efficiency and flexibility across its extensive network of domestic and international flights and provides a 25% improvement in fuel usage compared with the airplanes it replaces. The 737 MAX unit also brings improved fuel efficiency in the single-aisle market and lessens fuel usage and CO2 emissions by 20% compared to the airplanes it replaces.Story continuesUnited Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, stated, ""This order further solidifies our lead and creates new opportunities for our customers, employees and shareholders by accelerating our plan to connect more people to more places around the globe and deliver the best experience in the sky.""Apart from the aforementioned fleet modernization efforts, this aircraft order is also expected to create huge job opportunities for pilots, flight attendants, maintenance technicians and other related airport operations. UAL has hired 15,000 people in 2022 and is on track to add more 15,000 next year.Kate Gebo, United Airlines EVP of Human Resources and Labor Relations, stated, “We're not just creating jobs – these are long-lasting careers that offer great pay, outstanding benefits and flight privileges to see the world. And the best part is we're actively hiring across every role at the airline.""Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, United Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company will now pay out $1.40 per share, which reflects a hike of 12% from the prior dividend of $1.25.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $5.60 per share, denoting an increase of 60 cents per share from the prior dividend level. At this new rate, the annualized yield comes at 3.38%, based on the stock’s closing price of $165.63 on Dec 13. The new dividend will be paid out on Jan 31, 2023 to shareholders of record as of Jan 13, 2023.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and MAA remains committed to that. The company has a good track record of paying out dividends to its shareholders.The recent hike reflects MAA’s ability to generate solid income through its operating platform and high-quality portfolio. MAA has delivered 13 years of consecutive dividend increases.In May 2022, the company announced a common stock cash dividend of $1.25 per share, marking a 15% hike over the prior payment. Based on the dividends paid out over the trailing four quarters, MAA’s dividend yield is 3.02%.The company increased its dividend six times in the past five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 4.95%. Check Mid-America Apartment’s dividend history here.In addition, with the expected 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share growth of 20.68%, ahead of the industry’s average of 12.05%, the increased dividend is likely to be sustainable.MAA maintains a well-balanced, diverse portfolio across the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States. The portfolio is diversified in terms of markets, submarkets, product types and price points. This diversification shields the company from an economic downturn in any particular market, choppiness in any product type or assets belonging to specific price points and helps generate a consistent revenue stream.MAA’s diversified Sunbelt portfolio of suburban-focused communities was less severely affected by the pandemic and the economic shutdown. The pandemic accelerated employment shifts and population inflow into the company’s markets as renters sought more business-friendly, lower-taxed and low-density cities. These favorable longer-term secular dynamic trends are increasing the desirability of its markets. Amid these, MAA is poised to capture recovery in demand and leasing compared with expensive coastal markets.MAA’s current cash flow growth is projected at 39.17% compared with the 14.86% growth projected for the industry. Moreover, this REIT’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) highlights its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 10.60% compares favorably with the industry’s 4.78%, reflecting that MAA is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.Given its balance sheet strength and prudent financial management, the company is well-poised to capitalize on growth opportunities and reward shareholders efficiently. Moreover, looking at its lower dividend payout (compared to its industry), it seems that its dividend distribution is expected to be sustainable.So far in the quarter, shares of Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) MAA have rallied 6.8% against the industry’s decline of 1.1%.

Although, it's not wise to simply ignore the P/E without explanation as investors may be disregarding a distinct opportunity or a costly mistake.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Cigna's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to strengthen positively, which has kept the P/E from falling. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a relatively elevated price for a company with this sort of growth profile. See our latest analysis for Cigna peKeen to find out how analysts think Cigna's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is Cigna's Growth Trending?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Cigna would need to produce growth that's similar to the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 14% decrease to the company's bottom line. Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 76% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance. Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been more than adequate for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 4.0% per year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 9.1% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's curious that Cigna's P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly limited growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Maintaining these prices will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the shares eventually.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Cigna's P/EWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Our examination of Cigna's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see a weak earnings outlook with slower than market growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the moderate P/E lower. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.Before you take the next step, you should know about the 1 warning sign for Cigna that we have uncovered.If you're unsure about the strength of Cigna's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

To skip the detailed analysis of the insurance industry, go directly to the 5 Undervalued Insurance Stocks to Buy Now.Insurance is one of the largest industries in the world. An estimated $5.5 trillion worth of insurance premiums were written in 2021, which puts the industry’s market value ahead of the GDP of all countries except the US and Canada. The US has the largest insurance market in the world. In 2021, the country's total written premiums were over $2.7 trillion, which was more than its next 8 competing countries combined.Insurance Market Analysis in the Third QuarterThe US Insurance Composite Renewal Rate increased by 5% in Q3 compared to 10% in the prior quarter. Property insurance pricing surged for the 20th consecutive quarter. In Q3, it increased by 8% compared to 6% in the previous quarter. Moreover, casualty insurance pricing went up by 3%, cyber insurance by 48% and financial and professional lines declined by 6% compared to an increase of 21% in the prior quarter.In the quarter, Hurricane Ian and Fiona proved to be quite disruptive for the insurance companies. The catastrophe losses for insurance companies are estimated to be $50-$70 billion from Hurricane Ian alone. The residents of Florida already pay triple the average national amount of insurance premium at $4,321 per year, and the recent Hurricane Ian destruction might lead the insurers to either increase their premiums or cease operations in the state altogether.Insurance Industry: Current Trends and ForecastsThe insurance industry is growing at a substantially fast pace. The market of the industry was valued at $4.47 trillion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 63% to $224.34 trillion by 2028.Rising interest rates usually fare well for insurance companies as the portfolio yields rise, leading to increased investment earnings for insurers. Keeping that in mind, Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE:LNC), and The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV) are of some the undervalued insurance stocks that one should keep an eye on.Story continuesJonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyAfter carefully analyzing the insurance stocks listed on NYSE and NASDAQ, we chose these 10 stocks based on their past performance, growth prospects, dividend history, and analyst ratings. The stocks on the list are either trading at a PE ratio below the industry average of 18.6x at the time of writing or have certain growth catalysts that make the company undervalued.The stocks were listed in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds.Undervalued Insurance Stocks to Buy Now10. Prudential plc (NYSE:PUK)Number of Hedge Fund holders: 9Prudential plc (NYSE:PUK) is a British insurance company that started as a lending company in the 19th century. Although with its PE ratio of 16.78, the company seems to be fairly valued compared to the insurance industry average. However, the company’s growth prospects make it an undervalued company.Prudential plc (NYSE:PUK) is expanding to Asia and Africa. The two continents have more significant growth catalysts due to a high addressable market and low penetration of insurance companies. Prudential plc (NYSE:PUK) expects its customer base to increase from 17 million in 2021 to 50 million by 2025.On November 8, JPMorgan analyst Farooq Hanif maintained an Overweight rating on Prudential plc (NYSE:PUK) and raised the price target to 1,500 GBp from 1,450 GBp. In the third quarter, 9 hedge funds were bullish on Prudential plc (NYSE:PUK), compared to 6 in the previous quarter.Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE:LNC), and The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV) are some of the undervalued insurance stocks that provide ample entry points for investors along with Prudential plc (NYSE:PUK).Here is what Third Point Management had to say about Prudential plc in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“During the quarter, Prudential successfully completed its previously announced spin-off of Jackson National and raised additional equity in Asia for the remaining Pru-Asia business. We are pleased to see the value gap begin to close but see considerable additional appreciation potential as Asian-domiciled and other global investors begin to fully appreciate its significant discount to its peers, excellent franchise, and growth potential.”9.

(Nasdaq: SWKS), today announced the evolution of its Si5332 family of high-performance clock generators, supporting the industry transition to PCI Express Generation 6 (PCIe 6.0). According to PCI-SIG, new applications including artificial intelligence, machine learning and edge computing are driving the need for higher performance and increased bandwidth interconnects for compute, switching and storage platforms in data centers1. The Si5332 product family from Skyworks supports PCIe 6.0 while maintaining backwards compatibility with older PCIe standards.""PCIe 6.0 is the future of the data center, and Skyworks is helping IC suppliers design with confidence when they make the transition to the latest PCIe standard,"" said James Wilson, vice president and general manager of timing products at Skyworks. ""Drawing from our decades of expertise in providing high-performance, low-jitter timing solutions for high-speed serial interconnect applications, we have qualified our Si5332 family to provide reference timing for the newest PCIe 6.0 applications.""PCIe 6.0 increases data rates to 64GT/s and enables bandwidths as high as 256Gbps, effectively doubling the performance of PCIe 5.0. This latest upgrade to the PCIe standard ensures the high-speed interconnects used in data center applications do not become a bottleneck and complements the industry’s transition to 400G and 800G Ethernet. Unlike prior generations of the PCIe standard that used NRZ signalling, PCIe 6.0 uses PAM4 modulation to combine two bits into a single symbol with four amplitude levels. This approach doubles the transfer speed but degrades the eye diagram by replacing a single, large data eye with three smaller data eyes. Using a low jitter PCIe reference clock maximizes the PAM4 data eye opening and minimizes bit-error rate, which is necessary for faster transfer speeds.Story continuesThe Si5332’s any-frequency clock synthesis, low jitter operation and support for PCIe 6.0 makes it ideally suited to replace fixed function oscillators, clocks and buffers with a single IC. The device features Skyworks proprietary MultiSynthTM fractional divider technology, which provides any-frequency synthesis and excellent jitter performance. The Si5332 is available in 6, 8 and 12-output options, with support for integrated format/level translation, LVPECL, LVDS, HCSL and LVCMOS, and 1.8-3.3V VDDO operation. When combined with support for PCIe 6.0, the Si5332 is well suited to operate as a data center clock-tree-on-a-chip, replacing multiple timing components with a highly integrated, high-performance solution. Device samples are available now.In addition to this Si5332 product announcement, Skyworks is pleased to announce PCIe 6.0 support in its PCIe Jitter Tool. Long regarded as the industry standard for measuring PCIe clocks and evaluating compliance to PCIe jitter specs, the PCIe Jitter Tool now allows users to take accurate jitter measurements on PCIe 6.0 reference clocks.Skyworks will be exhibiting at the Consumer Electronics Show Booth No. 10850, taking place in Las Vegas from Jan. 5-8, 2023.About SkyworksSkyworks Solutions, Inc. is empowering the wireless networking revolution.

(NASDAQ:ANSS)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-ansys-inc-134623782.html,1671025583,STORY,['ANSS'],"[ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on ANSYS’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for ANSYS What's The Opportunity In ANSYS?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 8.49% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy ANSYS today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $234.61, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since ANSYS’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from ANSYS?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 49% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for ANSYS. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ANSS’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor?

Corporation (NYSE:VFC) And They Just Picked Up 191% More Shares,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-hoplamazian-independent-director-v-103809241.html,1671100689,STORY,['VFC'],"[Potential V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) shareholders may wish to note that the Independent Director, Mark Hoplamazian, recently bought US$491k worth of stock, paying US$28.04 for each share. We reckon that's a good sign, especially since the purchase boosted their holding by 191%. See our latest analysis for V.F The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At V.FNotably, that recent purchase by Mark Hoplamazian is the biggest insider purchase of V.F shares that we've seen in the last year. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$28.04. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 64.50k shares worth US$2.5m. But they sold 677.00 shares for US$34k. Overall, V.F insiders were net buyers during the last year. The average buy price was around US$39.23. I'd consider this a positive as it suggests insiders see value at around the current price. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeV.F is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Insiders own 0.3% of V.F shares, worth about US$38m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About V.F Insiders?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchases. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. Given that insiders also own a fair bit of V.F we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. At Simply Wall St, we've found that V.F has 4 warning signs (2 shouldn't be ignored!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.Of course V.F may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

200,10501230-b7f6-356c-8a6d-7d7d31ea8d7e,VFC,2022-12-15,Our 7 Top Dividend Stock Picks for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-top-dividend-stock-picks-113055314.html,1670844655,STORY,"['ABI', 'VFC', 'CVX', 'PG', 'MCD', 'PSA-PM', 'KMB', 'MO', 'BUD']","[The top dividend stock picks for 2023 are surefire ways for investors to protect themselves against several current issues. Their dividends provide extra returns for portfolios that have been battered in a very difficult 2022. Further, they provide income that can be used to offset the effects of stubbornly-high inflation that continues to eat into finances. In short, dividend-bearing stocks are one of the smartest approaches stock investors have available currently. The same is true in strong economies as well. Dividend stocks tend to perform strongly in all markets which is why a long-term investment perspective benefits considerably from such shares. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsReliable, established companies tend to pay dividends as well, meaning they simply have better business models. And that’s where investors should place their capital. VFCVF Corp $28.20MOAltria $46.71PGProcter &amp; Gamble $150.92CVXChevron $168.00MCDMcDonald’s $272.04KMBKimberly-Clark $136.20PSAPublic Storage $297.60VF Corp (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comVF Corp (NYSE:VFC) stock has had a difficult time in 2022. In fact, it has shed more than 61% of its value year-to-date. That shouldn’t normally inspire much optimism but VF Corp oversees a portfolio of apparel brands that should perform well this holiday season. The company’s brand portfolio includes North Face, Vans, Timberland, Dickies, Supreme and others. Although the company’s earnings have fallen its revenues remain on firm footing for the remainder of the fiscal year. The company anticipates revenues increasing 5-6% this year as long as consumer sentiment doesn’t worsen. So far, that looks to be the case. The National Retail Federation anticipates a healthy holiday season with spending levels 6-8% higher than those in 2021. Its North Face brand has performed well in the first half, with revenues increasing 15% year over year. It stands to reason that North Face products will sell well in the colder months of this holiday season. Yes, VFC has fallen substantially and that is indicative of risk. However, it comes with a 6.03% dividend and could do very well in the next few months.  Story continuesAltria (MO)Altria office sign in Virginia capital city tobacco business closeup by road streetSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.comSin stocks like Altria (NYSE:MO) tend to do well in difficult economic periods. That means the cigarette maker should be experiencing a boost sooner or later. Yet, smoking rates continue to decline after experiencing a dramatic decrease over the last decade. That indicates that Altria, which depends on cigarettes for 90% of revenues, more than its competitors, needs to pivot to remain relevant. It can, and while it does it’ll pay investors a high-yield dividend. In fact, that dividend is the highest on this list, at 8.03%. Investors should be interested in Altria for that dividend and then hope that it can develop products to diversify its revenue. Diversification costs money, thus depending upon resources being directed to such efforts. Fortunately, Altria has options. In 2024, the company will receive a $2.7 billion payment from Phillip Morris (NYSE:PMI) for a product tie-up. It also owns 10% of Anheuser-Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD). It can sell that to fund the development of smokeless products. So, hope for the pivot and take advantage of the dividend. Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Shopping cartProcter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a consumer packaged goods giant proving that certain stocks reliably fare better than others. Case in point: PG shares are down 7% year to date. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen more than 15% during the same period. Procter &amp; Gamble’s performance becomes even more appealing when its dividend is considered. In 2022, Procter &amp; Gamble paid dividends of $3.61 for each share of its stock held. So, when that is considered, PG stock has only fallen by 6% this year, again, much better when compared to the 15% S&amp;P 500 declines. Procter &amp; Gamble’s dividend is ultra-reliable, last having been reduced in 1957. Whatever happens in 2023, investors should understand that Procter &amp; Gamble performs well in any weather. During its most recent financial reporting period, sales increased a modest 1% while EPS declined 2%. That may not sound particularly appealing to investors, but it is far better than many other firms, particularly those in growth sectors like tech. McDonald’s (MCD)McDonald's golden archesSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / ShutterstockPurchasing McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock might put off some investors since discretionary spending tends to fall in weaker economic periods. Consumers spend less where they can and restaurant performance tends to do worse as a result. Inflation tends to get passed on to consumers as well, driving food prices higher. Resulting in yet another reason to dismiss restaurant stocks whether they have a dividend or not. However, McDonald’s operates a franchising business system that makes it somewhat different from the average restaurant stock. McDonald’s profits are padded by franchisee rents and royalties that are calculated from sales. That means McDonald’s can rely on a heavy rental income while also deriving high royalties from its best-performing locations. It’s a clever business model that serves the corporation very well. That means the company will remain well insulated from broad issues into 2023 and beyond. MCD stock is up this year, making it a rare performer. In addition, it pays a 2.22% dividend. Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) has been among the very best-performing stocks in 2022. Volatile energy prices have greatly benefited the oil &amp; gas major resulting in exceptional earnings, especially in the last two quarters. In Q3, Chevron reported $11.2 billion in earnings as higher energy prices positively affected the firm. That represented a significant increase over the $6.1 billion in earnings Chevron reported a year earlier. The strong performance has resulted in share prices that have made a lot of investors a lot of money this year. In short, CVX stock started 2022 at $103 and it now trades above $180. The good news is that analysts believe, by consensus, that CVX stock should trade at $192 moving forward. The good times aren’t over for the company based on EPS projections for Q4. 3 months ago it was expected that Chevron would post EPS figures of $4.48 in Q4. That has steadily risen and now sits at $4.51. Chevron’s dividend pays 3.12% on a forward basis and its 0.32 payout ratio is extremely sustainable for the firm meaning it will pay investors. Kimberly-Clark (KMB)Kimberly Clark (KMB) sign, positioned outside the world headquarters’ main entrance.Source: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.comKimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) stock has fallen a modest 4.4% throughout 2022, proving that non-durable consumer staples continue to be a wise investment. Including Kimberly-Clark’s dividend, the stock has declined less than 1% throughout the year. Back to the notion that non-durable consumer staples make for good investments. Consumer staples are goods that can be considered essential products for consumers. The category includes food and drinks, household goods, and hygiene products like those that Kimberly-Clark sells. Kimberly-Clark sells leading paper towel brands including Cottonelle, Scott and Viva. It also sells hygiene products under leading names including Huggies, Kleenex and Depends. Consumer demand for such goods remains stable no matter the economic conditions. Consumers do trade down, however, Kimberly-Clark has value offerings to address that fluctuation.   The first nine months of 2022 saw revenues increase 5% to $15.211 billion. And despite rising costs across the board, net income only declined a modest 2%. Public Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comPublic Storage (NYSE:PSA) stock benefits from a potential tailwind in 2023 that isn’t nice to consider but may happen nonetheless. That scenario is worth considering and makes it attractive in addition to its 2.7% dividend which hasn’t been reduced since 1992. Public Storage operates more than 200 million square feet of self-storage space across the U.S. Let’s assume a 2023 recession occurs as the majority of economists expect. That will lead to increased rates of homelessness as rents become untenable. People will move their belongings into storage units while they look to improve their situations. That hypothetical situation benefits Public Storage. Even without such an unfortunate tailwind, Public Storage is doing well. Rental income increased 15.2% in the third quarter, reaching $795.7 million. Total revenue increased by a similar 15.4% during the same period. Share prices have fallen from $365 to begin 2022. The company increased its footprint by 25% during the most recent quarter and maintains the highest operating margins in the self-storage industry making 2023 look strong. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this biggest U.S. mortgage lender have returned -8.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, which Wells Fargo falls in, has lost 6.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Wells Fargo is expected to post earnings of $1.26 per share, indicating a change of -8.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.77 points to a change of -23.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.05 indicates a change of +34% from what Wells Fargo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Wells Fargo.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WFC _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Wells Fargo, the consensus sales estimate of $19.89 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -4.6%. The $74.04 billion and $81.52 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -5.1% and +10.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWells Fargo reported revenues of $19.51 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.6%. EPS of $1.30 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.72 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.22%. The EPS surprise was +19.27%.Over the last four quarters, Wells Fargo surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Wells Fargo is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Wells Fargo. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It reported just 20,957 new COVID cases in the past 24 hours, likely as a result of its change in reporting.Cases had been surging before China relaxed measures, probably owing in part to widespread COVID policy protests that may have served as “super-spreader” events.Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization’s health emergencies program, said Wednesday that China’s easing of lockdowns isn’t responsible for its current surge.“There’s a narrative at the moment that China lifted the restrictions and all of a sudden, the disease is out of control,” he said at a press conference in Geneva, multiple news outlets reported.“The disease was spreading intensively because, I believe, the control measures in themselves were not stopping the disease. And I believe China decided strategically that was not the best option anymore.”Experts have urged China to let outside experts like those with the WHO advise its transition, as well as to allow better vaccines like those from Pfizer and Moderna. In a sign of progress, Maria Van Kerkhove, a technical lead for the WHO’s COVID-19 response, said Wednesday that the agency was providing advice to the country regarding the relaxing of restrictions, Reuters reported Wednesday.And earlier this week, China’s Meheco Group said it had struck a deal with Pfizer to import its COVID-19 vaccine, Reuters reported. China has domestically developed vaccines, but data on their effectiveness is lacking. The same company will also soon sell Pfizer’s anti-COVID drug Paxlovid in China, Bloomberg reported Wednesday.Story continuesBecause China lacks “population immunity” owing to a widespread lack of exposure, subpar vaccines, and low vaccination rates among the elderly, the virus will likely rip through the country, causing “hundreds of millions” of infections, Ali Mokdad, a professor at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, recently told Fortune.“If you look at the numbers, only about 25% of those in China have immunity against Omicron,” he told Fortune earlier this month, before the country’s reopening. “If they open up, 75% of the population is going to get infected. They cannot handle the explosion in infections and hospitalizations.”“This will spread like wildfire.”Earlier this month Ryan said he hoped the Chinese would find a new approach to battling COVID that “balances the control of the virus with the lives, livelihoods, and well-being of the people of China,” he said.“When you can’t stop a fire, you get people in danger out of the way,” he told Fortune. “And in this case, we do that with the vaccine.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:  Rishi Sunak’s old hedge fund boss paid himself $1.9 million a day this year Meet the 29-year-old teacher with four degrees who wants to join the Great Resignation How much money you need to earn to buy a $400,000 home Elon Musk ‘wanted to punch’ Kanye West after deeming the rapper’s swastika tweet an ‘incitement to violence’ ]"

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Fox The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.14bUS$2.03bUS$2.34bUS$1.95bUS$2.08bUS$2.07bUS$2.08bUS$2.10bUS$2.12bUS$2.15bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x13Analyst x13Analyst x10Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ -0.28%Est @ 0.39%Est @ 0.87%Est @ 1.20%Est @ 1.44% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$2.0kUS$1.8kUS$1.9kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$14bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.0%) = US$40bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$40b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$19bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$34b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$32.0, the company appears quite good value at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Fox as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.985. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.89% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 0.89% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Paypal as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.19, up 7.21% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.39 billion, up 6.83% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.08 per share and revenue of $27.53 billion, which would represent changes of -11.3% and +8.49%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Paypal should also be noted by investors.

Adding PayPal to MetaMask could broaden the customer base for some of these applications by removing the complexity from buying crypto.“This integration with PayPal will allow our U.S. users to not just buy crypto seamlessly through MetaMask, but also to easily explore the Web3 ecosystem,” MetaMask product manager Lorenzo Santos said in the statement.PayPal has embraced crypto in several ways over the past few years.

O’Higgins in his 1991 book titled ‘Beating the Dow’. The strategy focuses on the highest dividend-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). In addition to this, the strategy’s main aim is to generate higher returns than DJIA by investing in high-yielding stocks at the end of the calendar year. This year’s economic situation has turned investors’ attention toward these securities as they can help them to generate stable income.Over the years, the Dogs of the Dow have generated positive returns for shareholders, becoming investors’ top choice in periods of slow economic growth. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, the Dogs returned 34.3% in 2013 through December 26, compared with a 28.9% return of the Dow during the same period. The report also mentioned that the strategy beat the market through much of the 1970s and 1980s. Another report by CNBC threw light on the positive returns of the Dogs. The report stated that the strategy has beaten the Dow in ten of the 15 years from 2000 to 2015 by an average of about 1.3%. In 2015, the DJIA delivered a 2% return to shareholders, while the Dogs returned 4%.This year’s returns also showed the supremacy of the Dogs over the broader market. As of October 28, the Dogs fell by 0.3%, compared with a 17.10% decline in the S&amp;P 500 and an 8.20% drop in the DJIA, as reported by Horan Associates.

If you want to see more best blue chip stocks that outperformed in 2022, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.2022 has been a challenging year for the markets as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates substantially to fight inflation. As a result of the interest rate increases, demand for some companies have weakened and valuations in the overall market have decreased as capital has moved from equities to Treasuries.With the headwinds, all three of the major market indexes have declined year to date in 2022 with the S&amp;P 500 down 16.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 6.77%, and the tech heavy Nasdaq down 28.9%.Of the three indexes, it's not surprising that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen the least given that the index is comprised of blue chip stocks.Blue chip stocks are stocks of well-known leading companies with substantial competitive advantages. Many blue chips have strong histories of increasing earnings over time and returning capital back to shareholders through dividends or stock repurchases.While the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have blue chip stocks as well, the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ index include many medium sized and smaller companies that the Dow Jones Industrial Average doesn't.November Inflation DataWhile the three indexes are down this year, the market has rallied since October as inflation has shown signs of potentially peaking.For the month of November, the consumer price index rose 7.1% year over year versus estimates of an increase of 7.3% year over year. Meanwhile, the core CPI rose only 6% year over year on an annual basis versus estimates of 6.1% year over year. The better than expected inflation numbers for November followed better than expected numbers for October as well.Given the recent inflation numbers, it remains to be seen what the Federal Reserve will do in the near term as the U.S. central bank has said one month of good data isn't enough.Story continuesFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in November, ""While October inflation data received so far showed a welcome surprise to the downside, these are a single month's data, which followed upside surprises over the previous two months. As figure 1 makes clear, down months in the data have often been followed by renewed increases. It will take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining. By any standard, inflation remains much too high.""If two months isn't good enough either and the Federal Reserve raises rates too much, it could slow the economy and cause a recession next year. If economic data fails to meet expectations, there could be more downside.If rates don't go up too much further, however, the economic slowdown might not be as bad as expected. Given the market decline so far, the stocks of some quality blue chips could trade for attractive valuations in the long term as a result.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks That Outperformed in 2022, we took 12 of the best performing Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks in terms of their year to date performance.We then ranked them based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Best Blue Chip Stocks That Outperformed in 202212.

227,ecf0ec76-e851-3478-88cc-047f39b8f1d2,GM,2022-12-15,YEARENDER-Electric vehicles confront the leap to the mass market,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yearender-electric-vehicles-confront-leap-120000621.html,1671105600,STORY,"['TSLA', 'F', 'GM']","[By Joseph WhiteDETROIT, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The past year was sobering for investors who poured money into Tesla Inc and rival electric vehicle startups that hoped to emulate Tesla CEO Elon Musk's success.As interest rates rose and financial markets gyrated, shares in many EV startups deflated. Rivian Automotive Inc, which had a higher market value than Ford Motor Co shortly after it went public in 2021, lost more than 70% of its value over the past year.Other EV startups fared worse. Electric van maker Arrival warned it could run out of cash in less than a year. Lucid Group Inc, backed by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, struggled to build its sleek Air luxury EVs. Chinese Tesla challenger Xpeng Inc's shares lost more than 80% of their value.Now comes the hard part: Persauding more mainstream consumers to come along for the ride.WHY IT MATTERSThe automobile industry is pouring more than $1 trillion into a revolutionary shift from combustion engines to electric vehicles guided by software. From Detroit to Shanghai, automakers and government policymakers have embraced the promise of electric vehicles to provide cleaner, safer transportation. European countries and California have set 2035 as the deadline for ending sales of new combustion passenger vehicles.Tesla Inc's surge to become the world's most valuable automaker - achieving a $1 trillion valuation last year - humbled established automakers such as Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG that once were reluctant to go electric.Starting next year, a wave of new electric vehicles from pickup trucks to middle market SUVs and sedans will hit the world's major markets.Industry executives and forecasters do not agree on how rapidly electric vehicles could take over half the global vehicle market, let alone all of it.In China, the world's largest single automotive market, battery electric vehicles have captured about 21% of the market. In Europe, EVs account for about 12% of total passenger vehicle sales. But in the United States, EV market share is only about 6%.Story continuesAmong the barriers to EV adoption, industry executives and analysts said, were a dearth of public fast-charging infrastructure, and the rising cost of EV batteries, driven by shortages of key materials and uncertainty over government subsidies that have buoyed EV purchases in major markets including the United States, China and Europe.By 2029, electric vehicles could account for a third of the North American market, and about 26% of vehicles produced worldwide, according to AutoForecast Solutions, a consultancy.Electric vehicle sales likely will not increase in a smooth, ever-ascending curve, said AFS President Joe McCabe. If there is a recession next year, as many economists forecast, that will slow EV adoption.Wards Intelligence forecasts that combustion vehicles will make up just under 80% of North American sales in 2027. Based on automakers' product plans, Wards analyst Haig Stoddard said at a recent conference that manufacturers ""expect strong ICE (internal combustion engine) volume heading into the next decade.""WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR 2023?Throughout 2022, established automakers such as Mercedes, Ford and General Motors Co unveiled dozens of new electric vehicles to challenge Tesla and the upstarts.Mass production of most of these vehicles kicks into gear starting in 2023 and 2024.By 2025, there could be 74 different electric vehicle models offered in North America, McCabe said. But he predicts fewer than 20% of those models are likely to sell at volumes above 50,000 vehicles a year. Automakers could be stuck with too many niche models and too much capacity.Slowing economies threaten overall vehicle demand in Europe and China, too.During the early years of the 20th Century, new auto companies sprang up, backed by investors eager to catch the wave of mass mobility that Henry Ford and other automotive pioneers started. By the 1950s, the global auto industry had consolidated and once-heralded brands such as Duesenberg had disappeared.The next few years will determine whether the 21st Century's crop of electric vehicle brands will follow a similar path.Explore the Reuters round-up of news stories that dominated the year, and the outlook for 2023.

(UAL) has placed a massive aircraft order in commercial aviation history. The U.S. carrier ordered 100 new Boeing 787 Dreamliners, with options to purchase 100 more. UAL anticipates getting delivery of the new widebody planes between 2024 and 2032.United Airlines is also purchasing 100 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, with 44 expected to be delivered between 2024 and 2026 and 56 more MAX aircraft between 2027 and 2028.UAL expects delivery of almost 700 new narrow and widebody aircraft by 2032, including an average of more than two every week in 2023 and more than three every week in 2024.These latest aircraft orders reflect United Airlines’ investment in its future fleet and initiatives toward fleet modernization and global growth strategy. Notably, the carrier has been constantly making efforts to improvise the interiors of its existing fleet. More than 90% of UAL’s international wide bodies are equipped with the United Polaris business class seat and United Premium Plus seating. The remaining upgrade for the aircraft should get completed by 2023 summer.Almost 100 planes of the new widebody order are likely to replace older Boeing 767 and Boeing 777 aircraft, with all 767 aircraft removed from the United Airlines fleet by 2030. This should reduce carbon emissions per seat for the new planes by nearly 25% decrease, as compared to the older planes.As a result, UAL is likely to get a boost in achieving its target of being 100% green by completely reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 without relying on traditional carbon offsets. To this end, UAL is also encouraging more fuel-efficient aircraft into its fleet and investing in sustainable aviation fuel and other decarbonization technologies.The 787 Dreamliner comes with better efficiency and flexibility across its extensive network of domestic and international flights and provides a 25% improvement in fuel usage compared with the airplanes it replaces. The 737 MAX unit also brings improved fuel efficiency in the single-aisle market and lessens fuel usage and CO2 emissions by 20% compared to the airplanes it replaces.Story continuesUnited Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, stated, ""This order further solidifies our lead and creates new opportunities for our customers, employees and shareholders by accelerating our plan to connect more people to more places around the globe and deliver the best experience in the sky.""Apart from the aforementioned fleet modernization efforts, this aircraft order is also expected to create huge job opportunities for pilots, flight attendants, maintenance technicians and other related airport operations. UAL has hired 15,000 people in 2022 and is on track to add more 15,000 next year.Kate Gebo, United Airlines EVP of Human Resources and Labor Relations, stated, “We're not just creating jobs – these are long-lasting careers that offer great pay, outstanding benefits and flight privileges to see the world.

(NASDAQ:ISRG)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-intuitive-surgical-120027721.html,1671105627.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG). The company's stock saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Intuitive Surgical’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical Is Intuitive Surgical Still Cheap?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Intuitive Surgical’s ratio of 71.97x is above its peer average of 33.96x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Medical Equipment industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Intuitive Surgical’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Intuitive Surgical?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 56% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Intuitive Surgical.

If you want to read about some more aluminum companies, go directly to 5 Biggest Aluminum Companies In The World.Aluminum is one of the most abundant metallic elements in the Earth’s crust. It possesses many properties, being durable, malleable, strong, lightweight, flexible, and resistant to corrosion and oxidation. It also has high reflectivity and excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. It is widely used in the manufacturing of many important automobile parts, like wheels, engines, chassis, and other parts of modern cars. Globally, it is also used to produce smartphones, tablets, personal computers (PCs), refrigerators, and other electronic items.The market growth in the aluminum sector can be attributed to the extensive use of the metal in different industries across the globe. For instance, in addition to being important for electronics and cars, it is employed in the food and beverage industry for making packaging containers, in the cosmetics industry for packing and protecting cosmetic products, in the production of different dosage forms of medications, including capsules, creams, lotions, liquid, and powders, and other pharma products. The aluminum market, like other sectors of the economy, was severely affected by the COVID-19 crisis. However, since then, demand for cars and electronics have skyrocketed. The aluminum industry has not taken full advantage of this rise in demand since the onset of inflation following the market recovery has resulted in a shortage of workers in the manufacturing sectors, in tandem with a fall in demand from the aerospace and automotive industries. The rising consumption of packaged foods is offsetting this to some extent. Despite the near-term headwinds, it is expected that the aluminum market will rise in the coming years. Conservative estimates of the aluminum market size before the end of this decade place it around $277 billion, predicting a compound annual growth rate of more than 5.6%. Some of the top firms working in the aluminum sector include Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), among others discussed in detail below. Story continuesOur MethodologyThese were picked from a careful assessment of the aluminum industry.

The current price of aluminum is unsustainably low, below its cost of production, despite inventories being at historic lows. We believe these depressed prices are due to the evaporation of Chinese demand resulting from its zero COVID-19 policy, but that it will likely recover over the next few quarters.Additionally, Alcoa is leading the industry in reducing carbon emissions from its smelting process which is helping to improve its cost position relative to global competitors. Given its compelling valuation and strong free cash flow yield, we are confident in the company as it is increasingly relied upon to meet the growing structural demand from electrification and the global energy transition.”8.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ETBitcoin Seesaws but Holds at $17.8KBy James RubinBitcoin looked primed to continue its momentum this week before U.S. central bank Chair Jerome Powell damped investors' mood with a pointed reminder that the Fed was not finished with its monetary hawkishness even after lowering its latest interest rate hike to 50 basis points.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $17,811, roughly where it stood 24 hours earlier. BTC had topped $18,300 earlier in the day following an unexpected slowing in November's inflation data and the Fed's anticipated dovish turn. But in a press conference following the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) rate announcement, Powell returned to a months-long theme that rising prices presented the biggest threat to the economy.“50 basis points is still a historically large increase and we still have some ways to go,” Powell said at a press conference following the FOMC statement.Ether followed a similar pattern, rising earlier in the day before dropping to trade at $1,308, down about a percentage point from Tuesday, same time. Most other major cryptocurrencies were in the red, albeit not by much with UNI, the token of decentralized exchange Uniswap, and LINK, the token of software platform Chainlink, falling 3.2% and 3.1%, respectively.The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently sank 0.33%.Story continuesEquity indexes troubled by Powell's comments closed down with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 off 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Tuesday's consumer price index fell to 7.1%, lower than the 7.3% projected by economists responding to a FactSet survey.The Fed's latest rate increase the federal funds target range to 4.25%-4.5%, the highest level in 15 years. Powell has signaled that the terminal rate – the peak rate for the current hiking cycle, expected sometime next year – will likely be over 5%. The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge each other to borrow and lend money.Meanwhile, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) are introducing a bill to crack down on money laundering and financing of terrorists and rogue nations via cryptocurrency. The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act would bring know-your-customer (KYC) rules to crypto participants such as wallet providers and miners and prohibit financial institutions from transacting with digital asset mixers, which are tools designed to obscure the origin of funds.Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, noted in an email that the current Congress, which is in its final weeks, is unlikely to pass the legislation, but that ""the Act would address some national security concerns as it requires crypto firms to play by the same rules that apply to banks and traditional firms.""Biggest GainersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorSolanaSOL+1.7%Smart Contract PlatformBitcoinBTC+0.2%CurrencyBiggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorGalaGALA−3.2%EntertainmentDogecoinDOGE−3.0%CurrencyChainlinkLINK−2.9%ComputingInsights'Dr. Copper' Offers Encouragement for Bitcoin InvestorsBy Glenn Williams Jr.Bitcoin’s correlation with copper, which moved into positive territory following the Thanksgiving holiday, has continued to rise.The increase is significant, given copper’s traditional link to economic health. Analysts often view copper as a proxy for growth, affectionately calling it “Dr. Copper” for its professorial ability to forecast trends. So copper doing well bodes well for the economy, which bodes well for bitcoin.(TradingView)Markets have been looking favorably upon copper, with the price of its futures contract increasing 8% over the last three weeks. If historic relationships hold true, this trend would imply market confidence about U.S. economic prospects.By contrast, bitcoin (BTC) has maintained a strong negative correlation with the U.S. Dollar index (DXY). Investors will be watching this index in the weeks ahead, particularly after the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) trimmed its interest rate hike to 50 basis points on Wednesday from its previous, more aggressive 75 bps increases.Still, Fed Chair Jerome Powell was unexpectedly hawkish in his comments following the rate announcement, reiterating long-held concerns about inflation.Will bitcoin follow Dr. Copper’s prescription or follow the lead of the U.S. Dollar Index?

Both instruments were still trading up 0.6% for the week.Prices of the yellow metal retreated slightly on Wednesday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that U.S. interest rates were likely to peak at higher-than-expected levels, even as the central bank hiked rates by a relatively smaller 50 basis points (bps) and outlined a slower pace of hikes.Rising interest rates were the biggest headwind to gold markets this year, as they drove up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. With Wednesday’s hike, the Fed has raised its benchmark rate by 425 basis points this year, putting it at its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis.While this did make a dent in inflation, pulling it further away from a 40-year high, inflation still remains well above the central bank’s annual target of 2%. Powell cited this as the main driver of higher-than-expected interest rates.The Fed also reiterated that it is willing to dampen U.S. economic growth and the job market in order to bring down inflation.“While the market may view inflation as being in its death throes, the Fed certainly does not. For the Fed to relax it will want to see substantial evidence that inflation is slowing, not just one or two months where core inflation has come in less than the market was expecting,” analysts at ING wrote in a note.Other precious metals were also muted, while risk-driven assets such as stocks and currencies retreated.Story continuesAmong industrial metals, copper prices retreated on Thursday amid continued uncertainty over a Chinese economic reopening.

The Fed raised interest rates by half a percentage point and projected at least an additional 75 basis points of increases in borrowing costs by the end of 2023 as well as a rise in unemployment and a near stalling of economic growth in the world's largest economy. ""At the moment, the buck is slightly up since the Fed will indeed continue to hike interest rates, and are expected to go to over 5.0% by the time they are done. Moves going forward will be very data-dependent and I expect Powell to lean on that for an uncertain 2023,"" said Juan Perez, director of trading at Monex. ""BRL, MXN and LATAM all seem to be slightly weaker, but we feel there will be other economic variables at play that will improve currencies against the buck even with a hawkish, yet predictable Fed."" Risky assets of emerging markets have taken a hit but investors expect EM to hold up against developed markets next year with an HSBC survey predicting a ""distinct improvement"" in investor sentiment, led by Latin America. Brazil's real slid 0.4% after data showed economic activity contracted in October as aggressive interest-rate hikes to battle inflation took a toll on growth. Incoming Finance Minister Fernando Haddad has promised to move up the timeline on new fiscal rules, seen as crucial to sort out public finances, but has not committed to any dates. Haddad also downplayed possible changes to the country's State-Owned Enterprise Law to make it easier for politicians to take roles at state-run firms, saying effective auditing from the federal government is more important. President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, meanwhile, appointed Workers Party (PT) veteran Aloizio Mercadante to run the development bank BNDES. ""The appointment of Mercadante for BNDES raises concerns that the subsided credit loans policy implemented in the past could resume,"" Citigroup strategists said in a note. Political unrest continued to weigh on the Peruvian sol . Peru's defense minister announced a nationwide state of emergency , which will take effect in the next few hours and allow soldiers to assist police in maintaining public safety after a week of fiery protests and road blockades sparked by the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo. ""The unrest is already causing economic damage, and the fallout will be even larger if protests start to impact mining activity,"" said Kimberley Sperrfechter, EM economist at Capital Economics. Peru's is the world second largest producer of copper. The Supreme Court is considering the prosecution's request for up to 18 months of preventative arrest for Castillo after he was charged with rebellion and conspiracy. Peru's new government is looking at economic stimulus measures for regions roiled by protests, but will hold steady to ""non-negotiable"" fiscal deficit targets, the economy minister said. If the government loosens purse strings, that could put Peru's public finances under strain, while sustained protests could lead to shortages, which would force the central bank to stay restrictive as inflation will likely pick up, she said.

262,f86649ac-15de-3ce4-81fe-e1c9eac9417c,KLAC,2022-12-15,When Should You Buy KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-kla-corporation-nasdaq-klac-104756092.html,1671101276,STORY,['KLAC'],"[Let's talk about the popular KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC). The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine KLA’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for KLA Is KLA Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 2.46% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy KLA today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $396.47, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because KLA’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from KLA?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of KLA, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 5.4%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in KLAC’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on KLAC, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with KLA, and understanding these should be part of your investment process.If you are no longer interested in KLA, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

Verizon customers will get Netflix premium free for a year if they subscribe to another service through its new streaming marketplace. Now this is all according to the Wall Street Journal. You'll need to buy a yearlong or season-long subscription through Plus Play, which allows customers to manage all their subscriptions in one spot. The services included in the deal include NFL+ Premium, NBA League Pass, the meditation app Calm, the Peloton app, the language learning app Duolingo, and AMC's streaming service AMC+.Now a recent JD Power survey showed 60% of Americans had at least four streaming services. That's up from 40% just two years ago, hence the need for this. This move attempts to simplify the managing of all those various streaming services. So let's check out the stocks. Verizon just down, well, slightly, about 1%. Netflix also a slight trim. Neither reacted to the story, needless to say, but it is an interesting partnership, teaming up in this.JOSH SCHAFER: What stuck out to me there, Dave, is middleman between streamers and customers-- that sounds like cable, right, and where we've been before in some ways. I understand it's streaming, and we're creating a middleman there. But I feel like we're working in a little bit of a circle here. And I'm curious just what consumer demand is going to be for this product. Would I rather do that or just have all these on my smart TV? Do I need Verizon here to help me? I'm not really sure--DAVE BRIGGS: [INAUDIBLE] free year of premium Netflix.JOSH SCHAFER: But does it gain you new customers?SEANA SMITH: How sticky is that?JOSH SCHAFER: Does it gain you new customers and extended revenue year over year? Or does it just bring you in the first year? Maybe it does.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: I just think no.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I think-- I have a hard time believing that this is going to work out in the long run, just as someone who I have Fios. I also have a number of streaming services. I think it would be very convenient. I'm not willing, though, to pay more every single year in order to have this luxury. So I get the payoff in the beginning. You're going to get Netflix and a couple of other streaming things for free. I don't know if that's going to be enough to make that customer pretty sticky, but we'll see.DAVE BRIGGS: Managing them all in one spot sounds appealing to this guy.]"

268,4c5fe456-f155-3e0e-bf9c-4cebd48eabaf,VZ,2022-12-15,Investors Heavily Search Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-verizon-communications-140002751.html,1671026402,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned +0.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless National industry, which Verizon falls in, has lost 1.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.22 per share, indicating a change of -6.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.19 points to a change of -3.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.10 indicates a change of -1.7% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Verizon.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VZ _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Verizon, the consensus sales estimate of $35.17 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.2%. The $136.77 billion and $139.02 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.4% and +1.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $34.24 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4%. EPS of $1.32 for the same period compares with $1.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.78 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.36%. The EPS surprise was +3.13%.Over the last four quarters, Verizon surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, NVIDIA's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on NVIDIA.How Is NVIDIA's Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as NVIDIA's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 28% decrease to the company's bottom line. Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 144% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would probably welcome the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 19% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.1% per year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we can see why NVIDIA is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Final WordWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesWe've established that NVIDIA maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.It is also worth noting that we have found 3 warning signs for NVIDIA that you need to take into consideration.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than NVIDIA.

If you want to read about some more stocks that members of Congress own, go directly to 5 Stocks That Members of Congress Own.It is no secret that stock trading has generally been considered a side-benefit to winning a seat in the United States Congress. Although these trades by lawmakers were not available to the public for scrutiny before, they have been since 2012, as the STOCK Act of 2012 mandates that lawmakers disclose these trades publicly. An analysis of these trades by the New York Times has found that at least 97 current members of Congress bought or sold stock, bonds or other financial assets that intersected with their congressional work. It is important to clarify that US lawmakers are not banned from investing in any company, including those companies that could be affected by their decisions. However, such calls have grown in the past few years as the trading activities of lawmakers become controversial. Public outrage over congressional stock trading intensified in recent years after revelations that four senators had sold stocks in 2020 after private briefings on the risks of a coronavirus outbreak in the United States. Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in September 2022 that she would support a floor vote on legislation that would ban members of Congress and their family members from dealing in individual stocks while those lawmakers are in office. Pelosi had earlier gone against such a vote. Some of the top stocks that US Congress members presently own include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), among others. The US Congress has postponed a vote regarding the ban on stock trading for lawmakers until after the midterm elections. Photo by MIKE STOLL on UnsplashOur MethodologyThe companies listed below were picked from the Periodic Transaction Report(s) that US politicians who trade stocks are obliged to file. It is important to clarify that the stocks listed below were picked from the public record of investments Congress members and their families have made in the past few months. The purchases may not have been made by the members themselves but only disclosed on behalf of their families. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continuesStocks That Members of Congress Own15.

Accenture modestly lagged the market last quarter and became similarly attractive enough to warrant ownership.

Airbnb is the clear market leader in private rental bookings globally, according to market research firm Euromonitor. The business is currently firing on all cylinders, with revenue and earnings growth well above our expectations and long-term estimates. It would be easy to say that it is because as the world reopens, people are traveling for the first time in two years, providing a short-term benefit to the company. But, Airbnb also grew quickly in 2021 when people were still hesitant to travel and preferred staying close to home. The company’s growth in 2022 is not an easy comparison like it is for online travel agencies (which are more hotel-oriented), airlines, and hotels. Airbnb’s business has outpaced the hotel industry growth by more than 1,250 basis points per year since 2019, showing far more resilience than hotels and online travel agencies.Airbnb didn’t invent the private rental market, but it developed a better offering and helped it scale with robust network effects and a system of trust protecting travelers and hosts alike.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Nvidia (NVDA).Nvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.61, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.61 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 64.3% and 10.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDABroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NVDACheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Nvidia here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Nvidia, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in NVDA?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 8.6% over the past month to $3.27.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Nvidia. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Nvidia with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To skip the detailed analysis of the insurance industry, go directly to the 5 Undervalued Insurance Stocks to Buy Now.Insurance is one of the largest industries in the world. An estimated $5.5 trillion worth of insurance premiums were written in 2021, which puts the industry’s market value ahead of the GDP of all countries except the US and Canada. The US has the largest insurance market in the world. In 2021, the country's total written premiums were over $2.7 trillion, which was more than its next 8 competing countries combined.Insurance Market Analysis in the Third QuarterThe US Insurance Composite Renewal Rate increased by 5% in Q3 compared to 10% in the prior quarter. Property insurance pricing surged for the 20th consecutive quarter. In Q3, it increased by 8% compared to 6% in the previous quarter. Moreover, casualty insurance pricing went up by 3%, cyber insurance by 48% and financial and professional lines declined by 6% compared to an increase of 21% in the prior quarter.In the quarter, Hurricane Ian and Fiona proved to be quite disruptive for the insurance companies. The catastrophe losses for insurance companies are estimated to be $50-$70 billion from Hurricane Ian alone. The residents of Florida already pay triple the average national amount of insurance premium at $4,321 per year, and the recent Hurricane Ian destruction might lead the insurers to either increase their premiums or cease operations in the state altogether.Insurance Industry: Current Trends and ForecastsThe insurance industry is growing at a substantially fast pace. The market of the industry was valued at $4.47 trillion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 63% to $224.34 trillion by 2028.Rising interest rates usually fare well for insurance companies as the portfolio yields rise, leading to increased investment earnings for insurers. Keeping that in mind, Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE:LNC), and The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV) are of some the undervalued insurance stocks that one should keep an eye on.Story continuesJonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyAfter carefully analyzing the insurance stocks listed on NYSE and NASDAQ, we chose these 10 stocks based on their past performance, growth prospects, dividend history, and analyst ratings. The stocks on the list are either trading at a PE ratio below the industry average of 18.6x at the time of writing or have certain growth catalysts that make the company undervalued.The stocks were listed in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds.Undervalued Insurance Stocks to Buy Now10. Prudential plc (NYSE:PUK)Number of Hedge Fund holders: 9Prudential plc (NYSE:PUK) is a British insurance company that started as a lending company in the 19th century. Although with its PE ratio of 16.78, the company seems to be fairly valued compared to the insurance industry average. However, the company’s growth prospects make it an undervalued company.Prudential plc (NYSE:PUK) is expanding to Asia and Africa. The two continents have more significant growth catalysts due to a high addressable market and low penetration of insurance companies. Prudential plc (NYSE:PUK) expects its customer base to increase from 17 million in 2021 to 50 million by 2025.On November 8, JPMorgan analyst Farooq Hanif maintained an Overweight rating on Prudential plc (NYSE:PUK) and raised the price target to 1,500 GBp from 1,450 GBp. In the third quarter, 9 hedge funds were bullish on Prudential plc (NYSE:PUK), compared to 6 in the previous quarter.Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI), Lincoln National Corporation (NYSE:LNC), and The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV) are some of the undervalued insurance stocks that provide ample entry points for investors along with Prudential plc (NYSE:PUK).Here is what Third Point Management had to say about Prudential plc in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“During the quarter, Prudential successfully completed its previously announced spin-off of Jackson National and raised additional equity in Asia for the remaining Pru-Asia business. We are pleased to see the value gap begin to close but see considerable additional appreciation potential as Asian-domiciled and other global investors begin to fully appreciate its significant discount to its peers, excellent franchise, and growth potential.”9.

(NASDAQ:BRP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“BRP Group (NASDAQ:BRP) operates as one of largest middle market insurance brokers in a highly fragmented domestic market. Historically, insurance brokerage has been very resilient in economic downturns. Their unique acquisition strategy in a highly fragmented industry should lead to above-average growth for many years. We also like BRP’s organic growth characteristics due to their exposure in middle market brokerage. BRP has attractive margins with room for meaningful expansion. The market selloff gave us an opportunity to initiate this new investment at very attractive prices. We estimate BRP’s private market value to be $35.”8.

The plan’s main goals are to diversify the company’s assets into a broader array of investments, including private debt through strategic partnerships, and to increase its use of reinsurance to free up capital. We think this is an interesting, but somewhat aggressive plan. Thus far, the results have been impressive, but we continue to monitor the credit quality of their assets as they move toward achieving their target of having 40% of their portfolio invested in private assets, up from 15.4%.”7.

If you want to see more best blue chip stocks that outperformed in 2022, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.2022 has been a challenging year for the markets as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates substantially to fight inflation. As a result of the interest rate increases, demand for some companies have weakened and valuations in the overall market have decreased as capital has moved from equities to Treasuries.With the headwinds, all three of the major market indexes have declined year to date in 2022 with the S&amp;P 500 down 16.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 6.77%, and the tech heavy Nasdaq down 28.9%.Of the three indexes, it's not surprising that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen the least given that the index is comprised of blue chip stocks.Blue chip stocks are stocks of well-known leading companies with substantial competitive advantages. Many blue chips have strong histories of increasing earnings over time and returning capital back to shareholders through dividends or stock repurchases.While the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have blue chip stocks as well, the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ index include many medium sized and smaller companies that the Dow Jones Industrial Average doesn't.November Inflation DataWhile the three indexes are down this year, the market has rallied since October as inflation has shown signs of potentially peaking.For the month of November, the consumer price index rose 7.1% year over year versus estimates of an increase of 7.3% year over year. Meanwhile, the core CPI rose only 6% year over year on an annual basis versus estimates of 6.1% year over year. The better than expected inflation numbers for November followed better than expected numbers for October as well.Given the recent inflation numbers, it remains to be seen what the Federal Reserve will do in the near term as the U.S. central bank has said one month of good data isn't enough.Story continuesFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in November, ""While October inflation data received so far showed a welcome surprise to the downside, these are a single month's data, which followed upside surprises over the previous two months. As figure 1 makes clear, down months in the data have often been followed by renewed increases. It will take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining. By any standard, inflation remains much too high.""If two months isn't good enough either and the Federal Reserve raises rates too much, it could slow the economy and cause a recession next year. If economic data fails to meet expectations, there could be more downside.If rates don't go up too much further, however, the economic slowdown might not be as bad as expected. Given the market decline so far, the stocks of some quality blue chips could trade for attractive valuations in the long term as a result.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks That Outperformed in 2022, we took 12 of the best performing Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks in terms of their year to date performance.We then ranked them based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Best Blue Chip Stocks That Outperformed in 202212.

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Fox The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.14bUS$2.03bUS$2.34bUS$1.95bUS$2.08bUS$2.07bUS$2.08bUS$2.10bUS$2.12bUS$2.15bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x13Analyst x13Analyst x10Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ -0.28%Est @ 0.39%Est @ 0.87%Est @ 1.20%Est @ 1.44% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$2.0kUS$1.8kUS$1.9kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$14bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.0%) = US$40bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$40b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$19bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$34b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$32.0, the company appears quite good value at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Fox as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.985. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221215005096/en/Credit: Julian Klincewicz and Walt Disney Animation StudiosAs The Walt Disney Company commemorates its 100th anniversary in 2023, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit has emerged from the Disney vault to re-enter the pop culture zeitgeist ahead of the Year of the Rabbit. Created by Walt Disney and his studio artists, and known as the clever and fun-loving precursor to Mickey Mouse, Oswald is a first in the history of character animation. Earlier this month, Walt Disney Animation Studios debuted an all-new Oswald short for the first time in nearly 95 years.Givenchy Creative Director Matthew M. Williams sources inspiration from around the globe, from New York and Paris to Los Angeles, Shanghai, Tokyo and beyond. For this collaboration, the designer worked with Disney to create a ""one-of-a-kind world tour"" that fuses Oswald’s mischievous, high-energy spirit with his own directional aesthetic for Givenchy, in a capsule of collectible statement pieces that capture the spirit of adventure.The campaign and Oswald’s world tour will come to life in a mixed reality short produced in collaboration with both Walt Disney Animation Studios and art director and photographer Julian Klincewicz. This all-new short will feature global talent Madelaine Petsch, Amber Liu and Alton Mason enjoying an adventure alongside the Lucky Rabbit. The journey will begin at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, and move through Shanghai, New York, Tokyo and Paris, where Oswald will end his trip at the House of Givenchy.Story continuesEssential pieces for women include a blue varsity jacket with white sleeves with Givenchy and Paris lettering that accentuate placements showing Oswald the Lucky Rabbit offering a flower to his sweetheart, Ortensia. On a bright red oversized shirt and sporty short ensemble, Oswald appears jauntily astride a horse, singing all the way, in white framed by bandana-style prints. On must-have denims, the two characters return, this time in graffiti-style treatments, as multi-colored motifs on a jean jacket with Givenchy lettering and an emblematic 4G logo, and on jeans also decorated with musical quarter and eighth notes. T-shirts in pink, white, black, or red and black tie-dye convey messages of love and the magic of visiting Paris, while hoodies, tanks and track pants incorporate the 4G emblem stylized into a heart and the Magic Kingdom in dropout white.For men, a red varsity jacket sees Oswald riding a bronco to Los Angeles, while a blue button-down shirt frames the character amid bandana-style motifs. Statement denims show Oswald in his feistiest, scrappiest mode, accentuated by a lucky horseshoe in red. T-shirts with GIVENCHY lettering sport key words and places, like ""Lucky"" — with Oswald tearing along on a motorcycle— and ""New York City."" Sweatshirts and track ensembles, too, show him spoiling for a fight with muscles flexed or paws on hips, when he's not fronting a ""Walt Disney Studios"" (Shanghai) logo ready to take on the world.A wide range of good-humored, collectible accessories ranges from Disney x Givenchy tennis shoes, totes, and small cross-body bags to card carriers, phone cases, earbud cases, and caps.To continue the celebration, fans can join in the fun on Snapchat with the Oswald Sky Painter AR lens, which allows users to paint the sky with paint, stencils and passport stamps highlighting the 5 cities of Oswald’s Givenchy journey, beginning December 15, 2022. The lens will become shoppable and link to the Givenchy site beginning December 30.The Disney x Givenchy capsule collection will be available starting December 16th in China, Singapore and Tokyo Ikebukuro pop-up as well as the Miami Aventura pop-up on December 19th and will be available globally on December 30th in stores and on givenchy.com.Prices range from $255 USD to $5,690 USD.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221215005096/en/ContactsDisney Consumer Products, Games and PublishingSara AlvarezPublic Relations Director, Communications818-544-0125SARA.ALVAREZ@DISNEY.COM]"

But among streamers, who will come out on top? Our next guest has an answer for us. Let's bring in Laura Martin, Needham senior media and internet analyst. Laura, nice to see you. Who is winning at this point? And where are we in the game? Are we in the third inning? Are we in the seventh inning?LAURA MARTIN: So we're arguing that we're in the seventh inning, that the die is cast, that the winners are the Disney bundle, which is Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus, as well as Amazon's bundle with Prime shipping on the subscriber side, and then YouTube on the, let's call it, advertising video on-demand free side. And that losers include Netflix, Peacock, Paramount Plus, which also has Showtime, and Discovery with HBO Max. We're saying all of them lose.We're also-- we came out with a piece today saying that the winners can't be displaced, that the three winners will not be able to be unseated. And that 70% to 80% of the total economics will end up in those three companies, which is what we've seen in digital markets, this notion that digital markets are winner-take-all markets for economics. We're arguing that's going to happen here in streaming. And so those three companies are going to get like 70% of the total revenue.SEANA SMITH: So Laura, when it comes to Netflix, specifically, because I think a lot of people, when they think about streaming, one of the first companies they think about is Netflix, what exactly are they doing that has them, I guess, as one of your ""losers,"" quote, unquote, to put it, going forward in this space? And then what happens to the company down the road? Do you still think a possible takeover is in the cards?Story continuesLAURA MARTIN: Right. So what has to happen in 2023? So churn is going up, right? We've created this consumer behavior, where people churn out two to three times out of the typical streaming service, usually around content, like, for example, Netflix hit all-time high churn right after Stranger Things ended in July. So we're creating this consumer behavior where people are churning in and out of streaming services.So churn is job one for 2023. You have to get your churn down because the customer acquisition costs means you have to have a subscriber for like nine months before you get a payback just on your customer acquisition cost. So churn has to go down. Well, Netflix starts with the lowest churn, so that's really hard for them to get their churn to go lower.And then secondly, the other growth driver for revenue is rolling out into new countries. No one else is fully penetrated, so they're all going to report faster revenue growth, because they're going to roll out Saudi Arabia, or they're going to roll out Costa Rica, or they're going to roll out, Portugal. Guess what? Netflix is already in those countries. So it can't like, grow there. It's like a same store comp for them, which means they're going to lose subscribers, we think, to these other guys that are going to be more competitive with bundling, with their bundles with their theme parks, or with their bundles with their Prime shipping, or Apple with their devices. All those bundles are going to take share from Netflix, which can't bundle because it doesn't own anything else. And if you're rolling out new countries, that helps your revenue growth a lot.DAVE BRIGGS: And in your note, you say Netflix has a competitive disadvantage. Is that why? And could they find a dance partner?LAURA MARTIN: They could if they got bought, like, for example, I think it's widely-- it's a confusion why they picked Microsoft, which actually doesn't have very good ad tech for what they need it for. And there's plenty of established players that would have been a better choice. I think assuming that the Netflix guys really are thinking strategically rather than tactically, it maybe they just want to sell to Microsoft. So that would make sense to me. Then they would have a bundle, because now they have something bigger to offer with Microsoft.But standalone? No, I don't think they can create a bundle-- too late. I mean, these other companies are competing with, whether it's Comcast or Paramount. They have parks. They have films. They have other streaming services that they-- all those are bundle opportunities for sort of everybody else other than them.SEANA SMITH: Laura, one company we haven't mentioned yet that's in the streaming space is Apple. Where do they land in your thesis just in terms of the winners and losers? And what we can expect from the company going forward?LAURA MARTIN: So Apple is the sleeping giant here. I would say they've done a bad job to date of actually the streaming content business. They're spending round numbers $2 billion a year. This is a game where you have to spend 15, or you're not serious. So the only thing I'd say is they make $90 billion a year of free cash flow, and they have a billion unique users.So if they ever got serious, they would be a juggernaut. They could unseat everybody that I've said can't be unseated, because they have $90 billion cash flow and a billion unique users globally, like, on day one. So they're like the dark horse I think it is possible they never decide they need to be in the content business. I think near-term, they're going to be focusing on advertising revenue. And content is messy, and it's hard to manage the people, as we've seen from the Walt Disney company's CEO trader trading off. It's hard to manage creative people. So maybe Apple just stays away from content and just keeps doing $1 or $2 billion a year, exclusive to its platform, not really a major streaming player.DAVE BRIGGS: Interesting contract with Major League Soccer, but other than Ted Lasso, not a lot of major buzz around their content. If we're in the seventh inning, that means it's almost game over for somebody. Will we see someone not survive this game? Who is it? And before you go, you got to tell me what you're watching right now, Laura. What are you streaming?LAURA MARTIN: OK. ""Wednesday"" on Netflix. ""Wednesday,"" I think, is a really interesting sort of pro-feminist point of view and very dark, you know? So I think very interesting on Netflix. And then gave me-- yeah, so I think, so loser-- losing can be winning here. So like, Curious-- the investable companies, Curiosity Stream, Chicken Soup for the Soul, WWE, all get bought, because they have IP. They own library. They own their own content. So that gets bought by a bigger player-- Comcast, or Paramount, or-- gets bought, right? Because they're too small to compete standalone. So I think all those get bought.Paramount, I think, is interesting. If Shari Redstone, who is the controlling shareholder wants to sell, I think Paramount's a winner. I think somebody would pay a lot of money for those libraries. But if she doesn't sell and she overstays her welcome, it's way too small to compete. It's $12 billion market cap. And you're competing against Amazon and the Walt Disney Company, like, or Comcast. You know, what I'm saying, Comcast loses and Discovery, Warner Brothers loses. Like, Paramount can't compete with those companies.So they have to sell. And if they sell, they'll get a nice big premium. And they'll be a winner in this world.DAVE BRIGGS: Nice to hear you mentioned to WWE. That stock up 47% this year. It's been a remarkable performer and really an outlier. Highly recommend the ""White Lotus."" If you're not streaming it, Laura, please do. It's terrific. Season two just wrapped. Great to have you. Laura Martin, always a pleasure. Thanks so much.]"

Building on this bullish narrative, firms like Helmerich &amp; Payne, Patterson-UTI Energy and Precision Drilling have room for upside and are likely to see impressive revenue and cash flow growth. With strict cost control and by optimizing operational leverage in a growth environment, these stocks are good investment opportunities.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry consists of companies that provide rigs (or specialized vehicles) on a contractual basis to explore and develop oil and gas. These operators offer drilling rigs (both land-based/onshore and offshore), equipment, services and manpower to exploration and production companies worldwide.Drilling for hydrocarbons is quite costly and technically difficult, the future of which primarily depends on contracting activity and the total number of available rigs at a given point of time, rather than the price of oil or gas. Within the industry, it's interesting to note that the volatility associated with offshore drilling companies is much higher than their onshore counterparts and their share prices are more correlated to the price of oil. Overall, the drilling stocks are among the most volatile in the entire equity market.3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Drilling Industry's FutureHigher Number of Rigs: Oil and natural gas prices have rebounded sharply, revisiting their multi-year highs earlier this year due to rising demand and geopolitical tensions surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Consequently, drilling activity has been picking up in North America, a region on which most drillers are highly dependent. As a matter of fact, the rig count in early December was 982 compared with 753 a year ago, in sync with the strength in commodity prices. The number of active units in the international market has gained sharply too. The steady growth in rig count is an encouraging indicator of drilling activity.Story continuesLow Replenishment of Reserves Point to Drilling Requirement: One of the key positive arguments for drillers is the focus on the reserve replacement rate. Over the past few years, the supermajors have struggled to replace all of the oil and gas they churn out, raising concerns about future production. In this context, Chevron’s 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% indicates the inability to add proved reserves to the amount of oil and gas produced. This clearly calls for a calibrated approach in meeting reserve shortfalls in the long run. Consequently, a gradual improvement in drilling activity looks likely.Dwindling Pool of Legacy, High-Margin Contracts: For most operators, order levels have remained depressed, and day rates are trending just above cash costs despite the strong rebound in commodity prices. This has put increasing pressure on their revenue-generating capacity. Further, as the companies’ legacy, high-margin contracts wind down slowly, the drillers are faced with the prospect of a drop in backlog (and consequently, revenues), which is likely to accelerate over the next few quarters. This also leaves the drillers vulnerable to addressing their massive debt maturities and investment in newbuilds.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Positive OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry is an 8-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #19, which places it in the top 8% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates upbeat near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a conducive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. While the industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 have improved 53.8% in the past year, the same for 2023 have risen 322.4% over the same timeframe.Considering the encouraging dynamics of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil - Energy Sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has surged 56.2% over this period compared with the broader sector’s increase of 28.4%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 16.2%.Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas drilling companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of non-cash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 13.52X, higher than the S&amp;P 500’s 12.08X. It is also well above the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.21X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 24.76X, as low as 7.28X, with a median of 12.03X.3 Oil and Gas - Drilling Stocks to Buy NowHelmerich &amp; Payne: Helmerich &amp; Payne is engaged in the contract drilling of oil and gas wells in the United States &amp; internationally.

Powered by technology acquired with Threat Stack, AIP is the newest addition to the F5 Distributed Cloud Services portfolio of cloud-native SaaS-based application security and delivery services.Organizations of all sizes across industries are in the midst of efforts aimed at simplifying, securing, and innovating application-driven digital experiences. However, many face the challenge of managing distributed and hybrid application infrastructures composed of workloads across on-premises, public cloud, and edge locations. This creates tremendous complexity and increases the security threat surface, and as a result customers are forced to deploy inconsistent security controls and lack necessary visibility, particularly for cloud-native deployments.Attacks such as those exploiting Log4j and Spring4Shell can evade signature-based detection defense mechanisms and target vulnerabilities and misconfigurations within application infrastructure. Distributed Cloud AIP brings deep telemetry collection and high-efficacy intrusion detection for cloud-native workloads and—when combined with the in-line application and API security from F5 Distributed Cloud WAAP—delivers a defense-in-depth approach to security threats that span across applications, APIs, and the cloud-native infrastructures where they run.""Organizations are managing a dauntingly complex mix of hybrid and multi-cloud application architectures that can slow the pace of digital innovation and create subsequent security risks,"" said Kara Sprague, Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer, F5. ""The addition of AIP fills a critical need for customers as they look for ways to extend robust security controls to multiple cloud infrastructures where they run their modern applications.""Story continuesA large majority of organizations are now deploying microservices-based applications on cloud-native infrastructure and connecting them through APIs. This approach to application development can radically increase the pace of innovation while lowering total cost of ownership. However, vulnerabilities and misconfigurations at the infrastructure level leave these applications open to attack from both internal and external bad actors. These intruders leverage vulnerabilities in cloud services or stolen keys to get access to cloud-native resources, where they can move freely throughout the infrastructure, inject malware, run cryptominers, or access sensitive data.F5 Distributed Cloud App Infrastructure Protection addresses these challenges through:A combination of rules and machine learning to detect threats in real time across the entire infrastructure stack: cloud provider APIs, virtual machine instances, containers, and Kubernetes. With behavioral-based detection, AIP can identify insider threats, external threats, and data loss risk for modern applications.Detection and alert of anomalous behavior impacting workloads to inform operations teams of potentially malicious activity that may require further action to block or remediate.Complementing existing signature- and behavioral-based threat detection capabilities with actionable insights from advanced telemetry and detection of post-exploit activity at the app and cloud infrastructure level.F5 Distributed Cloud AIP Managed Security Services, an ""always-on"" Security Operations Center team that detects, triages, and investigates threats and provides remediation recommendations on behalf of customers.F5 Distributed Cloud AIP Insights, providing custom platform analytics and ongoing coaching from F5’s cloud security experts to help customers build a stronger cloud SecOps strategy and better achieve their goals.More information can be found on the product page of f5.com.Additional ResourcesA Conversation with Kara Sprague, EVP and Chief Product Officer – F5 Q&amp;AEnhancing Modern App Security: Introducing F5 Distributed Cloud AIP – F5 Blog PostF5 Appoints Kara Sprague as Chief Product Officer – F5 Press ReleaseAbout F5F5 is a multi-cloud application services and security company committed to bringing a better digital world to life.​​​​​​​ F5 partners with the world’s largest, most advanced organizations to secure and optimize every app and API anywhere—on premises, in the cloud, or at the edge.

The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $4 billion.Third Point mentioned Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its recently-published Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)8.

Strength in the second quarter was driven by better-than-expected sales of consumable items. Guidance for the remainder of the year was increased.

(NYSE:PM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:Coho is not immune to the earnings pressure exerted by a strong USD, although the portfolio on the whole has modestly less foreign revenue exposure relative to the S&amp;P 500 Index. The two most impacted Coho stocks includes Philip Morris International, which essentially derives all of its revenues outside the U.S. Harkening back to Table 1, the decline in Philip Morris earnings for 2022 versus the reported earnings in 2021 is entirely related to the strengthening dollar.

Shares have added about 1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Dentsply due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.DENTSPLY SIRONA Q3 Earnings &amp; Revenues Miss EstimatesDENTSPLY SIRONA reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 41 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents by 30.5%. The bottom line declined 31.5% on a year-over-year basis.On a GAAP basis, the company incurred a loss of $5.01, reflecting an improvement of 4.4% from the year-ago quarter. The company recorded a non-cash charge for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $1.1 billion net of tax. The charge reflected the impact of macroeconomic factors as a result of weakened global demand, higher cost of capital, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, and increased raw material, supply chain and service costs.RevenuesRevenues in the quarter under review amounted to $947 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.1%. The top line decreased 8.9% year over year. Sales were down 0.7% on an organic basis.Management stated that it is encouraged by the double-digit growth in clear aligners, solid performance in Europe, and continued strong demand for Imaging equipment amid continued macroeconomic headwinds, including foreign currency impacts, global supply chain challenges, and regional softness in the United States and China. However, management was not satisfied with the results and stated that it has initiated a comprehensive review of the entire business to improve execution, build a winning portfolio and return to growth.Business DetailsConsumablesRevenues of the Consumables segment fell 8.7% year over year and 2.5% on an organic basis in the third quarter to $391 million. Per management, the decline was led by softening demand in the United States and China, partially offset by the demand for preventive consumables.Story continuesTechnologies &amp; EquipmentTechnologies &amp; Equipment’s revenues were down 9% year over year to $556 million in the reported quarter. On an organic basis, net sales rose 0.6%. Higher demand for clear aligners and imaging equipment drove organic revenues, partially offset by lower CAD/CAM volumes.Revenues by GeographyIn the United States, revenues decreased 7.2% year over year to $357 million. Rest of World revenues fell 11.6% year over year to $232 million. European revenues declined 8.8% year over year to $358 million. However, sales were up 3% and 0.1% organically in the European and Rest of the World markets, respectively. Organic sales declined 5.2% in the U.S. market.Margin AnalysisGross profit in the reported quarter amounted to $508 million, down 10.7% on a year-over-year basis. The gross margin was 53.6%, contracting 110 basis points.Selling, general and administrative expenses were $401 million, up 1.5% from the year-ago quarter. Research and development expenses amounted to $41 million, up 5.1% from the prior-year quarter.Operating loss was $1.22 billion against an operating income of $132 million in the year-ago quarter.Financial ConditionDENTSPLY SIRONA exited the third quarter of 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $418 million, up from $339 million at the end of December 2021.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of the third quarter was $375 million compared with $435 million in the year-ago period.2022 GuidanceDENTSPLY SIRONA lowered its guidance for revenues and EPS in 2022 to reflect the adverse impact of macroeconomic headwinds. The company now projects 2022 revenues within $3.85-$3.88 billion, down from $4.1-$4.2 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $4.05 billion. The outlook includes an organic sales decline of approximately 2%.The company expects an adjusted EPS of $1.90-$2.00, down from the previous guidance of $2.35-$2.55. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $2.35.Our TakeDENTSPLY SIRONA ended the third quarter on a weak note, wherein both earnings and revenues missed the consensus mark. The company saw continued strong demand for Imaging equipment during the quarter as well as in European businesses. However, the ongoing macro headwinds impacted third-quarter results adversely, which is likely to continue for the rest of 2022. Weakness in the U.S. markets is also discouraging.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -47.83% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Dentsply has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Dentsply has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerDentsply belongs to the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry. Another stock from the same industry, Cardinal Health (CAH), has gained 5.3% over the past month.

In August, spending on dental services was estimated to stand at $113.4 billion, representing a 6.4% increase from 12 months prior. With spending on dental care rising and recovering, dentists today are more confident in a full-fledged recovery in the dental sector since its previous lows.While more renowned companies like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) have been playing a role in the dental care sector with their provision of oral care products such as toothpaste, toothbrushes, and more, other companies offering dental implants and clear aligners have been in the spotlight just as much. The main players in the dental products and implants sector today include names like Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSIC), Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN), and Straumann (SWX:STMN). Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSIC) accounts for about 28.6% of the market share in the dental equipment industry, while Align Technology, Inc.

Straumann (SWX:STMN) also constitutes about 24% of the global dentistry market share.One new and profitable segment within the broader dental care industry is that of dental implants. According to a report by Grand View Research, the dental implant market size is expected to reach $9.62 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of 9.8%. Clear aligners have also become more popular and have seen growing demand in global markets, with growing aesthetic awareness.

The report combines data from a new consumer survey with national threat data collected by Xfinity’s xFi Advanced Security platform.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221214005221/en/Comcast has Protected Customers from Nearly 10 Billion Cybersecurity Threats Using xFi Advanced Security (Photo: Business Wire)The Xfinity Cyber Report also reveals that xFi Advanced Security, which is free for Xfinity customers who lease a capable Xfinity gateway, has blocked nearly 10 billion cybersecurity threats since it launched less than five years ago.""This holiday season consumers are purchasing and connecting more devices to their home networks than ever before,"" said Noopur Davis, EVP, Chief Information Security Officer and Product Privacy Officer, Comcast. ""With this influx of devices comes an influx of cybersecurity risk. Now more than ever, consumers need to prioritize keeping their connected devices, and the people who use them, safe from cyber threats.""The Xfinity Cyber Health Report analyzes cyber threat trends, the growing list of devices in connected homes, and a view into consumers’ attitudes and behaviors around cyber protection. Key findings include:Connected Homes Are Expanding. So is Attack Volume: Xfinity xFi homes average 15 connected devices, up 25 percent from 2020. Power users average 34 devices. And, 58 percent of consumers plan to buy at least one connected device this holiday season. xFi Advanced Security blocks an average of 23 unique threats per home each month – with the total number of attacks at least three-to-four times that number, since many attacks are repeated.Story continuesConsumers Still Underestimate Threats: Nearly three fourths (74 percent) of Americans believe less than 10 attacks hit their home network every month. 61 percent believe devices are protected from threats right out-of-the-box at purchase. This leaves many new devices open to potential threats without protection.Consumers Unsure They’d Know They’ve Been Hacked: When asked how soon they would know whether they were a victim of a cyberattack, only 20 percent said immediately. Another 32 percent said they aren’t sure they’d ever know if they were a victim of a cyberattack. And, 51 percent of respondents noted they are not confident that they would know if a non-screen device was hacked, such as a robot vacuum or a smart plug.Emerging Device Vulnerabilities Misunderstood: Computers and smartphones remain the top two targeted devices consistent with findings in 2020. While consumers recognize the risks associated with these two device types, they underestimate the risk with emerging devices in their homes. In fact, xFi Advanced Security blocked threats to smart watches, lighting, thermostats, doorbells, garage openers, sports and fitness equipment, sprinkler systems and even cars, drones and pet accessories.Generational Cyber Divide: 70 percent of Boomers admit to unsafe behaviors compared with Gen X (80 percent), Millennials (82 percent) and Gen Z (87 percent). Gen Z had the lowest awareness of common threats like phishing and malware. 77 percent of Millennials are likely to buy a connected device this holiday season, the most for any segment surveyed.The 2022 Xfinity Cyber Health Report also includes insights from Asad Haque, Comcast’s Executive Director of Security Architecture, regarding connected home security with Matter and xPKI; a primer on Comcast’s threat analytics platform from David White, Vice President, Security Engineering at Comcast; the role of Comcast’s xGitGuardTM software in data privacy from Bahman Rashidi, Ph.D., Director, Cybersecurity &amp; Privacy Engineering Research; and actionable tips for consumers on securing their connected home.As the largest broadband provider in the U.S. serving more than 32 million internet customer households, Comcast’s xFi Advanced Security service protects home networks from cyber threats and is free to all internet customers with the xFi Gateway who sign in through the Xfinity app. It uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to monitor, analyze and block suspicious activity in real-time. To date, xFi Advanced Security has blocked nearly 10 billion cybersecurity threats. To activate this service, Xfinity xFi customers can log onto the Xfinity app and enable xFi Advanced Security.About the SurveyThe survey, conducted by Wakefield Research, polled 1,000 nationally representative U.S. adults ages 18 and older in November 2022, using an email invitation and an online survey. Results of any sample are subject to sampling variation. The magnitude of the variation is measurable and is affected by the number of interviews and the level of the percentages expressing the results. For the interviews conducted in this particular study, the chances are 95 in 100 that a survey result does not vary, plus or minus, by more than 3.1 percentage points from the result that would be obtained if interviews had been conducted with all persons in the universe represented by the sample.To download the 2022 Xfinity Cyber health Report, go to https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/cyber-health-report-2022.About Comcast CorporationComcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA) is a global media and technology company that connects people to moments that matter.

Citing the need to defend democracy, the firms said they would suspend campaign donations to the 147 Republicans who voted against certifying the presidential election results that day.In some cases those suspensions only lasted a few months, according to the Bloomberg News review of hundreds of campaign finance disclosures covering the period from March 2021 to last month. Major companies including AT&amp;T Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Intel Corp. quietly reopened the taps in time to help the GOP win control of the House of Representatives.Other industries also resumed giving when it became clear Republicans were poised to retake the House — a tacit acknowledgment that election denial is still a powerful force in the party. But the Bloomberg News review revealed that the technology and telecom sectors were especially generous, contributing $1.3 million in total. And they targeted lawmakers overseeing a potentially hostile congressional agenda likely to include hearings on the treatment of conservative viewpoints on social media, among other topics.The biggest giver in the tech and telecom sectors was AT&amp;T. The No. 3 wireless carrier vowed on Jan. 11, 2021, to “suspend contributions to members of Congress who voted to object to the certification of electoral college votes.”Story continuesIn the months leading up to last month’s midterm elections, the company gave more than $608,900 to dozens of the objectors, documents show. That includes Representatives Burgess Owens of Utah, who said he has “no doubt” that Trump won; New York’s Nicole Malliotakis, who claimed the election was rife with “irregularities and alleged fraud”; and Florida’s Greg Steube, who called the election results “sketchy.”AT&amp;T declined to comment on its giving.Jeremy Funk, spokesman for government watchdog group Accountable.US, said the companies are “choosing to chase after influence, even though a number of them have made bold declarations to their customer base and their shareholders and their own employees about how much they support democracy.”Comcast Corp. said in a statement in January of last year that “the peaceful transition of power is a foundation of America’s democracy.” It vowed to “suspend all of our political contributions to those elected officials who voted against certification of the electoral college votes.”By the end of the 2021, the Philadelphia-based cable giant had not only resumed giving to those candidates, but increased its contributions throughout 2022 to $365,500, becoming the second-biggest donor to election deniers among the tech and telecom firms.Comcast didn’t respond to a request for comment.Industries Facing Congressional ScrutinyOne reason for the reversals is the companies have a lot to gain or lose in a GOP-led House.Republicans have already signaled they intend to target social media companies and their treatment of conservative viewpoints in the first 100 days of taking the majority next month. Other blockbuster issues the companies are nervously watching include net neutrality, antitrust and online privacy.Conversely, telecom companies and semiconductor makers want more government aid for programs to boost broadband rollout and domestic manufacturing. That requires developing relationships with newly empowered Republicans.Intel donated to 29 members who voted against Biden’s certification. The contributions came even as Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger made appearances with Biden at the White House and was a guest at his State of the Union address.Intel is set to receive a windfall of cash from the government after Biden signed legislation granting $53 billion to boost domestic semiconductor research and development.Intel, in a statement, said it strives for a balance between donations to Democrats and Republicans “to build a bipartisan coalition of members of Congress who share our vision for strengthening America’s semiconductor industry, innovation capabilities and technological leadership.”“Intel’s Political Action Committee continuously evaluates its contributions to ensure that they align with our values, policies and priorities. Over the past year, we have implemented additional due diligence processes as Intel resumed contributions that were previously halted,” the company said.Key Lawmakers in Leadership TargetedThe companies aimed their donations strategically.Among the big recipients: Kevin McCarthy of California, who is running to be speaker in January, and Louisiana Representative Steve Scalise, who will serve as House majority leader and sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Both men voted against certifying Biden’s victory.McCarthy collected thousands of dollars from companies including Verizon Communications Inc., Dish Network Corp., Intel and Comcast.Ohio Republican Representative Jim Jordan is expected to take the top spot on the House Judiciary Committee, which oversees tech issues including antitrust and patent reform. He voted against Biden’s certification but got money from Verizon and Oracle Corp., both of which had pledged to suspend those gifts and declined to comment on the reversals.Comcast gave to several lawmakers who serve on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees telecom issues and will likely pursue a deregulatory agenda under GOP leadership. Among them: Indiana Representative Greg Pence and Pennsylvania Representative Mike Kelly, both of whom voted against certification of Biden’s win. Kelly filed lawsuits seeking to throw out all of Pennsylvania’s mail-in ballots.Some Companies Gave Even While Sticking to PledgeOther companies, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp., stuck to pledges not to contribute to the 147, but backed other candidates who cast doubt on the election in court filings, debates, campaign rallies and interviews.Google, Dell Technologies Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Microsoft and other tech companies showered $90,000 on Washington’s Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who is set to become the chair of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, where she will help lead the GOP’s tech and telecom agenda. McMorris Rodgers didn’t vote against certifying Biden’s win, but she supported the Texas lawsuit asking the Supreme Court to intervene in the election.Amazon contributed $135,500 to election deniers, including $17,500 to lawmakers who voted against certification.Amazon said its pause lasted long enough. “When we announced shortly after the attack on the Capitol in January 2021 that we would suspend donations to members of Congress who voted against certifying the results of the 2020 US presidential election, it was not intended to be permanent,” a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “It’s been more than 21 months since that suspension and, like a number of companies, we’ve resumed giving to some members.”Microsoft gave roughly $95,000 to lawmakers who expressed doubt about the 2020 election results, but didn’t vote against certification in accordance with its pledge. The company said it hasn’t decided how much longer to keep that ban in place.“It’s a really good question — we’ll have to sit down and decide as we get to January,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said in an interview. “I hope that we’ll see politicians as they look to the future and future elections sign up for the proposition that if they come up short in the votes, they will concede in the election.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple Investors’ Loyalty Is Rewarded With a $454 Billion GiftChina’s Hasty Reopening Is a Risky Bet That Beijing Can Control the NarrativeChild Care Faces $24 Billion Fiscal Cliff as Pandemic Aid EndsHow a Cocaine-Smuggling Cartel Infiltrated the World’s Biggest Shipping CompanyHow to Make Cars Safer for Women?

We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest Dividend Cuts and Suspensions of 2022.  Suggested articles:10 Best Medical Stocks Under $2015 Countries That Produce the Most Solar Energy11 Undervalued Canadian Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

(URI) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-rentals-inc-uri-soars-141502032.html,1671027302,STORY,['URI'],"[Have you been paying attention to shares of United Rentals (URI)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 3.4% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $372 in the previous session. United Rentals has gained 10.5% since the start of the year compared to the -18.1% move for the Zacks Construction sector and the -20.2% return for the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 26, 2022, United Rentals reported EPS of $9.27 versus consensus estimate of $9.For the current fiscal year, United Rentals is expected to post earnings of $32.39 per share on $11.63 billion in revenues. This represents a 46.83% change in EPS on a 19.72% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $36.43 per share on $12.78 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 12.45% and 9.85%, respectively.Valuation MetricsUnited Rentals may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.United Rentals has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and F, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 11.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 13X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 7.4X versus its peer group's average of 9.9X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.62. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, United Rentals currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if United Rentals fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though United Rentals shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 43% to be precise, is individual insiders. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).With such a notable stake in the company, insiders would be highly incentivised to make value accretive decisions.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Oracle. See our latest analysis for Oracle ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Oracle?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Oracle does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Oracle, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthHedge funds don't have many shares in Oracle. Our data suggests that Lawrence Ellison, who is also the company's Top Key Executive, holds the most number of shares at 42%. When an insider holds a sizeable amount of a company's stock, investors consider it as a positive sign because it suggests that insiders are willing to have their wealth tied up in the future of the company. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 5.0% and 4.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.A more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 3 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 52% stake.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of OracleThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Oracle Corporation. Insiders own US$94b worth of shares in the US$221b company. That's quite meaningful. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Oracle better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Oracle that you should be aware of before investing here.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Continuing one of the fastest expansions of any major cloud provider, Oracle's 41st global region and fourth in the U.S. offers customers and partners a new option to locate their infrastructure, applications, and data for optimal performance and latency. The Oracle Cloud Chicago Region gives public and private sector customers and partners based in the U.S. Midwest access to a wide range of cloud services to modernize their applications, innovate with data and analytics, and migrate mission-critical workloads from their data centers to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).Oracle Logo (PRNewsfoto/Oracle)""As the home to more than 20 percent of the Fortune 500, 60 percent of all U.S. manufacturing, and the world's largest financial derivatives exchange, the U.S. Midwest is a global innovation hub across key industries,"" said Clay Magouyrk, Executive Vice President, OCI. ""These industries are increasingly seeking secure cloud services to support their need for high-speed data transfer at ultra-low latency. We are excited to open the new Chicago region to help our Midwest customers and partners easily and securely move their mission-critical workloads to the cloud.""The new Chicago region will offer over 100 OCI services and applications, including Oracle Autonomous Database, MySQL Heatwave, OCI Data Science, Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes, and Oracle Analytics. These applications and services will help startups, mid-size, and enterprise teams harness data to uncover new business value and optimize applications without requiring costly re-architecture.Story continuesSecurity to Meet Customers' Compliance Requirements The Oracle Cloud Chicago Region has been designed to enable high availability, data residency, and disaster protection. OCI offers layers of security to help ensure resources are provisioned securely for every customer, a zero trust architecture for maximum isolation of customer tenancies, and many integrated customer security services that are offered at no extra charge.In addition, the Oracle Cloud Chicago Region is designed to help meet the security and compliance needs of customers in both the commercial and public sectors. OCI's architecture is designed to allow cloud regions to be deployed within separate secure and isolated realms for different uses. The Chicago area is the location of an existing Oracle Cloud Region with DISA Impact Level 5 authorization for use by U.S. government organizations to store and process Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and National Security Systems (NSS) information. Oracle currently operates several independent realms serving the U.S. and U.K. governments, and Oracle has announced that it plans to offer a sovereign cloud realm for the European Union in 2023.High Availability and Low Latency Provides Customers with a Resilient Cloud FoundationOCI's next-generation architecture provides a higher performing, resilient foundation for cloud services, while its physical and virtual network design helps maximize performance and security. For example, each Oracle Cloud Region contains at least three fault domains, which are groupings of hardware that form logical data centers for high availability and resilience to hardware and network failures. In addition, the Oracle Cloud Chicago Region offers three availability domains connected with a high-performance network, helping to enable customers to create highly resilient distributed application architectures.The new Oracle Cloud Chicago Region provides low-latency networking and high-speed data transfer to allow customers and partners to derive better value from their data. The new region also helps ensure business continuity by creating disaster recovery capabilities using Oracle's existing U.S. cloud regions in Ashburn, Phoenix, and San Jose. In addition, OCI's distributed cloud solutions, including Dedicated Region and Exadata Cloud@Customer, can assist with applications where data proximity and low latency in specific locations are of critical importance.A Focus on Driving Sustainable Operations Across the GlobeUnderscoring its ongoing focus on sustainability, Oracle has committed to powering all worldwide Oracle Cloud Regions with 100 percent renewable energy by 2025, including the new Oracle Cloud Chicago Region. Several Oracle Cloud regions, including regions in North America, South America, and all 10 regions in Europe, are already powered by 100 percent renewable energy, which enables customers to run their computing services more sustainably and with a lower carbon footprint. To further advance its commitment to sustainable operations, Oracle recycled 99.9 percent of its retired hardware in FY'22.OCI's Extensive Global Ecosystem Helps Ease and Accelerate Cloud Adoption OCI's extensive network of more than 75 global and regional OCI FastConnect partners offers organizations dedicated connectivity to Oracle Cloud Regions and OCI services. FastConnect provides an easy, flexible, and cost-effective way to create a dedicated, private network connection with higher bandwidth, lower latency, and more consistent performance versus public, Internet-based connections. CoreSite and Digital Realty are the host partners for the new Oracle Cloud Chicago Region's FastConnect locations. Partners available at launch for the Oracle Cloud Chicago Region include Megaport, Equinix, CoreSite, and Digital Realty.Customers, Partners, and Analysts Welcome the New Oracle Cloud Chicago Region ""Zebra Technologies' products, software, services, and solutions help businesses solve complex problems using data and analytics to digitize and automate their workflows on the front line of business. We look forward to the Oracle Cloud Chicago Region giving us the cloud infrastructure we need to drive our business so we can help organizations around the world sense what's happening in their operations, analyze that data to deliver insights, and act on those insights to make smarter decisions in near real time,"" said Matt Ausman, chief information officer, Zebra Technologies.""The days of the cloud being a 'one-size-fits-all' proposition are long gone, and Oracle recognizes that its customers want freedom of choice in their cloud deployments. By continuing to establish cloud regions at a rapid pace in strategic locations such as the U.S. Midwest, Oracle is demonstrating a commitment to giving its customers as many options as possible to leverage the cloud on their terms,"" said  Chris Kanaracus, research director, IDC.""The Chicago metropolitan area is a global hub for key industries such as financial services and manufacturing. The new Oracle Cloud region will provide clients with more choices for their cloud deployments, and we look forward to collaborating with Oracle to help organizations in the Midwest more quickly and easily harness the business-changing benefits of the cloud,"" said Samia Tarraf, Oracle Business Group global lead, Accenture.Oracle Cloud's Rapidly-Growing Global FootprintOracle provides a broad and consistent set of cloud services across 41 commercial and government cloud regions in 22 countries on five continents to serve its growing global customer base.

Through the end of Nov 2022, the 2022 Zacks Top 10 was down 10.6% but that was beating the S&amp;P 500, which had fallen 13.7% during that same time.Some of his bets paid off which helped the portfolio to outperform.What Worked in 20221.       Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle is a large American lithium producer. Lithium is one of the key ingredients in electric vehicle batteries. With General Motors saying they will be selling a million EV cars a year in the United States by 2025, that means that there will be big demand for the batteries, and, for now, also for lithium.Albemarle shares are up 12% year-to-date but the shares remain cheap. Albemarle trades with a forward P/E of 12.3 as earnings are expected to rise 420% this year and another 34% next year.Story continuesWill Albemarle’s rally continue into 2023?2.       Nutrien (NTR)Nutrien is a large Canadian fertilizer manufacturer. Potash prices broke out to new highs this year, boosted by fears of a shortage during the Ukraine War. But potash prices have now fallen, and so have Nutrien’s earnings estimates.After soaring to new multi-year highs in the spring, Nutrien shares have come back down to earth and are now up only 2.5% year-to-date. But they are in the green when a lot of other stocks are not.Nutrien earnings are expected to rise 122% this year, but fall 6% in 2023. Still, Nutrien shares are cheap, with a forward P/E of just 5.6.Nutrien is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Will earnings turn around next year?3.       Oracle (ORCL)Oracle is in the red this year, but it’s off its recent lows. Shares are down just 7.6% year-to-date.Earnings are expected to be up 1.2% in fiscal 2023 and another 11.7% in fiscal 2024. Oracle shares are now cheap, with a forward P/E of just 16.4.Is the worst over for Oracle shares and tech?Energy and the BanksWhat Sheraz did not have in 2022’s top 10 portfolio was an energy stock or a bank. Could he be poised to put one, or both, in 2023’s portfolio?4.       Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD)Sheraz confessed on the podcast that exploration and producer, Pioneer Natural Resources, was on his short list for the 2022 Top 10. But he ultimately didn’t put it in the portfolio.Energy has been the best performing sector in the S&amp;P 500. Pioneer Natural Resources is up 23.6% year-to-date and that doesn’t even include it’s big dividend.Earnings are expected to jump 136% this year but fall 16.7% next year as oil and natural gas prices fall.Pioneer Natural Resources is cheap, with a forward P/E of 7.Should energy be in your portfolio in 2023?5.       Comerica (CMA)Comerica is a large Texas bank, which also has operations in several other states including Michigan. The banks have struggled in 2022 even as the Fed has raised rates.Comerica shares have fallen 23.8% year-to-date and are dirt cheap on a P/E basis, with a forward P/E of 8.0.Earnings are expected to be up just 1.4% in 2022 but analysts are bullish for next year, with earnings growth forecast to be 18.8%.Comerica pays a dividend and it’s now yielding 4%.Will the banks finally have their day in the sun in 2023?What Else Do You Need to Know About Picking Stocks for 2023?Listen to this week’s podcast to find out.[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of NTR and PXD in her personal portfolio.]Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

Well, simply put, we had an outstanding quarter. Total revenue for the quarter was more than $200 million above the high end of our guidance range and grew 25% in constant currency. Even excluding Cerner, total revenue grew 9% in constant currency that's higher than Q1 and on top of a revenue beat this time last year. The strength of the quarter is even more amazing, given that the currency headwind was higher than what it was when I gave guidance with 6% for revenue and a $0.095 headwind for earnings per share. And yet, we still exceeded the high end of my USD guidance for both, total revenue and earnings per share. And as you can see from the numbers, we continue to experience clear company-specific and product-specific momentum.The reasons are many, but it boils down to a few key points of differentiation. First, more and more customers are recognizing our second-generation infrastructure cloud as being fundamentally better architected for higher performance, better security and unmatched reliability versus the older first-generation hyperscale cloud providers. Second, customers appreciate the flexibility of our service and business model that enables them to deploy our technologies where it serves them best, whether that be in the public cloud, in dedicated regions around the world or in a true clouded customer implementation. And third, customers recognize the value of an end-to-end integrated stack of applications, both horizontal, like ERP and HCM and supply chain, and industry-specific applications that focus on their industries.And all of it is on our Gen 2 infrastructure, which is designed perfectly for them as they move through. As customers increasingly look to better value out of their technology investments, many discover that Oracle is much better compared to other alternatives. Gartner formerly recognized OCI by moving us to Visionary status in its cloud infrastructure and platform services report for the first time. In addition, last week, we were awarded a JWCC award at the U.S. Department of Defense as they also recognized our capabilities. As all of these differentiators come together and our business continues to accelerate, we expect organic growth for our fiscal year 2023 cloud revenues will be over 30% in constant currency. Now to the numbers. As always, I'll discuss our results using constant currency growth rate.To provide a full picture, both organically and otherwise, I'm going to go over the revenue results, including Cerner, and then some of the revenue results excluding Cerner, so you can see what's going on. Total cloud revenue, now that's SaaS and IaaS, including Cerner, was $3.8 billion, up 48% in constant currency with IaaS revenue, $1.1 billion, up 59% and SaaS revenue of $2.8 billion, up 45%. Now, excluding Cerner, total cloud revenue, SaaS plus IaaS was up 27% in constant currency at $3.3 billion. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter, including Cerner, was $8.6 billion, up 20% in constant currency, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database and, of course, our Generation 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which include support, were $4.1 billion, up 35% in constant currency.Infrastructure subscription revenues, which also include support, were $4.5 billion, up 9% in constant currency. Application subscription revenues, including support but excluding Cerner, were $3.3 billion, up 9% in constant currency. SaaS cloud revenue, again, excluding Cerner, was $2.2 billion and was up 16%. Now, our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $5.9 billion and grew 26% in constant currency, including Fusion ERP, up 28% and NetSuite ERP, up 29%. As mentioned already, infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 59% in constant currency. Now excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 69% with an annualized revenue of $3.8 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 88% and cloud and customer consumption revenue, up 83% and autonomous database up 50%.Software license revenues, including Cerner, were $1.4 billion, up 23% in constant currency and up 9% without Cerner. What is increasingly resonating with customers is that in an environment where IT investments need to have a fast and tangible return on investment, only Oracle offers customers the flexibility to manage their technology estate, so they can deploy incremental investments where it brings them the most immediate value. It also helps that the purchase of technology licenses from Oracle enables them to move to the cloud as they are ready, effectively providing an on-ramp to Oracle Cloud services. So, all in, total revenues for the quarter were $12.3 billion, up 25% in constant currency. Excluding Cerner's revenue contribution of $1.5 billion, organic revenue was up over 9% in constant currency.As a reminder, we no longer operate in Russia, causing total revenue growth to be negatively affected by over 1% of growth over last year. Shifting to margins. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 79% as a result of the mix between support and cloud. Last year, Oracle license support revenue with its mid-90s gross margins represented about 65% of the total number of cloud services and license support revenue. Now, it's down to 53%, and this is happening because our cloud services are growing much, much faster than license support. By the way, license support grew 4% this year. Additionally, I would note that IaaS gross margins improved again this quarter, and I expect IaaS gross margins will continue to improve in response to accelerating demand we have continued to build data center capacity.We have seen that as those centers fill up, margins go up like they did this quarter. Most importantly, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 13% with Cerner and 6%, excluding Cerner in Q2. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, up 12% from last year. Operating margin, including Cerner, was 41% as we continue to integrate Cerner in the quarter. As we drive Cerner profitability to Oracle levels and continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also grow the operating margin percentage. Further, I expect that this year, will be the trough year for operating margin percentages. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20.4. I think I guided to 20.5. So basically, it worked out where we thought.And non-GAAP EPS was $1.21 in U.S. dollars, down 1% in USD, up 7% in constant currency. The GAAP EPS was $0.63. At quarter end, we had nearly $7.4 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.7 billion, up 14% in constant currency. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $15.1 billion and free cash flow was $8.4 billion with capital expenditures of $6.7 billion. In addition, we now have 40 public cloud regions around the world with another 9 being built. In addition, 12 of these public regions interconnect with Azure, giving customers true multi-cloud capabilities. We also have many cloud customer implementations, dedicated regions in another 9 national security regions with increasing demand for more as customers want to have their data protected in their country.We are careful to pace our investments appropriately, but need to continue to build to meet our accelerating demand. CapEx this quarter was $2.4 billion as we continued to invest in our cloud to meet this accelerating demand. With triple-digit IaaS bookings growth the last couple of quarters we now expect to spend about this amount per quarter for the next few quarters as we build capacity for our customers' needs. This level of spend though will not negatively impact our operating margins as we scale. When I talk about accelerating demand, that demand is reflected in the remaining performance obligation or RPO balance, which is now at $61.2 billion, up 68% in constant currency due to strong cloud bookings as well as to Cerner. I will also note that the organic RPO growth rate in constant currency accelerated to 28% in Q2, up from 22% last quarter and approximately 48% of the total RPO is to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.Now, as we've said before, I know you're tired of me saying it, but I will, we are continuing -- we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million shares for a total of $448 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $863 million in the quarter, and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Our fundamental principle is to grow non-GAAP EPS while substantially increasing cloud revenue growth. And given our increasing confidence, we will continue to prudently invest as there is strong demand for our cloud services. So now, let me turn to my guidance for Q3, which I'll provide on a non-GAAP basis.Using currency exchange rates as they are right now, currency should have a 4% negative effect on total revenue and at least a $0.06 negative effect on EPS in Q3. As I say every quarter, the actual currency impact may be different by quarter end, but we've got to use a number, so we're using the number right now. Total revenues for Q3, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 21% to 23% in constant currency and are expected to grow from 17% to 19% in USD. Total cloud growth, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 46% to 50% in constant currency and 43% to 47% in USD. I expect the total cloud growth for the fiscal year, excluding Cerner will be above 30% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 9% and 13% and be between $1.23 and $1.27 in constant currency.Again, due to currency headwinds, non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 4% and 8% and be between $1.17 and $1.21 in USD. And as I've said before, Cerner will be accretive to earnings this year, including in Q3. My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes our base tax rate of 20.5%, which is up from 19% last year. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.Larry Ellison: Thank you, Safra. Okay. I'm going to go over -- primarily, I'm going to go over customers and new wins in infrastructure and then customers and wins and go-lives in applications. But I'm going to start with infrastructure. So, during Q2, we signed multiple customers to contracts exceeding $1 billion, infrastructure contracts exceeding $1 billion. Let me be clear, multiple customers signed contracts for $1 billion worth of infrastructure. So, given -- that's been added to our backlog, we expect our infrastructure business to continue to grow very, very strongly into the future. We now have 22,000 infrastructure customers. We have a total of 55 regions. That's public regions plus national security regions and the other kinds of regions and that's more than AWS or Microsoft or anybody, which may surprise some people.Gartner, as Safra mentioned, moved us into the Visionary Quadrant for the first time. So, let me just start naming specific customers and give you a flavor. I'm going to name large customers, small customers. I'm going to focus a little bit on a bunch of international customers to let you know that our investment in data centers all over the world is really paying off. So, our customers include -- big customers include, FedEx, Deutsche Bank, Tokyo Stock Exchange. Let me take a moment to emphasize Tokyo Stock Exchange. We're the only ones running a major stock exchange. And this is -- Tokyo is not the only one because our cloud is very secure and extremely reliable. It doesn't go down. In fact, my favorite quote from a big phone company in the United States was the difference between Oracle's Cloud and the other clouds are simply that Oracle Cloud doesn't go down.I think that's a very important issue when you have enterprise applications like a stock exchange where you can't ever go down. Fujitsu is another big customer; Vodafone that's phone company has similar problems. If you're a phone company, the phone system can't go down. Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Enbridge; Kaiser, a huge health care company in the -- primarily in the United States. NVIDIA has moved and a bunch of others have moved, lots of AI, artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads to the Oracle Cloud because it turns out we're really good at that. We're better than that than any of the other clouds, which may surprise some people. Schneider Electric, Telecom Italia, Verizon and lots, lots more. I'm not just going to list them all.We publish a big list at oracle.com and every quarter, we add new customers to that. So, in the quarter, we added United Airlines -- database wins in the quarter, United Airlines, migrating all flight operations to the Oracle Exadata cloud. Albertsons, again, moving to the Exadata cloud service database. Mitsui in Japan, again, moving their databases to Oracle. Again, this is the beginning of a very major, very large business for us as our database franchise moves primarily from on-premise into the Oracle Cloud. Persol Career, a big professional services company in Japan, migrating to -- or moving their Oracle databases to the cloud. Unimed, LAD Healthcare, once again moving their databases to the Oracle Cloud. Penske Truck Leasing, doing using -- moving to autonomous database.HomeServe plc in the UK, government agency is moving the autonomous transaction processing system. So, they're not just moving an existing Oracle database to the cloud, they're upgrading from our on-premise Oracle database to our autonomous database, which is only available in the cloud. Iberia Express, a big telco, same thing moving to autonomous data warehouse. They just -- the idea is the autonomous data warehouse makes database administration very simple. In fact, it's entirely automated. There is no database administration. Delgado Auto Taxi, again, in APAC, a smaller company, again, moving their databases to autonomous system. MaxiTRANS, big transportation company in Australia, same thing, autonomous transaction processing. The Scroll, a big Japanese wholesale company, autonomous -- moving to autonomous database.Banco Safra, this is -- by the way, this is not -- our CEO does not own a bank. This is not an internal -- she didn't not buy our database. But there's a big bank in Latin America called Banco Safra and they're moving all their mission-critical apps to OCI, as is Bradesco, same thing. Yorkshire Building Society in the UK, again, autonomous data warehouse. And NestlÃ©, a food giant in EMEA is moving their analytics systems to autonomous data warehouse and that's a huge customer. Okay. I mentioned a couple of calls ago that we have a new version of our MySQL open source database, and we added a new ultrafast query processor called HeatWave to MySQL and that's doing extremely well. We have a number of companies doing that migration. Medallia, Infonow Credit Club.It's a long list of people that are moving to MySQL to take advantage of the fact that our query processor in our version of MySQL is 100 times faster. I really mean that. And we have all the benchmarks. We publish all the benchmarks, and we publish the source code of the benchmarks, so you can duplicate those results, 100 times faster than queries than the Amazon equivalent called Aurora; Aurora, Amazon's version of MySQL. As Safra mentioned earlier, our partnership with Microsoft Azure is going extremely well. We have a number of companies running applications in Azure. And then Azure is connected to OCI, so the database is in OCI and the application is in Azure. The Belgium Railways is one. Honeywell in the United States, Petronas the big energy and utility company, Telecom Italia Mobile A , but that multi-cloud system is doing extremely well.And we think that is the future of cloud. We think the future of cloud is not 4-walled gardens, AWS, Microsoft, Google and Oracle. We think those clouds are all going to interconnect. And then customers will pick the most appropriate service for their particular needs and mix and match between the clouds. Okay. A lot more -- a major city in the southwest, which I'm not allowed to mention is literally migrating everything to OCI. Lambda, which is a big AI machine learning specialist company is moving the bulk of their workloads to OCI using NVIDIA GPUs and our fast -- our very, very fast network to interconnect them. And this is a pattern. Lambda is doing that, Latent Space is doing that. NVIDIA themselves are doing that. So we're seeing a lot of machine learning and artificial intelligence workloads moving from other clouds to OCI because we're faster.And again, in the cloud business faster -- when you charge by the minute, faster means cheaper. Give me 1 second. Alexa, be quite. Sorry about that. I think Jeff Bezos did that. Okay. So, Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, National Institute of Health. These are all new cloud customers, new infrastructure cloud customers -- again from very large to medium-sized companies are moving to OCI and lots of them. Twist Biosciences is moving healthcare -- again, AI workloads to OCI using NVIDIA GPUs. AIA Life Insurance Company, a big financial services company, again, is moving to OCI and databases to OCI. In India, Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation, a giant utility, is moving all of their metering and billing applications to OCI. Win Win Intelligent Information Technology is moving their IoT platform from AWS to OCI, and they're also using MySQL HeatWave.Algar Telecom, Brazilian Stock Exchange, Claro, again, big media telco, moving to OCI; Ncell. Unimed Curitiba, a large health care company in Latin America moving to OCI; Vivo, again, moving to OCI. Banco de Chile, E-Banks another financial services company; Rabobank. DP World, the transportation and logistics company in the Middle East, Austin TranSit Partnership, a municipality in Texas they're perfect -- an interesting customer because they've been using Oracle ERP and EPM and our applications for a long time. Now they're moving their infrastructure to OCI. Oman Telecommunications. A huge French telecommunication company, I'm not allowed to mention. They're moving to OCI. Oxford Nanopore, a big -- a gene sequencing company is moving from AWS to OCI where they are going to store gene sequencing, but not only just store gene sequences in OCI, they also do analytics to figure out if -- what they've sequenced is a new version of COVID-19 or another pathogen, if the pathogen they've never seen before, extremely important application for world health.Reed Exhibitions, Saudi Ministry of Media, Ecobank, financial services in EMEA, GlobeMed Limited, Morrisons, a big retail operation, again, all moving to on OCI. HDFC Bank and Waafi Bank, I'm going to stop there, but we published a long list, but there's tremendous momentum, tremendous momentum and a large number of customers from all over the world, very large and medium-sized companies moving to OCI, and the business is growing very strongly, as Safra pointed out in the numbers. Okay. In the back -- in applications, I'll try to do this quickly. We're just winning in the back office. We have 22,000 customers in infrastructure and the cloud. We have 11,000 Fusion ERP and HCM customers alone in applications, just Fusion customers. We have 11,000 now.We have probably close to 30,000, 30,000 NetSuite customers on top of that. So, we have a lot of customers and applications. We've been in the Applications Cloud business for longer than we've been in the infrastructure cloud business. We're extremely strong in healthcare, Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, Mount Sinai, Providence Saint Joseph, Adventist Health, Kaiser Permanente, National Health Service in the UK, long list of providers, that's a partial list, are using Oracle ERP, supply chain and HCM applications. But it's not just the clinical providers that are using our systems, the payers, the healthcare payers. So again, as we tackle healthcare with -- in conjunction with our Cerner acquisition, we're not just automating providers, we're also automating payers.We're also automating pharmaceutical companies as they do clinical trials. We're trying, to automate the entire ecosystem, not just a fraction of it. So I mentioned a list of providers and payers, UnitedHealthcare, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Humana, Highmark Health, Health Care Service Corporations, Independence Blue Cross, Bright Health, so payers as well as providers. We're extremely strong in that. I mean, we -- again, I'll just leave it with extremely strong. Healthcare wins in the quarter in Q2, Cigna, a huge payer win; Emirates Health Services, big provider where we beat SAP; Cross Country Health Services where we beat Workday and SAP. Henry Schein is a provider of healthcare products for -- and there -- we won there. But again, it is the entire healthcare infrastructure that we are focusing on as we try to automate healthcare systems around the world.Go-lives, go-lives in the quarter, Tenet Health, 65 hospitals, 235,000 employees, they went live on HR payroll and recruiting. Cleveland Clinic, is going live. I know it's called Cleveland Clinic, but they also -- they own hospitals all over the place. They've gone live in a bunch of regional hospitals in Florida. University of Chicago Medical Center has gone live. Baptist Health Care has gone live, 12 hospitals with 26,000 employees. Lakeview Center has gone live in the quarter. So, we're just getting stronger and stronger in health care. And so, let me move on to financial services, our other -- another industry that we deem very, very strategic and key to Oracle's future is financial services, specifically banking. And we're very, very strong there, Bank of -- in terms of ERP, HCM, supply chain, our customers include Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of New York Mellon, Vanguard, Santander, TD Bank in Canada, HSBC in the UK, UBS, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, Credit Suisse, Sumitomo Mitsui.It's a partial list. We are extremely strong in the banking sector. And what you're going to see in Oracle ERP with our strength in the banking sector is we will be offering loan origination for B2B commerce. One of the things we're doing with the new version of Oracle ERP is if you're a customer that's buying something and you have Oracle ERP, and we -- and you are a company that's selling something and you have Oracle ERP, the way that B2B transaction will occur, it will be entirely automated within the cloud. So you'll submit a purchase order, the buying ERP system will submit a purchase order to the selling ERP system. And if you need to borrow money, we will originate a loan with one of our banking partners. If the product has to be shipped, we will schedule the shipping and track the shipment with one of our logistic partners.And our ambition here is to completely automate B2B commerce between buying and selling companies that are running Oracle Cloud ERP and manage all of the financing and insurance and logistics associated with that transaction. We do a really good job, I think, of automating B2C transactions. Amazon does that extremely well. Walmart does that extremely well. But we don't do a great job of automating B2B transactions. And that's what Oracle's ambition is to do that. And we're in a great position because we are so strong in cloud ERP. So, it's an Oracle system that's -- an Oracle procurement system on one end of that transaction. It's an Oracle order management system on the other end of that transaction. We have very strong partners in finance, insurance and logistics so we can completely automate the entire transaction, where B2B transactions begin to look like B2C transactions.They're fully end-to-end automated. And that's a huge new business for us and our partners. Okay. Let's see. Financial Services wins in the quarter. We've added M&amp;T Bank, TD Bank, Daiwa Securities -- Farmers Insurance. Nexi, which is where we replaced SAP at Nexi, it's an Italian bank. We replaced SAP at TD Bank. Let's see what else. Financial services go lives. AmTrust, BlackRock, a big go live. They are -- they have $10 trillion of managed assets. Oracle now has 9 of the top 10 asset management firms, running on the Oracle Cloud ERP. FirstRand Bank, a bunch of other banks. I don't want to take up all the time. So, I'm going to stop there. We have a lot more data on our website that will tell you -- that will enumerate still more customers that we acquired in this very strong second quarter and that went live in the second quarter.With that, I'm going to turn it back over to Safra.Ken Bond: Thank you, Larry. Bo, if you could prepare the audience for Q&amp;A. Appreciate it.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Their dividends provide extra returns for portfolios that have been battered in a very difficult 2022. Further, they provide income that can be used to offset the effects of stubbornly-high inflation that continues to eat into finances. In short, dividend-bearing stocks are one of the smartest approaches stock investors have available currently. The same is true in strong economies as well. Dividend stocks tend to perform strongly in all markets which is why a long-term investment perspective benefits considerably from such shares. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsReliable, established companies tend to pay dividends as well, meaning they simply have better business models. And that’s where investors should place their capital. VFCVF Corp $28.20MOAltria $46.71PGProcter &amp; Gamble $150.92CVXChevron $168.00MCDMcDonald’s $272.04KMBKimberly-Clark $136.20PSAPublic Storage $297.60VF Corp (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comVF Corp (NYSE:VFC) stock has had a difficult time in 2022. In fact, it has shed more than 61% of its value year-to-date. That shouldn’t normally inspire much optimism but VF Corp oversees a portfolio of apparel brands that should perform well this holiday season. The company’s brand portfolio includes North Face, Vans, Timberland, Dickies, Supreme and others. Although the company’s earnings have fallen its revenues remain on firm footing for the remainder of the fiscal year. The company anticipates revenues increasing 5-6% this year as long as consumer sentiment doesn’t worsen. So far, that looks to be the case. The National Retail Federation anticipates a healthy holiday season with spending levels 6-8% higher than those in 2021. Its North Face brand has performed well in the first half, with revenues increasing 15% year over year. It stands to reason that North Face products will sell well in the colder months of this holiday season. Yes, VFC has fallen substantially and that is indicative of risk. However, it comes with a 6.03% dividend and could do very well in the next few months.  Story continuesAltria (MO)Altria office sign in Virginia capital city tobacco business closeup by road streetSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.comSin stocks like Altria (NYSE:MO) tend to do well in difficult economic periods. That means the cigarette maker should be experiencing a boost sooner or later. Yet, smoking rates continue to decline after experiencing a dramatic decrease over the last decade. That indicates that Altria, which depends on cigarettes for 90% of revenues, more than its competitors, needs to pivot to remain relevant. It can, and while it does it’ll pay investors a high-yield dividend. In fact, that dividend is the highest on this list, at 8.03%. Investors should be interested in Altria for that dividend and then hope that it can develop products to diversify its revenue. Diversification costs money, thus depending upon resources being directed to such efforts. Fortunately, Altria has options. In 2024, the company will receive a $2.7 billion payment from Phillip Morris (NYSE:PMI) for a product tie-up. It also owns 10% of Anheuser-Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD). It can sell that to fund the development of smokeless products. So, hope for the pivot and take advantage of the dividend. Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Shopping cartProcter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a consumer packaged goods giant proving that certain stocks reliably fare better than others. Case in point: PG shares are down 7% year to date. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen more than 15% during the same period. Procter &amp; Gamble’s performance becomes even more appealing when its dividend is considered. In 2022, Procter &amp; Gamble paid dividends of $3.61 for each share of its stock held. So, when that is considered, PG stock has only fallen by 6% this year, again, much better when compared to the 15% S&amp;P 500 declines. Procter &amp; Gamble’s dividend is ultra-reliable, last having been reduced in 1957. Whatever happens in 2023, investors should understand that Procter &amp; Gamble performs well in any weather. During its most recent financial reporting period, sales increased a modest 1% while EPS declined 2%. That may not sound particularly appealing to investors, but it is far better than many other firms, particularly those in growth sectors like tech. McDonald’s (MCD)McDonald's golden archesSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / ShutterstockPurchasing McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock might put off some investors since discretionary spending tends to fall in weaker economic periods. Consumers spend less where they can and restaurant performance tends to do worse as a result. Inflation tends to get passed on to consumers as well, driving food prices higher. Resulting in yet another reason to dismiss restaurant stocks whether they have a dividend or not. However, McDonald’s operates a franchising business system that makes it somewhat different from the average restaurant stock. McDonald’s profits are padded by franchisee rents and royalties that are calculated from sales. That means McDonald’s can rely on a heavy rental income while also deriving high royalties from its best-performing locations. It’s a clever business model that serves the corporation very well. That means the company will remain well insulated from broad issues into 2023 and beyond. MCD stock is up this year, making it a rare performer. In addition, it pays a 2.22% dividend. Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) has been among the very best-performing stocks in 2022. Volatile energy prices have greatly benefited the oil &amp; gas major resulting in exceptional earnings, especially in the last two quarters. In Q3, Chevron reported $11.2 billion in earnings as higher energy prices positively affected the firm. That represented a significant increase over the $6.1 billion in earnings Chevron reported a year earlier. The strong performance has resulted in share prices that have made a lot of investors a lot of money this year. In short, CVX stock started 2022 at $103 and it now trades above $180. The good news is that analysts believe, by consensus, that CVX stock should trade at $192 moving forward. The good times aren’t over for the company based on EPS projections for Q4. 3 months ago it was expected that Chevron would post EPS figures of $4.48 in Q4. That has steadily risen and now sits at $4.51. Chevron’s dividend pays 3.12% on a forward basis and its 0.32 payout ratio is extremely sustainable for the firm meaning it will pay investors. Kimberly-Clark (KMB)Kimberly Clark (KMB) sign, positioned outside the world headquarters’ main entrance.Source: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.comKimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) stock has fallen a modest 4.4% throughout 2022, proving that non-durable consumer staples continue to be a wise investment. Including Kimberly-Clark’s dividend, the stock has declined less than 1% throughout the year. Back to the notion that non-durable consumer staples make for good investments. Consumer staples are goods that can be considered essential products for consumers. The category includes food and drinks, household goods, and hygiene products like those that Kimberly-Clark sells. Kimberly-Clark sells leading paper towel brands including Cottonelle, Scott and Viva. It also sells hygiene products under leading names including Huggies, Kleenex and Depends. Consumer demand for such goods remains stable no matter the economic conditions. Consumers do trade down, however, Kimberly-Clark has value offerings to address that fluctuation.   The first nine months of 2022 saw revenues increase 5% to $15.211 billion. And despite rising costs across the board, net income only declined a modest 2%. Public Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comPublic Storage (NYSE:PSA) stock benefits from a potential tailwind in 2023 that isn’t nice to consider but may happen nonetheless. That scenario is worth considering and makes it attractive in addition to its 2.7% dividend which hasn’t been reduced since 1992. Public Storage operates more than 200 million square feet of self-storage space across the U.S. Let’s assume a 2023 recession occurs as the majority of economists expect. That will lead to increased rates of homelessness as rents become untenable. People will move their belongings into storage units while they look to improve their situations. That hypothetical situation benefits Public Storage. Even without such an unfortunate tailwind, Public Storage is doing well. Rental income increased 15.2% in the third quarter, reaching $795.7 million. Total revenue increased by a similar 15.4% during the same period. Share prices have fallen from $365 to begin 2022. The company increased its footprint by 25% during the most recent quarter and maintains the highest operating margins in the self-storage industry making 2023 look strong. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

330,4bf37dd5-1260-3a5d-9c04-910bc45d7b0e,MU,2022-12-15,Earnings Preview: Micron (MU) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-micron-mu-q1-150003517.html,1671030003,STORY,['MU'],"[The market expects Micron (MU) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended November 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on December 21, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis chipmaker is expected to post break-even quarterly earnings per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -100%.Revenues are expected to be $4.11 billion, down 46.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 50.25% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Micron?For Micron, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1,412.50%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Micron will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Micron would post earnings of $1.40 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.45, delivering a surprise of +3.57%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Micron doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

FIS on Thursday said it had now appointed Jeffrey Goldstein, currently lead independent director, as independent chairman instead.The changes come after weeks of discussions with D.E.

Shaw, which oversees $60 billion in assets and occasionally pushes for changes at companies, urged FIS to assess its business configuration and structure in light of the company's substantial valuation discount to its peers.Story continuesThe hedge fund also wanted to see changes on the board and an accelerated pace of change in the executive suite, people familiar with the talks said.Activist investment firm Jana Partners had also made an investment in FIS and approached the company recently to push for a strategic review that could possibly see the company broken up and for immediate changes in the C-suite, one of the sources familiar with the matter said.The two activists did not know of the other's plans or proposals, the sources said.When D.E. Shaw encourages corporate boards to rethink strategy, the hedge fund prefers to conduct talks out of the limelight and often surfaces publicly only after an agreement has been signed.

But what chains are hiking their prices the most? Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma diving into this one for us. And Brooke, what did you find? And I'm sure a lot of people, if they go to those chains, aren't going to be too happy.BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah, not going to be too happy, and certainly, while food away from home actually is up 8.5% compared to the food at home up 12%, according to the latest CPI report, so consumers looking to dine out on a dime here. But when you look at just the numbers from the price transparency platform, pricelisto.com, they found that across the board at some of the top food chains, they're actually seeing menu price increases up double digits.Wendy's up 35%, Chick-Fil-A up 15.6%, Taco Bell up 14.6%. Burger King, some good news, they're only up 2%. But McDonald's actually, surprisingly, pricelisto found down 5%. Now they gathered the data from in-store visits, phone interviews, and also they collected it from business owners who then uploaded their data onto the site. I was surprised, too, Dave. I know.DAVE BRIGGS: [INAUDIBLE]SEANA SMITH: I was surprised, too.BROOKE DIPALMA: It's hard to make sense, right? Right? Because we've heard over and over on these analyst calls that they're raising prices because it costs more to transport the goods. Ultimately, the goods at the core cost more. We're hearing chicken costs more year over year. But those were some of the staggering increases. And if you take a closer look at the average item price, those numbers also higher. Wendy's coming in at the most expensive. Taco Bell, still can dine on a dime there, about 3.37 for the average item price.DAVE BRIGGS: Quickly, any theories on how McDonald's went down?Story continuesBROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah, see, I was interested in that, too. And based upon what they're telling me, basically, we saw some items go down, like-- I don't have it in front of me exactly, but just certain examples, they said that they basically they ticked down because of the aggregation between the Big Mac, as well as the French fries, and just different items that they actually year over year was down in price. And therefore, they found that the average year over year was down. I was surprised as well.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, I hadn't noticed those price increases when I do go to those places, I must say.SEANA SMITH: I was gonna say, Wendy's, 35%.BROOKE DIPALMA: It just slides right by. Slides right by.DAVE BRIGGS: Great to see you. Thanks so much.]"

If you want to see more best blue chip stocks that outperformed in 2022, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.2022 has been a challenging year for the markets as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates substantially to fight inflation. As a result of the interest rate increases, demand for some companies have weakened and valuations in the overall market have decreased as capital has moved from equities to Treasuries.With the headwinds, all three of the major market indexes have declined year to date in 2022 with the S&amp;P 500 down 16.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 6.77%, and the tech heavy Nasdaq down 28.9%.Of the three indexes, it's not surprising that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen the least given that the index is comprised of blue chip stocks.Blue chip stocks are stocks of well-known leading companies with substantial competitive advantages. Many blue chips have strong histories of increasing earnings over time and returning capital back to shareholders through dividends or stock repurchases.While the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have blue chip stocks as well, the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ index include many medium sized and smaller companies that the Dow Jones Industrial Average doesn't.November Inflation DataWhile the three indexes are down this year, the market has rallied since October as inflation has shown signs of potentially peaking.For the month of November, the consumer price index rose 7.1% year over year versus estimates of an increase of 7.3% year over year. Meanwhile, the core CPI rose only 6% year over year on an annual basis versus estimates of 6.1% year over year. The better than expected inflation numbers for November followed better than expected numbers for October as well.Given the recent inflation numbers, it remains to be seen what the Federal Reserve will do in the near term as the U.S. central bank has said one month of good data isn't enough.Story continuesFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in November, ""While October inflation data received so far showed a welcome surprise to the downside, these are a single month's data, which followed upside surprises over the previous two months. As figure 1 makes clear, down months in the data have often been followed by renewed increases. It will take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining. By any standard, inflation remains much too high.""If two months isn't good enough either and the Federal Reserve raises rates too much, it could slow the economy and cause a recession next year. If economic data fails to meet expectations, there could be more downside.If rates don't go up too much further, however, the economic slowdown might not be as bad as expected. Given the market decline so far, the stocks of some quality blue chips could trade for attractive valuations in the long term as a result.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks That Outperformed in 2022, we took 12 of the best performing Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks in terms of their year to date performance.We then ranked them based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Best Blue Chip Stocks That Outperformed in 202212.

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.61% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.42%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.17%.Heading into today, shares of the package delivery service had gained 1.31% over the past month, lagging the Transportation sector's gain of 1.39% and outpacing the S&amp;P 500's gain of 0.89% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from United Parcel Service as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $3.59, unchanged from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $28.09 billion, up 1.16% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $12.91 per share and revenue of $101.4 billion, which would represent changes of +6.43% and +4.23%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for United Parcel Service. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. United Parcel Service is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Looking at its valuation, United Parcel Service is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 14.24. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 12.4, so we one might conclude that United Parcel Service is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that UPS currently has a PEG ratio of 1.71.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Wells Fargo (WFC) earns a Zacks Rank #3 30 days from its next quarterly earnings release on January 13, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.40 a share.WFC has an Earnings ESP figure of 10.72%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.40 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26.WFC is just one of a large group of Finance stocks with a positive ESP figure. American Express (AXP) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.American Express, which is readying to report earnings on January 24, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $2.25 a share, and AXP is 41 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Express is $2.15, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 4.49%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, WFC and AXP could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

If you want to read about some more stocks that members of Congress own, go directly to 5 Stocks That Members of Congress Own.It is no secret that stock trading has generally been considered a side-benefit to winning a seat in the United States Congress. Although these trades by lawmakers were not available to the public for scrutiny before, they have been since 2012, as the STOCK Act of 2012 mandates that lawmakers disclose these trades publicly. An analysis of these trades by the New York Times has found that at least 97 current members of Congress bought or sold stock, bonds or other financial assets that intersected with their congressional work. It is important to clarify that US lawmakers are not banned from investing in any company, including those companies that could be affected by their decisions. However, such calls have grown in the past few years as the trading activities of lawmakers become controversial. Public outrage over congressional stock trading intensified in recent years after revelations that four senators had sold stocks in 2020 after private briefings on the risks of a coronavirus outbreak in the United States. Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in September 2022 that she would support a floor vote on legislation that would ban members of Congress and their family members from dealing in individual stocks while those lawmakers are in office. Pelosi had earlier gone against such a vote. Some of the top stocks that US Congress members presently own include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), among others. The US Congress has postponed a vote regarding the ban on stock trading for lawmakers until after the midterm elections. Photo by MIKE STOLL on UnsplashOur MethodologyThe companies listed below were picked from the Periodic Transaction Report(s) that US politicians who trade stocks are obliged to file. It is important to clarify that the stocks listed below were picked from the public record of investments Congress members and their families have made in the past few months. The purchases may not have been made by the members themselves but only disclosed on behalf of their families. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continuesStocks That Members of Congress Own15.

(NASDAQ:NTAP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Technology remains important in our portfolios, although the sector weights have come down over the past year. We now hold NetApp (NTAP) which has strong growth prospects, yet attractive valuations in our view. Unlike many younger tech companies, we believe our holdings should significantly benefit from an upturn in the economy.”12. Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40    Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) develops, manufactures, and markets household, personal care, and specialty products.

(NYSE:ACN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The largest new purchases include Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN). Accenture modestly lagged the market last quarter and became similarly attractive enough to warrant ownership. Similar to our prior presentations, one way to visualize the current portfolio and note recent changes versus the benchmark is to look at a scatter plot of all of Distillate’s FSV holdings versus those in the benchmark with the valuation on the vertical axis and free cash ϲow stability on the horizontal axis.”10. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58    Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) operates a platform that enables hosts to offer stays and experiences to guests worldwide.

(NASDAQ:ABNB) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) was one of our largest detractors from performance in the second quarter. Airbnb is the clear market leader in private rental bookings globally, according to market research firm Euromonitor. The business is currently firing on all cylinders, with revenue and earnings growth well above our expectations and long-term estimates. It would be easy to say that it is because as the world reopens, people are traveling for the first time in two years, providing a short-term benefit to the company.

We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest Dividend Cuts and Suspensions of 2022.  Suggested articles:10 Best Medical Stocks Under $2015 Countries That Produce the Most Solar Energy11 Undervalued Canadian Stocks To BuyDisclosure.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Stocks Most Affected by Inflation.Inflation in the US is hovering around a four-decade high, and this has caused experts to investigate its impact on different corporations. The first takeaway is that companies that are cyclical in nature and can pass on price increases to customers can safeguard their margins during periods of raging inflation. As a result, they experience growth and expansion during inflationary periods. On the other hand, companies that are carrying high levels of debt and are sensitive to interest rate changes come under pressure. This is because, during periods of high inflation, it is a common practice to increase benchmark interest rates to bring inflation under control, which leads to highly leveraged entities incurring increased financing costs. According to the financial services firm Allianz, sectors like consumer staples and utilities have had an inverse correlation with inflation rates as these businesses utilize resources that raise the cost of their inputs. In general, this has had a negative impact on their stock prices and margins. In contrast, businesses in the materials and energy industries traditionally have had a positive correlation with inflation. Inflation also causes challenges for technology companies undergoing the growth phase. However, the decline for technology companies has been much softer as compared to the dot com bubble burst in the early 2000s.Inflation was a key topic during the Q3 2022 earnings season as well as it was discussed by the majority of the companies during their conference calls. Depending on the nature of the businesses, companies were impacted differently by inflation. Numerous leading companies were able to surpass consensus top-line and bottom-line expectations for Q3 2022 as they were able to pass the price increases on to the customers and control their cost structure, despite experiencing a decline in unit sales. In contrast, companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) observed rising raw material costs, resulting in a contraction in margins. As of November, inflation grew by 7.7% YoY in the US as opposed to the Federal Reserve’s long-term target of 2% only.Story continues10 Stocks Most Affected by InflationOur MethodologyWe have analyzed the earnings reports, analyst ratings, and growth prospects of the companies to shortlist the 10 stocks most affected by inflation. While some of these companies have strong fundamentals, the raging inflation has had a strong negative impact on their operations and financial strength. We have ranked these stocks in terms of the level of hedge fund ownership as of Q3 2022.10 Stocks Most Affected by Inflation10. Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) is a Los Angeles, California-based producer of plant-based meat alternatives for the vegan community.The company, founded in 2009, has come under intense pressure due to declining demand for its products. The decline in demand has caused Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) to cut its revenue guidance for FY22. Furthermore, the company has been forced to lay off 200 employees to control its costs. On December 9, Kristina Ruggeri at Argus downgraded Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) stock from a Hold to a Sell rating as the analyst observed a diminishing demand due to high inflation. The analyst also observed that the rise in prices is causing customers to trade down to more economical choices. Ms. Ruggeri added that Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) has also been adversely impacted by an increase in competition as other players have emerged in the plant-based meat substitute industry.Here's what Horos Asset Management said about Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“What about the other asset class that has attracted the most attention from the investment community in recent times? Beyond Meat is the other company whose valuations we did not understand and whose share price has also declined drastically in the last year and a half.”9. Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) is a Benton Harbor, Michigan-based producer and seller of home appliances products.Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) observed a major dent in the consumption of its products during Q3 2022 due to high inflation. This caused the company to miss the top-line and bottom-line estimates for the quarter. Furthermore, Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) has forecasted a period of softer demand moving forward, as increasing inflation is expected to have an impact on the consumers' budgets in 2023 as well.In a research note issued to investors on October 26, Elizabeth Suzuki at Bank of America downgraded Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) stock from a Neutral to an Underperform rating with a target price of $119 as opposed to the previous target price of $156. The revised target price represents a potential downside of over 17% from the closing price of December 13. The analyst observed that the company data reflects that there has been a significant decline in the sale of appliances.8. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) is an operator of cryptocurrency exchanges that have been severely impacted by rising inflation.The price of the two notable cryptocurrencies in the form of Bitcoin and Ethereum have lost nearly 60% of their value YTD. The sharp decline has led investors to bear heavy losses and liquidate their positions in the cryptocurrency universe. The sentiments of cryptocurrency investors are expected to remain depressed next year and in 2024 as well.Based on these developments, Dan Dolev at Mizuho downgraded Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) stock from a Neutral to an Underperform rating on December 9. The analyst also reduced the target price by more than 28% from $42 to $30. The reduced target price is 25% lower than the last closing price of December 13. The significant downward revision in target price has been due to Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) slashing the revenue and EBITDA forecast for 2024 by 18% and 64%, respectively.Here's what Hayden Capital said about Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN): The crypto ecosystem moves extremely quickly, and there’s been many new developments since we first invested in Coinbase, a year ago. Most notably, crypto market cap has declined from a peak of ~$3 Trillion last fall, to ~$1.1 Trillion today (a -63% decline, and -72% peak-to-trough; LINK). Crypto is a volatile asset class, and has experienced many draw-downs of similar magnitude in the past. For example, Bitcoin was down -93% during 2011, -85% from 2013-15, and -84% from 2017-18. In this context, the latest draw-down is a pretty normal outcome for this emerging asset class.A large reason for this volatility, is simply because there aren’t any major “real-world use cases” for the asset just yet. In our letter outlining the investment last year, we wrote that crypto is still “in the middle of ‘crossing the chasm’ into mainstream adoption &amp; use cases, which will result in millions of mainstream users needing to transact crypto in some form”…” (Click here to see the full text)7.

The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $4 billion.Third Point mentioned Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its recently-published Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)8.

HD is an attractive bet for the long term, owing to its strong fundamentals, robust housing market trends and continued investments. The company looks well-poised to gain from the strength in its digital business and efforts to improve the Pro experience.Home Depot stands to capitalize on the demand for home improvement projects, driven by its interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure that have helped consistently boost web traffic for the past few quarters.These investments and endeavors have helped the company deliver consistently strong earnings performances. It reported sales and earnings beat for the 10th straight quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2022. The top and bottom lines also improved year over year.However, Home Depot reported a soft gross margin in the fiscal third quarter, driven by higher supply-chain investments. Higher inventory levels and interest expenses also remain concerning.Shares of Home Depot have rallied 22.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 16.6%. The stock’s performance also compared favorably against the Retail-Wholesale sector’s fall of 3.8% and the S&amp;P 500’s growth of 1.6% in the same period.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s current financial year’s sales and earnings suggests growth of 4.2% and 7.2%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported number. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Home Depot’s Strategies on TrackHome Depot is witnessing significant benefits from the execution of the “One Home Depot” investment plan, which focuses on expanding supply-chain facilities, technology investments and enhancement to the digital experience. The interconnected retail strategy and underlying technology infrastructure have helped consistently boost web traffic for the past few quarters.Sales, leveraging digital platforms, rose 10% year over year in the fiscal third quarter. Enhanced search capabilities and improved Pro site experience, and more robust fulfillment capabilities have been driving improved online conversions.The company’s strategy of providing an interconnected experience is resonating well with customers, as around 50% of the online orders were fulfilled through stores in the fiscal third quarter. Over the years, the company has created the fastest, most efficient delivery network in home improvement through options like buy online pickup in store with convenient pickup lockers, buy online deliver from store with express car and van delivery, and curbside pickup.Home Depot’s Pro segment has also been a key growth driver, with the Pro segment witnessing robust sales growth for the past several quarters. Pro sales growth outpaced DIY sales in the fiscal third quarter, driven by robust project demand across the business. The company expects continued sales growth from Pros as project demand is strong and their backlogs are growing.In the fiscal third quarter, HD witnessed big-ticket strength across many Pro-heavy categories like fasteners, pipe and fittings, and gypsum. The company remains on track with its investments to build a Pro ecosystem that includes professional-grade products, exclusive brands, enhanced delivery, credit, digital capabilities, field sales support and HD rental.The company continues to invest in Pro capabilities like enhanced fulfillment, more personalized online experience, and other business management tools to drive deeper engagement with Pro customers. The company is impressed with the momentum in its pro extra loyalty program.The company remains on track with the building of a unique, interconnected pro ecosystem and expects this to increase its ability to expand its share in a $450-billion addressable pro space.Home Depot’s guidance for fiscal 2022 is impressive. HD anticipates year-over-year sales and comps growth of 3% for fiscal 2022. Our estimate for HD’s fiscal 2022 sales stands at $157.3 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 4.1%. We estimate comps growth of 3.2% for fiscal 2022.We expect the company’s operating margin to be 15.4% in fiscal 2022, in sync with management’s guidance. HD estimates earnings per share growth in the mid-single digits for fiscal 2022. We anticipate earnings per share for fiscal 2022 to be $16.57, suggesting a 6.7% year-over-year increase.Story continuesHeadwinds to AddressHome Depot has been witnessing significant cost headwinds due to higher supply-chain investments. This, along with higher transportation and product cost pressures, has been denting margins. The gross profit margin contracted 10 basis points (bps) to 34% from 34.1% in the year-ago quarter mainly due to higher supply-chain investments.The company has been making efforts to offset transportation and product cost pressures, while maintaining value for customers. Driven by these efforts, we anticipate the gross margin for fiscal 2022 to be flat year over year at 33.6%.Moreover, the company is witnessing a rise in inventory due to product cost inflation and strategic decisions in response to continued global supply-chain disruption. The inventory increase also stems from intentional investments in higher in-stock levels and pull forward of inventory for events in the back half of the year due to the ongoing global supply-chain disruptions, investment in its new supply chain facilities, and carryover of some spring seasonal inventory.The increased inventory levels may be concerning for Home Depot if the housing environment deteriorates and consumers halt remodeling projects.Stocks to Bet OnWe highlighted three better-ranked stocks in the Retail - Wholesale sector, namely Tecnoglass TGLS, Build-A-Bear Workshop BBW and Ulta Beauty ULTA.Tecnoglass manufactures and sells architectural glass and windows, and aluminum products for the residential and commercial construction industries.

The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)8.

The two most impacted Coho stocks includes Philip Morris International, which essentially derives all of its revenues outside the U.S. Harkening back to Table 1, the decline in Philip Morris earnings for 2022 versus the reported earnings in 2021 is entirely related to the strengthening dollar.

If you want to see more best blue chip stocks that outperformed in 2022, go directly to 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.2022 has been a challenging year for the markets as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates substantially to fight inflation. As a result of the interest rate increases, demand for some companies have weakened and valuations in the overall market have decreased as capital has moved from equities to Treasuries.With the headwinds, all three of the major market indexes have declined year to date in 2022 with the S&amp;P 500 down 16.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 6.77%, and the tech heavy Nasdaq down 28.9%.Of the three indexes, it's not surprising that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen the least given that the index is comprised of blue chip stocks.Blue chip stocks are stocks of well-known leading companies with substantial competitive advantages. Many blue chips have strong histories of increasing earnings over time and returning capital back to shareholders through dividends or stock repurchases.While the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have blue chip stocks as well, the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ index include many medium sized and smaller companies that the Dow Jones Industrial Average doesn't.November Inflation DataWhile the three indexes are down this year, the market has rallied since October as inflation has shown signs of potentially peaking.For the month of November, the consumer price index rose 7.1% year over year versus estimates of an increase of 7.3% year over year. Meanwhile, the core CPI rose only 6% year over year on an annual basis versus estimates of 6.1% year over year. The better than expected inflation numbers for November followed better than expected numbers for October as well.Given the recent inflation numbers, it remains to be seen what the Federal Reserve will do in the near term as the U.S. central bank has said one month of good data isn't enough.Story continuesFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in November, ""While October inflation data received so far showed a welcome surprise to the downside, these are a single month's data, which followed upside surprises over the previous two months. As figure 1 makes clear, down months in the data have often been followed by renewed increases. It will take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining. By any standard, inflation remains much too high.""If two months isn't good enough either and the Federal Reserve raises rates too much, it could slow the economy and cause a recession next year. If economic data fails to meet expectations, there could be more downside.If rates don't go up too much further, however, the economic slowdown might not be as bad as expected. Given the market decline so far, the stocks of some quality blue chips could trade for attractive valuations in the long term as a result.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks That Outperformed in 2022, we took 12 of the best performing Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks in terms of their year to date performance.We then ranked them based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares in the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Best Blue Chip Stocks That Outperformed in 202212.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221214005274/en/The Coca-Cola Company has teamed up with two of the most legendary names in the history of music sampling, Mark Ronson and Madlib, to bring a bold musical experiment to life with the launch of Recycled Records. (Photo: Business Wire)The campaign introduces an original EP made up of the sounds taken from the bottle-to-bottle recycling process, alongside a versatile sound library and engaging short film. Not only will fans be able to listen to these uniquely made tracks, but they’ll also get the chance to re-mix the very same sound library used by the two musical legends into innovative compositions of their own through an interactive digital beat machine.Creative masters Mark Ronson and Madlib chopped, looped, and distorted recycled sounds, vocals, and ambient noises into an imaginative collection of six one-of-a-kind tracks to celebrate Sprite, Fresca and Seagram’s transition from green to clear packaging. From the percussion of a forklift beeping to the tonal beat of a conveyor belt to the hi-hat of air blown into a plastic bottle, the EP brings to life the magic of multiple reuses.""Sampling is an artform which is constantly regenerating. The tiniest sound, whether from an old record or from the world around us, can inspire an entire piece of music. I learnt from my heroes, DJ Premier and Q-Tip, who all made incredible albums from sampling, and it’s stayed an integral part of my work up until today,"" said GRAMMY®-award winning producer and sampling master Mark Ronson.Story continuesA sound sample is to music as clear plastic is to recycling. The process of music sampling is ongoing; an old sound is used in a new track, which is flipped again into a newer track, and so on. When green plastic is recycled, it is usually turned into single-use items that do not get recycled again – so, it was time for a moment of clarity. Now Sprite, Fresca and Seagram’s clear plastic bottles increase the likelihood of them being remade into new bottles.""A great sample doesn’t have to come from other music, it just has to make you move,"" said award-winning pioneer producer and legendary artist, Madlib, also known as the ""Loop Digga,"" ""Quasimoto"" and many other aliases. ""The thud of a plastic bottle going through a recycling facility is, in its own way, a piece of art, it has the ability to transform. Being able to take sounds from the recycling process that are so different from what I’ve used in the past, and flipping it into a whole new format, is a great example of the versatility of sound. Now any cat has the opportunity to make some dope sounds of their own.""To learn more, fans can look to critically acclaimed artist and female pioneer of rap, MC Lyte, who narrates a documentary-style short film that draws a clear connection between the heritage and spirit of music sampling and the closed loop recycling process. The captivating film, filled with rich soundscapes, imaginative beats and riveting visuals, showcases the creative process behind ""Recycled Records"" including extensive sound recordings at recycling facilities nationwide and a fascinating glimpse into the studios of Mark Ronson and Madlib.""The Coca-Cola Company is thrilled to have teamed up with Mark Ronson and Madlib to celebrate our portfolio’s transition from green to clear plastic. This sonic partnership is part of The Coca-Cola Company’s broader World Without Waste goals,"" said Kurt Ritter, Vice President and General Manager, Sustainability, The Coca-Cola Company North America. ""We’re excited about the switch because it increases the amount of high-quality, food-grade recycled plastic available in the marketplace and ultimately allows our brands to use more recycled plastic in their packaging.""Packaging innovation alone will not solve the plastic waste crisis. While the transition away from green plastic is one of many steps needed to drive a circular economy, The Coca-Cola Company recognizes it has a responsibility to keep evolving its process, and this is just one of the steps the company is taking to do so.Starting December 14th, consumers can join in on the magic of multiple uses by watching the film and taking the Recycled Records beat machine for a spin to create their own musical compositions at www.cokeurl.com/greentoclear.For further information, please contact:M&amp;C Saatchi Sport &amp; Entertainment North America, tcccsustainability@mcsaatchi.comAbout The Coca-Cola CompanyThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is a total beverage company with products sold in more than 200 countries and territories.

365,57ca8bfb-719f-3bb2-b167-5512129c5ccd,WHR,2022-12-15,Can Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) Improve Its Returns?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whirlpool-corporation-nyse-whr-improve-105102871.html,1671101462,STORY,['WHR'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Whirlpool How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Whirlpool is:9.0% = US$393m ÷ US$4.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.09.Does Whirlpool Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Whirlpool has a lower ROE than the average (23%) in the Consumer Durables industry.roeThat certainly isn't ideal. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for Whirlpool by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesWhirlpool's Debt And Its 9.0% ROEWhirlpool does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.14. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: Whirlpool may not be the best stock to buy.

366,ab6a353e-76f9-3f15-b1c1-e17b76c07d56,WHR,2022-12-15,10 Stocks Most Affected by Inflation,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-stocks-most-affected-inflation-192014284.html,1671045614,STORY,"['BYND', 'COIN', 'TSCO', 'WHR', 'PG', 'MET-PE']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 10 stocks most affected by inflation. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Stocks Most Affected by Inflation.Inflation in the US is hovering around a four-decade high, and this has caused experts to investigate its impact on different corporations. The first takeaway is that companies that are cyclical in nature and can pass on price increases to customers can safeguard their margins during periods of raging inflation. As a result, they experience growth and expansion during inflationary periods. On the other hand, companies that are carrying high levels of debt and are sensitive to interest rate changes come under pressure. This is because, during periods of high inflation, it is a common practice to increase benchmark interest rates to bring inflation under control, which leads to highly leveraged entities incurring increased financing costs. According to the financial services firm Allianz, sectors like consumer staples and utilities have had an inverse correlation with inflation rates as these businesses utilize resources that raise the cost of their inputs. In general, this has had a negative impact on their stock prices and margins. In contrast, businesses in the materials and energy industries traditionally have had a positive correlation with inflation. Inflation also causes challenges for technology companies undergoing the growth phase. However, the decline for technology companies has been much softer as compared to the dot com bubble burst in the early 2000s.Inflation was a key topic during the Q3 2022 earnings season as well as it was discussed by the majority of the companies during their conference calls. Depending on the nature of the businesses, companies were impacted differently by inflation. Numerous leading companies were able to surpass consensus top-line and bottom-line expectations for Q3 2022 as they were able to pass the price increases on to the customers and control their cost structure, despite experiencing a decline in unit sales. In contrast, companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) observed rising raw material costs, resulting in a contraction in margins. As of November, inflation grew by 7.7% YoY in the US as opposed to the Federal Reserve’s long-term target of 2% only.Story continues10 Stocks Most Affected by InflationOur MethodologyWe have analyzed the earnings reports, analyst ratings, and growth prospects of the companies to shortlist the 10 stocks most affected by inflation. While some of these companies have strong fundamentals, the raging inflation has had a strong negative impact on their operations and financial strength. We have ranked these stocks in terms of the level of hedge fund ownership as of Q3 2022.10 Stocks Most Affected by Inflation10. Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) is a Los Angeles, California-based producer of plant-based meat alternatives for the vegan community.The company, founded in 2009, has come under intense pressure due to declining demand for its products. The decline in demand has caused Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) to cut its revenue guidance for FY22. Furthermore, the company has been forced to lay off 200 employees to control its costs. On December 9, Kristina Ruggeri at Argus downgraded Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) stock from a Hold to a Sell rating as the analyst observed a diminishing demand due to high inflation. The analyst also observed that the rise in prices is causing customers to trade down to more economical choices. Ms. Ruggeri added that Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) has also been adversely impacted by an increase in competition as other players have emerged in the plant-based meat substitute industry.Here's what Horos Asset Management said about Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“What about the other asset class that has attracted the most attention from the investment community in recent times? Beyond Meat is the other company whose valuations we did not understand and whose share price has also declined drastically in the last year and a half.”9. Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) is a Benton Harbor, Michigan-based producer and seller of home appliances products.Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) observed a major dent in the consumption of its products during Q3 2022 due to high inflation. This caused the company to miss the top-line and bottom-line estimates for the quarter. Furthermore, Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) has forecasted a period of softer demand moving forward, as increasing inflation is expected to have an impact on the consumers' budgets in 2023 as well.In a research note issued to investors on October 26, Elizabeth Suzuki at Bank of America downgraded Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) stock from a Neutral to an Underperform rating with a target price of $119 as opposed to the previous target price of $156. The revised target price represents a potential downside of over 17% from the closing price of December 13. The analyst observed that the company data reflects that there has been a significant decline in the sale of appliances.8. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) is an operator of cryptocurrency exchanges that have been severely impacted by rising inflation.The price of the two notable cryptocurrencies in the form of Bitcoin and Ethereum have lost nearly 60% of their value YTD. The sharp decline has led investors to bear heavy losses and liquidate their positions in the cryptocurrency universe. The sentiments of cryptocurrency investors are expected to remain depressed next year and in 2024 as well.Based on these developments, Dan Dolev at Mizuho downgraded Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) stock from a Neutral to an Underperform rating on December 9. The analyst also reduced the target price by more than 28% from $42 to $30. The reduced target price is 25% lower than the last closing price of December 13. The significant downward revision in target price has been due to Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) slashing the revenue and EBITDA forecast for 2024 by 18% and 64%, respectively.Here's what Hayden Capital said about Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN): The crypto ecosystem moves extremely quickly, and there’s been many new developments since we first invested in Coinbase, a year ago. Most notably, crypto market cap has declined from a peak of ~$3 Trillion last fall, to ~$1.1 Trillion today (a -63% decline, and -72% peak-to-trough; LINK). Crypto is a volatile asset class, and has experienced many draw-downs of similar magnitude in the past. For example, Bitcoin was down -93% during 2011, -85% from 2013-15, and -84% from 2017-18. In this context, the latest draw-down is a pretty normal outcome for this emerging asset class.A large reason for this volatility, is simply because there aren’t any major “real-world use cases” for the asset just yet. In our letter outlining the investment last year, we wrote that crypto is still “in the middle of ‘crossing the chasm’ into mainstream adoption &amp; use cases, which will result in millions of mainstream users needing to transact crypto in some form”…” (Click here to see the full text)7. MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) is a New York-based provider of annuities, employee benefit programs, and insurance services. The company, founded in 1868, has a presence in over 60 countries with 90 million customers and has the distinction of being one of the biggest players in its industry.The rising inflation rate has triggered a domino effect for MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) as it has caused the benchmark interest rates to increase, leading to credit and capital concerns for the corporation. Furthermore, the possibility of higher claims related to the COVID-19 pandemic caused Suneet Kamath at Jefferies to downgrade MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) stock from a Buy to a Hold rating on December 9. The analyst also lowered the price target from $86 to $82. Kamath anticipates a challenging 2023 for the multiline insurance provider due to weakness in the overall economy.Pzena Investment Management reduced its stake in MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) by 6% during Q3 2022.6. Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO) is a Brentwood, Tennessee-based rural lifestyle retail chain store operator that sells a broad range of products to fulfill the needs of ranchers and recreational farmers.

Furthermore, selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A) observed an increase of 9% compared to the same period last year.

(NASDAQ:TSLA), PepsiCo, Inc.

367,5b11d5f9-f463-3c99-8b30-22fb67e15f78,SRE,2022-12-15,Sempra's (NYSE:SRE) Stock On An Uptrend: Could Fundamentals Be Driving The Momentum?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sempras-nyse-sre-stock-uptrend-140436295.html,1671026676,STORY,['SRE'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Sempra's (NYSE:SRE) stock increased significantly by 5.8% over the past month. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. Specifically, we decided to study Sempra's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Sempra How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Sempra is:8.8% = US$2.6b ÷ US$29b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.09.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Sempra's Earnings Growth And 8.8% ROEOn the face of it, Sempra's ROE is not much to talk about. However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 9.0%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. Looking at Sempra's exceptional 23% five-year net income growth in particular, we are definitely impressed. Given the slightly low ROE, it is likely that there could be some other aspects that are driving this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Sempra's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 2.0% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Sempra's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Sempra Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 64% (implying that it keeps only 36% of profits) for Sempra suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of the earnings to its shareholders.Besides, Sempra has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 55% of its profits over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for Sempra is predicted to rise to 11% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we do feel that Sempra has some positive attributes. That is, quite an impressive growth in earnings. However, the low profit retention means that the company's earnings growth could have been higher, had it been reinvesting a higher portion of its profits. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

As part of this redesign, the substation’s almost 50-year-old switchgear, will be upgraded and expanded during operation.To support TransnetBW’s priorities to ramp up capacity, GE’s Grid Solutions team will design, produce, supply and commission 26 bays of 380 kV air-insulated switchgear (AIS) with associated buildings and control cabinets.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $5.19 a share 30 days away from its upcoming earnings release on January 13, 2023.UnitedHealth Group's Earnings ESP sits at 0.28%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $5.19 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.17.UNH is one of just a large database of Medical stocks with positive ESPs.

(NASDAQ:ADP) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/81-institutional-ownership-automatic-data-130016688.html,1671109216,STORY,['ADP'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 81% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Automatic Data Processing. See our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Automatic Data Processing?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Automatic Data Processing. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Automatic Data Processing's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Automatic Data Processing is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.5% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.2% and 4.3% of the stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Automatic Data ProcessingThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Automatic Data Processing, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$130m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 19% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Automatic Data Processing. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Automatic Data Processing better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Automatic Data Processing   you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

If you want to read about some more stocks that members of Congress own, go directly to 5 Stocks That Members of Congress Own.It is no secret that stock trading has generally been considered a side-benefit to winning a seat in the United States Congress. Although these trades by lawmakers were not available to the public for scrutiny before, they have been since 2012, as the STOCK Act of 2012 mandates that lawmakers disclose these trades publicly. An analysis of these trades by the New York Times has found that at least 97 current members of Congress bought or sold stock, bonds or other financial assets that intersected with their congressional work. It is important to clarify that US lawmakers are not banned from investing in any company, including those companies that could be affected by their decisions. However, such calls have grown in the past few years as the trading activities of lawmakers become controversial. Public outrage over congressional stock trading intensified in recent years after revelations that four senators had sold stocks in 2020 after private briefings on the risks of a coronavirus outbreak in the United States. Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in September 2022 that she would support a floor vote on legislation that would ban members of Congress and their family members from dealing in individual stocks while those lawmakers are in office. Pelosi had earlier gone against such a vote. Some of the top stocks that US Congress members presently own include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), among others. The US Congress has postponed a vote regarding the ban on stock trading for lawmakers until after the midterm elections. Photo by MIKE STOLL on UnsplashOur MethodologyThe companies listed below were picked from the Periodic Transaction Report(s) that US politicians who trade stocks are obliged to file. It is important to clarify that the stocks listed below were picked from the public record of investments Congress members and their families have made in the past few months.

It would be easy to say that it is because as the world reopens, people are traveling for the first time in two years, providing a short-term benefit to the company.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Stocks Most Affected by Inflation.Inflation in the US is hovering around a four-decade high, and this has caused experts to investigate its impact on different corporations. The first takeaway is that companies that are cyclical in nature and can pass on price increases to customers can safeguard their margins during periods of raging inflation. As a result, they experience growth and expansion during inflationary periods. On the other hand, companies that are carrying high levels of debt and are sensitive to interest rate changes come under pressure. This is because, during periods of high inflation, it is a common practice to increase benchmark interest rates to bring inflation under control, which leads to highly leveraged entities incurring increased financing costs. According to the financial services firm Allianz, sectors like consumer staples and utilities have had an inverse correlation with inflation rates as these businesses utilize resources that raise the cost of their inputs. In general, this has had a negative impact on their stock prices and margins. In contrast, businesses in the materials and energy industries traditionally have had a positive correlation with inflation. Inflation also causes challenges for technology companies undergoing the growth phase. However, the decline for technology companies has been much softer as compared to the dot com bubble burst in the early 2000s.Inflation was a key topic during the Q3 2022 earnings season as well as it was discussed by the majority of the companies during their conference calls. Depending on the nature of the businesses, companies were impacted differently by inflation. Numerous leading companies were able to surpass consensus top-line and bottom-line expectations for Q3 2022 as they were able to pass the price increases on to the customers and control their cost structure, despite experiencing a decline in unit sales. In contrast, companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) observed rising raw material costs, resulting in a contraction in margins. As of November, inflation grew by 7.7% YoY in the US as opposed to the Federal Reserve’s long-term target of 2% only.Story continues10 Stocks Most Affected by InflationOur MethodologyWe have analyzed the earnings reports, analyst ratings, and growth prospects of the companies to shortlist the 10 stocks most affected by inflation. While some of these companies have strong fundamentals, the raging inflation has had a strong negative impact on their operations and financial strength. We have ranked these stocks in terms of the level of hedge fund ownership as of Q3 2022.10 Stocks Most Affected by Inflation10. Beyond Meat, Inc.

(NASDAQ:BYND) is a Los Angeles, California-based producer of plant-based meat alternatives for the vegan community.The company, founded in 2009, has come under intense pressure due to declining demand for its products.

On December 9, Kristina Ruggeri at Argus downgraded Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) stock from a Hold to a Sell rating as the analyst observed a diminishing demand due to high inflation. The analyst also observed that the rise in prices is causing customers to trade down to more economical choices. Ms. Ruggeri added that Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) has also been adversely impacted by an increase in competition as other players have emerged in the plant-based meat substitute industry.Here's what Horos Asset Management said about Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“What about the other asset class that has attracted the most attention from the investment community in recent times? Beyond Meat is the other company whose valuations we did not understand and whose share price has also declined drastically in the last year and a half.”9.

This caused the company to miss the top-line and bottom-line estimates for the quarter.

The revised target price represents a potential downside of over 17% from the closing price of December 13. The analyst observed that the company data reflects that there has been a significant decline in the sale of appliances.8. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) is an operator of cryptocurrency exchanges that have been severely impacted by rising inflation.The price of the two notable cryptocurrencies in the form of Bitcoin and Ethereum have lost nearly 60% of their value YTD. The sharp decline has led investors to bear heavy losses and liquidate their positions in the cryptocurrency universe. The sentiments of cryptocurrency investors are expected to remain depressed next year and in 2024 as well.Based on these developments, Dan Dolev at Mizuho downgraded Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) stock from a Neutral to an Underperform rating on December 9. The analyst also reduced the target price by more than 28% from $42 to $30. The reduced target price is 25% lower than the last closing price of December 13. The significant downward revision in target price has been due to Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) slashing the revenue and EBITDA forecast for 2024 by 18% and 64%, respectively.Here's what Hayden Capital said about Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN): The crypto ecosystem moves extremely quickly, and there’s been many new developments since we first invested in Coinbase, a year ago. Most notably, crypto market cap has declined from a peak of ~$3 Trillion last fall, to ~$1.1 Trillion today (a -63% decline, and -72% peak-to-trough; LINK). Crypto is a volatile asset class, and has experienced many draw-downs of similar magnitude in the past. For example, Bitcoin was down -93% during 2011, -85% from 2013-15, and -84% from 2017-18. In this context, the latest draw-down is a pretty normal outcome for this emerging asset class.A large reason for this volatility, is simply because there aren’t any major “real-world use cases” for the asset just yet. In our letter outlining the investment last year, we wrote that crypto is still “in the middle of ‘crossing the chasm’ into mainstream adoption &amp; use cases, which will result in millions of mainstream users needing to transact crypto in some form”…” (Click here to see the full text)7.

Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)8.

In August, spending on dental services was estimated to stand at $113.4 billion, representing a 6.4% increase from 12 months prior. With spending on dental care rising and recovering, dentists today are more confident in a full-fledged recovery in the dental sector since its previous lows.While more renowned companies like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) have been playing a role in the dental care sector with their provision of oral care products such as toothpaste, toothbrushes, and more, other companies offering dental implants and clear aligners have been in the spotlight just as much. The main players in the dental products and implants sector today include names like Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSIC), Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN), and Straumann (SWX:STMN). Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSIC) accounts for about 28.6% of the market share in the dental equipment industry, while Align Technology, Inc.

Straumann (SWX:STMN) also constitutes about 24% of the global dentistry market share.One new and profitable segment within the broader dental care industry is that of dental implants. According to a report by Grand View Research, the dental implant market size is expected to reach $9.62 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of 9.8%.

As a result, some dividend stocks are worth buying for investors. But as with any category of equities, there are also bad dividend stocks that investors should sell  This column, as indicated by the headline,  features a list of seven dividend stocks to sell.Companies that issue dividends are generally mature firms that are not expected to deliver above-average growth.  However, although these stocks lack sizzle, they offer stability. That makes them an appealing choice for investors who are primarily looking to preserve their wealth.But as 2022 is showing us, the best investments need to provide total returns that outpace inflation. This means that investors  should be getting some growth to go along with their dividends. And there are some dividend stocks that do not look poised to meet that standard.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo for this article, we’re looking at seven dividend stocks to sell before they dive in 2023.MOAltria Group$46.71CLXClorox$148.78GPSGap$13.90MACMacerich$12.46HBIHanebrands$6.35ZIMZim Integrated$18.57SMGScotts Miracle-Gro$51.73Altria Group (MO)Source: ©iStock.com/NickyBladeI can’t deny that Alex Sirois, another InvestorPlace columnist, recently gave investors a straightforward reason to buy Altria Group (NYSE:MO). Specifically, he pointed out that its dividend yield is currently over 8%. I can also buy the argument that MO stock is cheap and that the “sin stock” is valued correctly at its current level.But  I’m going to consider the debt levels of many of the companies on this list. And I can’t be bullish on  Altria because of its high debt levels. The company has a negative debt-equity ratio, which means its liabilities exceed its assets. Further, its growth looks poised to slow.As a result, I believe that,  if servicing Altria’s debt isn’t problematic for the company today, it will probably become very difficult for the firm down the road. It may choose to alleviate that problem by cutting its dividendStory continuesSure, investors can buy MO stock and sell the shares if and when the company lowers its payout. Or they can sell it now and look for stocks that will reward them with higher total returns.Clorox (CLX)Clorox bleach bottles lined up on a store shelf.Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comClorox (NYSE:CLX) is a staple of many buy-and-hold portfolios. The company is about as much of a defensive stock as value investors could hope for. CLX proved itself during the pandemic, and in 2022, its top line has continued to hold up well.Clorox’s earnings, however, are a bit of a concern, and the reason for that is inflation. The company is attempting to pass along its higher costs, but it has not been able to do so, as its  margins are below the average of its sector.However, those problems are not  reflected in CLX stock, which traded at a price–earnings (P/E) ratio of over 44 times in November and now has a P/E ratio of over 46 times, versus the sector’ average of around 27 times.All of that may not matter to long-term investors who are enamored by the company’s dividend which has a yield of over 3% and has been growing for 35 years.  But, on the other hand, the growth of CLX’s dividend has been slowing. And with Clorox’s payout ratio  over 144%, there’s reason for investors to look at other options.Gap (GPS)GPS stock: a close up of a Gap logo on a buildingSource: ShutterstockWith a quick glance, you can see the appeal of Gap (NYSE:GPS) stock. The shares are up 77% since the end of September, and they still trade for less than $15 per share. Moreover,  the retailer’s second-quarter and third-quarter results both beat analysts’ average estimates.That said, most analysts remain less than impressed with GPS. Their average stock price on the shares are somewhere around $11. That’s probably due to the company’s own projections for a “just ok” holiday season. Add in the high likelihood of a recession occurring sometime in 2023, and there are reasons to be concerned about Gap.Like Josh Enomoto, another InvestorPlace columnist,  I believe that there’s a great deal of competition in the premium apparel space. Additionally other names, like Target (NYSE:TGT), that are in similar markets as Gap, have  a far more attractive dividend. So at a time when you have to buy the best and sell the rest, GPS stock belongs on this list of dividend stocks to sell.Macerich (MAC)A photo of someone looking at clothing on hangers, hanging from a rack.Source: Rawpixel.com/ShutterStock.comThe first weekend of holiday shopping was surprisingly solid for brick-and-mortar retailers. It seems like after two years of anti-coronavirus measures, many consumers were willing to put up with holiday crowds. That should be good news for Macerich (NYSE:MAC) which is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that focuses on high-end mall properties.But the saying, All that glitters is not gold” may apply to MAC stock. That’s because the company’s fundamentals are a mess, as it has a high debt-to-equity ratio, while its profit margin and return on assets are both below the sector averages.Plus, the company’s properties are generally located in some of the nation’s most densely populated areas. However, several of those cities, such as Chicago, are currently dealing with rising crime rates that are likely to keep retail traffic down.REITs are generally attractive to investors because they are required to pay out a significant portion of their profits in the form of a dividend. But Macerich’s earnings have been plummeting, and that means that its dividends will be falling as well.Zim Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM)A large ULCV container ship underway, sails on open water fully loaded with containers and cargo - the ZIM San FranciscoSource: ImagineStock / Shutterstock.comI can understand the desire to buy a shipping stock like Zim Integrated Shipping Services (NYSE:ZIM).  After all, the stock offers an attractive dividend, and investors  can hold onto the stock and wait for the company’s growth to rebound, which will definitely occur when China fully reopens.But since it’s the holiday season, I’ll assert that the expression, “if ifs and buts were candy and nuts,” applies to ZIM stock. The reality is that investors have been waiting a calendar year for the slowdown of container shipping to reverse. They’re still waiting. China is beginning to loosen the most draconian of its restrictions, but the Chinese economy is far from firing on all cylinders.And even if China recovers, concerns about global demand are rising. All in all, ZIM is facing a great deal of uncertainty. And since investors hate uncertainty, it’s probably a good time to stay away from ZIM stock.Hanesbrands (HBI)HanesBrands (HBI) logo on a storefront during daylightSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comHanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) stock is down 62% for the year. By itself, that’s not a reason to sell a stock if the company looks well-positioned to grow. That’s not the case, however, for Hanesbrands, which has multiple concerns that make owning its stock risky.Based on Hanesbrands’ headline numbers, the company’s third-quarter earnings report was decent, as it narrowly beat analysts’ average estimate on the bottom line and only slightly missed their mean top-line estimate.But both numbers declined year-over-year – and this isn’t the first quarter that this has happened to HBI. It appears that the firm’s overstocked inventories are eating into its free cash flow and exacerbating its debt problem.Debt is a real problem for HBI as the company has a debt–equity ratio of 5.4. As I cautioned in November, if the company chooses to refinance its debt, it will pay a  relatively high interest rate. Alternatively, HBI could  cut its dividend. Both options are unappealing for investorsScotts Miracle-Gro Company (SMG)Scotts Miracle-Gro logo displayed on a web browser and magnified by a magnifying glassSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comLast on this list of dividend stocks to sell is Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG). Like many home-and-garden companies, the company was a big winner during the pandemic. However, those days are long gone and so are the gains by SMG stock.When the company reported its earnings in August, it lowered its full-year revenue forecast and predicted that its top line would fall 8%-9% in 2022. And in November, the company’s results showed that forecast coming to fruition. However, SMG stock popped after the dismal report, possibly on expectations that the shares had bottomed.There may have also been hope that the company’s cannabis business, Hawthorne Gardening, would improve going forward. The business’ sales have fallen sharply as it deals with similar oversupply issues as those affecting many cannabis companies.There may be some deep value in Scotts Miracle-Gro as InvestorPlace columnist Will Ashworth suggested in September. And the company’s dividend, which currently yields over 5%, may seem attractive. But right now the company’s shares don’t look poised to appreciate.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines. Chris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over five years.

If you want to read about some more high potential stocks, go directly to 5 Stocks Under $5 With High Potential.The US stock market is the biggest equity trading market in the world. The biggest and most valuable companies trade on exchanges in the US. However, given the bias towards growth in the past few years, the stocks of these big firms, like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), have become out of reach for the common investors. For those not willing to break the bank for investments in stocks, there are many cheaper options available that offer high potential. Smart traders know that there are deals to be had when markets swoon and stock prices drop across the board. But picking the right stock to buy is tough because of multiple reasons. Buying the dip is not as simple a trading strategy as it might seem and should be cautiously approached. Some of the potential indicators to look for when investing in small firms are growth in revenues and earnings per share, as well as projected figures for these across the next five years. In addition, the price-to-earnings ratios should also be monitored. Stocks that are trading at a discount to all-time highs generally offer room for growth. In addition, as the markets recover from the macro slowdown, analysts are expecting average annual EPS growth of more than 20% over the next five years, a clear indicator that it might be a very good time to invest in the stock market, especially in cheaper firms that offer explosive growth potential. There is reason for investors to be cautious when trading in cheap stocks too, as recent research suggests that these trades are loaded with risk. Generally, stocks priced under $5 per share are known as penny stocks. Trades in penny stocks have increased as more retail investors enter the market. This increase is surprising since historical data shows that these trades rarely make money. Calculations by Sihan Zhang, a doctoral student at the University of Alberta, reveal that between July 2011 and October 2020, the average annualized return of Over the Counter (OTC) shares in the US, mostly penny firms, was 44% in the red. Story continuesAnother important factor to consider when trading in penny stocks is that many of them lie outside the US. Of the 11,500 firms listed on the OTC, nearly three quarters are based outside the US. The influence of retail investors in penny trades can also be understood when viewed in context of a Morgan Stanley report from last June that outlined that these traders accounted for nearly 10% of the daily trading volume on the Russell 3000, the broadest stock index in the US. This number has gone up since last year. However, there are also many positives to consider when trading in penny stocks. Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a global markets strategist at JPMorgan, has highlighted how a list of stocks popular with retail traders in the US outperformed the benchmark S&amp;P 500 this year. The analysis highlights a market shift towards growth companies that trade on the cheap. As the market recovers from a slow year, the volume of penny stock trades has started picking up as well. Our MethodologyThe companies that have upcoming growth catalysts and were priced under $5 per share, as of December 14, were selected for the list.

If you want to read about some more aluminum companies, go directly to 5 Biggest Aluminum Companies In The World.Aluminum is one of the most abundant metallic elements in the Earth’s crust. It possesses many properties, being durable, malleable, strong, lightweight, flexible, and resistant to corrosion and oxidation. It also has high reflectivity and excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. It is widely used in the manufacturing of many important automobile parts, like wheels, engines, chassis, and other parts of modern cars. Globally, it is also used to produce smartphones, tablets, personal computers (PCs), refrigerators, and other electronic items.The market growth in the aluminum sector can be attributed to the extensive use of the metal in different industries across the globe. For instance, in addition to being important for electronics and cars, it is employed in the food and beverage industry for making packaging containers, in the cosmetics industry for packing and protecting cosmetic products, in the production of different dosage forms of medications, including capsules, creams, lotions, liquid, and powders, and other pharma products. The aluminum market, like other sectors of the economy, was severely affected by the COVID-19 crisis. However, since then, demand for cars and electronics have skyrocketed. The aluminum industry has not taken full advantage of this rise in demand since the onset of inflation following the market recovery has resulted in a shortage of workers in the manufacturing sectors, in tandem with a fall in demand from the aerospace and automotive industries. The rising consumption of packaged foods is offsetting this to some extent. Despite the near-term headwinds, it is expected that the aluminum market will rise in the coming years. Conservative estimates of the aluminum market size before the end of this decade place it around $277 billion, predicting a compound annual growth rate of more than 5.6%. Some of the top firms working in the aluminum sector include Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

The current price of aluminum is unsustainably low, below its cost of production, despite inventories being at historic lows. We believe these depressed prices are due to the evaporation of Chinese demand resulting from its zero COVID-19 policy, but that it will likely recover over the next few quarters.Additionally, Alcoa is leading the industry in reducing carbon emissions from its smelting process which is helping to improve its cost position relative to global competitors.

The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $4 billion.Third Point mentioned Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its recently-published Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)8.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Commission (EC) has expanded the marketing authorization for Dupixent® (dupilumab) in the European Union to treat adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis who are candidates for systemic therapy. Prurigo nodularis is a chronic, debilitating skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and its impact on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases. With this approval, Dupixent is the first and only targeted medicine specifically indicated to treat prurigo nodularis in Europe and the U.S.""For the first time, patients with prurigo nodularis in Europe have a medicine that can help relieve the burden of itchy and painful nodules covering their skin, which can have a devastating impact on their day-to-day lives, both physically and mentally,"" said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron, and a principal inventor of Dupixent. ""Dupixent is now approved for its second dermatological disease and fourth disease overall. We remain committed to further investigating this innovative medicine for diseases – such as chronic urticarias and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – in which type 2 inflammation may play a role.""""As the first and only targeted medicine approved to treat people living with prurigo nodularis, Dupixent has the potential to transform the standard-of-care for people in Europe living with this debilitating skin disease. In the pivotal trials, patients treated with Dupixent experienced significant improvements in key hallmarks of the disease, such as reduction in itch and achieving clearer skin, as well as broader impacts on their daily lives,"" Naimish Patel, M.D. Head of Global Development, Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ""This approval of Dupixent underscores our continued commitment to bringing Dupixent to patients suffering from chronic skin diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation as quickly as possible.""Story continuesThe EC decision is based on data from two Phase 3 trials, PRIME and PRIME2, evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent (PRIME n=75; PRIME2 n=78) in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis compared to placebo (PRIME n=76; PRIME2 n=82). In these trials, 44% and 37% of Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch at 12 weeks, compared to 16% and 22% for placebo, respectively. The improvement further increased at 24 weeks, with approximately three times as many Dupixent patients (60% and 58%) experiencing a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline, compared to placebo (18% and 20%).In PRIME and PRIME2, more than twice as many Dupixent patients (48% and 45%) also achieved clear or almost clear skin at 24 weeks, compared to placebo (18% and 16%). Dupixent also significantly improved health-related quality of life, while reducing measures of skin pain and symptoms of anxiety/depression from baseline at 24 weeks compared to placebo.The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications, with the most common side effects across indications including injection site reactions, conjunctivitis, conjunctivitis allergic, arthralgia, oral herpes and eosinophilia. Adverse events more commonly observed in prurigo nodularis with Dupixent compared to placebo included conjunctivitis (4% Dupixent and 1% placebo).About Prurigo NodularisPrurigo nodularis is a chronic, debilitating skin disease with underlying type 2 inflammation and has one of the highest impacts on a patient's quality of life among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch it causes. Those with prurigo nodularis experience intense, persistent itch with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. The disease is often painful – with burning, stinging and tingling of the skin – and can negatively affect mental health, activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long-term. In Europe, about 70,000 adults living with prurigo nodularis are most in need of new treatment options.About the Dupixent Prurigo Nodularis TrialsThe PRIME and PRIME2 Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 311 adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis. In PRIME and PRIME2, the primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch from baseline (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] on a 0-10 scale) at 24 and 12 weeks, respectively.Additional endpoints included the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin of nodules at 24 weeks (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] on a 0-4 scale), the proportion of patients who achieved a clinically meaningful response in both WI-NRS and IGA PN-S, improvement from baseline in health-related quality of life (measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI] on a 0-30 scale), improvement from baseline in skin pain (measured by a Numerical Rating Scale from 0-10), and improvement from baseline in symptoms of anxiety and depression (measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS] from 0-42).About DupixentDupixent is an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In the EU for adults with prurigo nodularis, Dupixent is administered at 300 mg every two weeks, following a loading dose. It is available as both a pre-filled pen and pre-filled syringe at the 300 mg dose. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional.Dupixent, which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and prurigo nodularis, as well as investigational disease eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in the EU.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in Europe, the U.S. and Japan. More than 500,000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent, Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including pediatric EoE, hand and foot atopic dermatitis, chronic inducible urticaria-cold, chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic pruritus of unknown origin, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company to watch right now is Affiliated Managers Group (AMG). AMG is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 7.92, while its industry has an average P/E of 13.28. Over the past 52 weeks, AMG's Forward P/E has been as high as 195.25 and as low as 5.85, with a median of 6.81.We should also highlight that AMG has a P/B ratio of 1.62. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 2.68. Over the past 12 months, AMG's P/B has been as high as 2.16 and as low as 1.17, with a median of 1.43.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. AMG has a P/S ratio of 2.39. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.43.Finally, investors should note that AMG has a P/CF ratio of 11.03. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 25.02. Over the past year, AMG's P/CF has been as high as 13.45 and as low as 7.95, with a median of 9.81.Story continuesAnother great Financial - Investment Management stock you could consider is Ameriprise Financial (AMP), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.Ameriprise Financial is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 11.30 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 0.65. This compares to its industry's average P/E of 13.28 and average PEG ratio of 0.84.Over the last 12 months, AMP's P/E has been as high as 57.02, as low as 7.92, with a median of 10.53, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 0.77, as low as 0.58, with a median of 0.66.Ameriprise Financial sports a P/B ratio of 10.65 as well; this compares to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 2.68. In the past 52 weeks, AMP's P/B has been as high as 10.87, as low as 5.14, with a median of 6.18.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Affiliated Managers Group and Ameriprise Financial strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now.

As a result, some dividend stocks are worth buying for investors. But as with any category of equities, there are also bad dividend stocks that investors should sell  This column, as indicated by the headline,  features a list of seven dividend stocks to sell.Companies that issue dividends are generally mature firms that are not expected to deliver above-average growth.  However, although these stocks lack sizzle, they offer stability. That makes them an appealing choice for investors who are primarily looking to preserve their wealth.But as 2022 is showing us, the best investments need to provide total returns that outpace inflation. This means that investors  should be getting some growth to go along with their dividends. And there are some dividend stocks that do not look poised to meet that standard.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo for this article, we’re looking at seven dividend stocks to sell before they dive in 2023.MOAltria Group$46.71CLXClorox$148.78GPSGap$13.90MACMacerich$12.46HBIHanebrands$6.35ZIMZim Integrated$18.57SMGScotts Miracle-Gro$51.73Altria Group (MO)Source: ©iStock.com/NickyBladeI can’t deny that Alex Sirois, another InvestorPlace columnist, recently gave investors a straightforward reason to buy Altria Group (NYSE:MO). Specifically, he pointed out that its dividend yield is currently over 8%. I can also buy the argument that MO stock is cheap and that the “sin stock” is valued correctly at its current level.But  I’m going to consider the debt levels of many of the companies on this list. And I can’t be bullish on  Altria because of its high debt levels. The company has a negative debt-equity ratio, which means its liabilities exceed its assets. Further, its growth looks poised to slow.As a result, I believe that,  if servicing Altria’s debt isn’t problematic for the company today, it will probably become very difficult for the firm down the road. It may choose to alleviate that problem by cutting its dividendStory continuesSure, investors can buy MO stock and sell the shares if and when the company lowers its payout. Or they can sell it now and look for stocks that will reward them with higher total returns.Clorox (CLX)Clorox bleach bottles lined up on a store shelf.Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comClorox (NYSE:CLX) is a staple of many buy-and-hold portfolios. The company is about as much of a defensive stock as value investors could hope for. CLX proved itself during the pandemic, and in 2022, its top line has continued to hold up well.Clorox’s earnings, however, are a bit of a concern, and the reason for that is inflation. The company is attempting to pass along its higher costs, but it has not been able to do so, as its  margins are below the average of its sector.However, those problems are not  reflected in CLX stock, which traded at a price–earnings (P/E) ratio of over 44 times in November and now has a P/E ratio of over 46 times, versus the sector’ average of around 27 times.All of that may not matter to long-term investors who are enamored by the company’s dividend which has a yield of over 3% and has been growing for 35 years.  But, on the other hand, the growth of CLX’s dividend has been slowing. And with Clorox’s payout ratio  over 144%, there’s reason for investors to look at other options.Gap (GPS)GPS stock: a close up of a Gap logo on a buildingSource: ShutterstockWith a quick glance, you can see the appeal of Gap (NYSE:GPS) stock. The shares are up 77% since the end of September, and they still trade for less than $15 per share. Moreover,  the retailer’s second-quarter and third-quarter results both beat analysts’ average estimates.That said, most analysts remain less than impressed with GPS. Their average stock price on the shares are somewhere around $11. That’s probably due to the company’s own projections for a “just ok” holiday season. Add in the high likelihood of a recession occurring sometime in 2023, and there are reasons to be concerned about Gap.Like Josh Enomoto, another InvestorPlace columnist,  I believe that there’s a great deal of competition in the premium apparel space. Additionally other names, like Target (NYSE:TGT), that are in similar markets as Gap, have  a far more attractive dividend. So at a time when you have to buy the best and sell the rest, GPS stock belongs on this list of dividend stocks to sell.Macerich (MAC)A photo of someone looking at clothing on hangers, hanging from a rack.Source: Rawpixel.com/ShutterStock.comThe first weekend of holiday shopping was surprisingly solid for brick-and-mortar retailers. It seems like after two years of anti-coronavirus measures, many consumers were willing to put up with holiday crowds. That should be good news for Macerich (NYSE:MAC) which is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that focuses on high-end mall properties.But the saying, All that glitters is not gold” may apply to MAC stock. That’s because the company’s fundamentals are a mess, as it has a high debt-to-equity ratio, while its profit margin and return on assets are both below the sector averages.Plus, the company’s properties are generally located in some of the nation’s most densely populated areas. However, several of those cities, such as Chicago, are currently dealing with rising crime rates that are likely to keep retail traffic down.REITs are generally attractive to investors because they are required to pay out a significant portion of their profits in the form of a dividend. But Macerich’s earnings have been plummeting, and that means that its dividends will be falling as well.Zim Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM)A large ULCV container ship underway, sails on open water fully loaded with containers and cargo - the ZIM San FranciscoSource: ImagineStock / Shutterstock.comI can understand the desire to buy a shipping stock like Zim Integrated Shipping Services (NYSE:ZIM).  After all, the stock offers an attractive dividend, and investors  can hold onto the stock and wait for the company’s growth to rebound, which will definitely occur when China fully reopens.But since it’s the holiday season, I’ll assert that the expression, “if ifs and buts were candy and nuts,” applies to ZIM stock. The reality is that investors have been waiting a calendar year for the slowdown of container shipping to reverse. They’re still waiting. China is beginning to loosen the most draconian of its restrictions, but the Chinese economy is far from firing on all cylinders.And even if China recovers, concerns about global demand are rising. All in all, ZIM is facing a great deal of uncertainty. And since investors hate uncertainty, it’s probably a good time to stay away from ZIM stock.Hanesbrands (HBI)HanesBrands (HBI) logo on a storefront during daylightSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comHanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) stock is down 62% for the year. By itself, that’s not a reason to sell a stock if the company looks well-positioned to grow. That’s not the case, however, for Hanesbrands, which has multiple concerns that make owning its stock risky.Based on Hanesbrands’ headline numbers, the company’s third-quarter earnings report was decent, as it narrowly beat analysts’ average estimate on the bottom line and only slightly missed their mean top-line estimate.But both numbers declined year-over-year – and this isn’t the first quarter that this has happened to HBI. It appears that the firm’s overstocked inventories are eating into its free cash flow and exacerbating its debt problem.Debt is a real problem for HBI as the company has a debt–equity ratio of 5.4. As I cautioned in November, if the company chooses to refinance its debt, it will pay a  relatively high interest rate. Alternatively, HBI could  cut its dividend. Both options are unappealing for investorsScotts Miracle-Gro Company (SMG)Scotts Miracle-Gro logo displayed on a web browser and magnified by a magnifying glassSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comLast on this list of dividend stocks to sell is Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG). Like many home-and-garden companies, the company was a big winner during the pandemic. However, those days are long gone and so are the gains by SMG stock.When the company reported its earnings in August, it lowered its full-year revenue forecast and predicted that its top line would fall 8%-9% in 2022. And in November, the company’s results showed that forecast coming to fruition. However, SMG stock popped after the dismal report, possibly on expectations that the shares had bottomed.There may have also been hope that the company’s cannabis business, Hawthorne Gardening, would improve going forward. The business’ sales have fallen sharply as it deals with similar oversupply issues as those affecting many cannabis companies.There may be some deep value in Scotts Miracle-Gro as InvestorPlace columnist Will Ashworth suggested in September. And the company’s dividend, which currently yields over 5%, may seem attractive. But right now the company’s shares don’t look poised to appreciate.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines. Chris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over five years.

(CSCO) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-csco-attracting-140002818.html,1671026402,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (CSCO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned +10.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.9% change. The Zacks Computer - Networking industry, to which Cisco belongs, has gained 10.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Cisco is expected to post earnings of $0.86 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.54 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.4%. This estimate has changed +2.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.80 indicates a change of +7.3% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Cisco.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CSCO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Cisco, the consensus sales estimate of $13.42 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.5%. The $54.44 billion and $56.3 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5.6% and +3.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCisco reported revenues of $13.63 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.7%. EPS of $0.86 for the same period compares with $0.82 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.32 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.32%. The EPS surprise was +2.38%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cisco is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cisco. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
