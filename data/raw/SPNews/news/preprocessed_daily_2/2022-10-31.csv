4,84eb7b90-d193-37ee-9774-c087455f3f4b,SCHW,2022-10-31,Is Schwab Fundamental U.S. Broad Market Index ETF (FNDB) a Strong ETF Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-fundamental-u-broad-market-102010423.html,1667211610,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Designed to provide broad exposure to the Style Box - All Cap Value category of the market, the Schwab Fundamental U.S. Broad Market Index ETF (FNDB) is a smart beta exchange traded fund launched on 08/13/2013.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.A good option for investors who believe in market efficiency, market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns.If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexFNDB is managed by Charles Schwab, and this fund has amassed over $454.68 million, which makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Style Box - All Cap Value. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Index.The Russell RAFI US Index measures the performance of the constituent companies by fundamental overall company scores.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Story continuesOperating expenses on an annual basis are 0.25% for FNDB, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.FNDB's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.98%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.FNDB's heaviest allocation is in the Information Technology sector, which is about 15.20% of the portfolio. Its Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 4.07% of total assets, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 18.09% of FNDB's total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has lost about -8.25% so far this year and is down about -4.43% in the last one year (as of 10/31/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $47.13 and $59.23.FNDB has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 24.89% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium risk choice in the space. With about 1709 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Broad Market Index ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - All Cap Value segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.Dimensional U.S. Targeted Value ETF (DFAT) tracks ---------------------------------------- and the iShares Core S&amp;P U.S. Value ETF (IUSV) tracks S&amp;P 900 Value Index. Dimensional U.S. Targeted Value ETF has $7.17 billion in assets, iShares Core S&amp;P U.S. Value ETF has $12.17 billion. DFAT has an expense ratio of 0.29% and IUSV charges 0.04%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - All Cap Value.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to explore similar companies, you can also take a look at Top 5 Life Insurance Companies In The World.Life Insurance Industry: An AnalysisThe life insurance industry is a vital part of the financial services sector in the United States. It helps provide financial security for families in the event of the death of a breadwinner, and also offers a variety of other products and services to meet the needs of policyholders. The industry is highly competitive, with a large number of companies offering a variety of products. Life insurance companies must be licensed in every state in which they do business, and are subject to regulation by the state insurance commissioner. The life insurance industry has undergone a number of changes in recent years, including the introduction of new products, the consolidation of companies, and the emergence of new distribution channels.According to statistics from McKinsey, life insurance made up 45% of global premiums in 2019, up 4.4% from its share in 2018. Global life insurance gross premiums went up by 4% in 2019, in line with the growth rate in 2017 and 2018. Developing economies in the Asia Pacific region exhibited the fastest growth in the world, and grew by 10% in 2019. The pandemic drove the life insurance premiums growth in 2020 and 2021, however, growth attributed to the pandemic appears to be slowing down according to the 2023 insurance outlook by Deloitte. Deloitte analysts expect a minor contraction in global premiums growth in 2022, 0.2%, partly due to rising interest rates and surging inflation. However, Deloitte forecasts that global premiums growth will rebound in 2023 and record a 1.9% increase in the year across emerging markets as the inflation situation cools down and economic conditions improve. Deloitte expects life insurance premiums to fall across North America, Europe, and China in 2022. However, the firm sees emerging markets, excluding China, registering a positive growth print of 3.5% for premiums in 2022, led by India recording a 6% increase in life insurance premiums for the year.

FREE cash flow generation has continued to improve, allowing the company to pay out $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchase $426 million shares since fiscal year 2019. Having paid down $5 billion in debt during the same period, Microchip’s credit rating was upgraded to investment grade in 2021, reflecting its higher-quality balance sheet. While we recognize Microchip operates in a cyclical industry, we admire the company’s history of strong FREE cash flow generation through the cycles. Moreover, our conviction remains in Microchip’s ability to grow its market share while uniquely benefiting from the secular trend of expanded usage of MCUs across segments that include 5G products, Internet of Things (IoT), data centers, electric vehicles and autonomous driving systems.”10.

We believe the company is well positioned to benefit from several profit cycle drivers. First, a broad shift from reusable contact lenses to soft, daily disposable lenses is underway. The convenience of less upkeep and increased comfort makes daily lenses an attractive option with higher recurring revenues to Cooper. We are also drawn to the company’s MiSight soft contact lens product, which is used to treat myopia (nearsightedness). Myopia is a global health issue—associated with increased screen time and indoor activity—affecting ~30% of the population and is expected to reach 50% over the coming decades (with particularly high prevalence among children). MiSight is the first and only FDA-approved myopia control contact lens, and we believe it could open a multi-billion-dollar market and be a meaningful growth driver in the years ahead.

CSL’s core business continues to enjoy significant competitive advantages, in our view, and, as collected plasma is processed into finished products, we believe sales will return to their pre-COVID-19 levels. It will take time for this to play out, but it is a welcome improvement. Most of the other segments of the business are performing well, and steady demand for CSL’s products, which are less economically sensitive, has likely contributed to the stability of shares recently.”8.

While slowing global growth could weigh on package volumes in the near term, UPS has been adept at cutting costs and paying down its debt, resulting in a more efficient company with a stronger balance sheet that will be able to weather any kind of recessionary storm.Hedge fund ownership of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) sank during Q2, as there was a 24% drop in the number of smart money managers long the stock.

Revenues increased 15% in the year, with strong leverage in the business boosting operating profit by al- most 67%. Management is focusing on a ‘Better not Bigger’ strategy for the business and divested the UPS Freight business early in the year. Mean- while, the company is expected to increase distributions to shareholders in 2022, from both dividends and share buybacks.”14.

The company’s dividend history is complicated by its split with AbbVie however, which necessitated a lower subsequent payout. The company is otherwise considered a Dividend King, with a 50-year streak of dividend growth.The medical device manufacturer pays out just 33% of its net income in dividends, and its shares carry a 1.89% yield. While Abbott’s adjusted diluted EPS fell by 17.9% to $1.15 during Q3, analysts believe the company can grow that figure by 11% over the next five years, which could sustain continued double digit growth in the company’s dividend.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has consistently remained among the second tier of most popular stocks among hedge funds, routinely hovering around the top 50.

Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”12. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 69 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12.2% Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has an eight-year run of dividend growth ongoing, which included a 33% hike to its quarterly payments in the second quarter of 2021.

That said, Oracle in June closed its largest-ever deal with the acquisition of Cerner, a designer of software to store and analyze medical records and other healthcare data.Oracle took on additional debt to finance this all-cash acquisition and as a result plans to moderate its stock-buyback program to focus on debt reduction.

Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 70 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12.9% Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) shares have one of the lowest yields among this group of growth stocks at just 1.09%, but there’s nonetheless a lot to like about the future of the pharmaceutical giant’s dividend payments, which have been experiencing accelerating growth over the past few years. LLY grew its dividend by 14.7% in 2020, followed by a 14.8% hike in 2021, and a 15.3% increase this year. The company’s payout ratio is 44%.Eli Lilly boasts a promising pipeline of more than 20 candidates that could fuel future earnings growth and dividend increases.

Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is off to a strong start. In addition, Mounjaro may be approved for obesity next year. In clinical trials, Mounjaro delivered up to 22.5% average weight loss in adults with obesity and has the potential to be a top-selling drug. Lilly also has a drug in development for Alzheimer’s disease in the same class as Lecanemab, a drug being developed by Biogen and Eisai that slowed the rate of cognitive decline in a late-stage clinical trial. Lilly is not facing any significant near-term patent expirations and we think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”10.

ABBV shares yield just over 4%.While AbbVie is set to lose the exclusivity on its blockbuster drug Humira next year, the company already has two growing successors on its heels in the form of Rinvoq and Skyrizi, which grew revenue by 56% and 85% respectively during Q2. AbbVie also has a deep and promising pipeline in facial aesthetics treatments, a market that’s expected to grow at a CAGR of 14% through 2028.The number of funds long AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) has ticked down for the past two quarters, falling by 14% during that period. David Harding’s Winton Capital Management and Anna Nikolayevsky’s Axel Capital Management sold off their ABBV stakes during Q2. Arrowstreet Capital, lead by the team of Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell, held the largest Abbvie stake on June 30 among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database.Baron Funds also discussed AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter, in which it expressed optimism about the company’s drug pipeline:“AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a drug developer best known for Humira, an immunosuppressant that is the best selling drug of all time. Given outsized key product risk (patent cliff and generic launches beginning in 2023), AbbVie has broadened its pipeline, highlighted by its Allergan acquisition. Shares fell on results that missed consensus and indications that legacy franchises were outperforming newer product launches, calling into question AbbVie’s long-term strategy. With promising assets in the pipeline and its robust cash flow profile, we believe AbbVie will grow well into the future.”9. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 72 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 11.1% NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has a 32-year streak of paying dividends and a nine-year run of dividend growth. Since the company’s stock split in 2016, its quarterly dividend payments have grown from $0.16 to $0.305. NKE shares yield a modest 1.3%, but with the company’s growing margins thanks to its digital initiatives and 34% payout ratio, it’s likely that will continue to push higher in the future. In the near term, Nike’s margins are being pressured by a glut of inventory, but sales rose by 10% in the company’s fiscal Q1 when adjusting for currency, which outpaced Nike’s sales growth from FY22.Hedge funds were buying into NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) during Q2 as the stock continued its descent, as there was a 9% uptick in smart money ownership of the company. Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owns the largest NKE stake as of June 30, holding 8.54 million shares. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP sold off 24% of its large Nike position during Q1 and owns 6.73 million shares as of June 30.The RiverPark Large Growth Fund suffered from NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares’ underperformance during Q3, being one of the fund’s top detractors, as outlined in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Nike: NKE shares were a top detractor this quarter on higher inventory balances leading to lower-than-expected gross margins for the next couple of quarters. The company reported 1Q23 sales and EPS beats, but freight costs, markdowns, and the strong dollar weighed on gross margins. Nike continues to expect low double-digit currency-neutral sales growth, but the strong dollar will reduce overall sales growth and discounted inventory will further reduce gross margins for the year.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. After working through its near-term currency and gross margin issues, we expect the company to return towards management’s guidance of at least 10% annual revenue growth, and return to its accelerating profit growth, as longer-term we expect margins to be materially aided by rising average sales prices (from both increased pricing and a mix shift to more premium products), the company’s deep innovation pipeline, a secular shift from the company’s traditional wholesale channels to a more direct-to-consumer approach (now 35% of revenues up from 16% ten years ago), and a more streamlined supply chain. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect the combined gross and operating margin improvements from its initiatives will drive long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”8. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 80 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 17% The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has one of the highest dividend growth rates on this list over the last five years, having more than doubled its dividend payments during that time. The company has a 12-year run of dividend growth and a 45% payout ratio that makes future raises appear to not be an issue. HD shares currently yield 2.54%. Home Depot has a strong balance sheet and should be able to weather any weakness in the housing market, as evidenced by its performance during the financial crisis, when it was still generating a profit during the housing market’s darkest days.Hedge fund ownership of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has jumped for the three straight quarters, increasing by 34% during that time, even as funds have been selling out of the company’s rival Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) in droves. Richard Chilton’s Chilton Investment Company owns one of the most bullish stakes in HD among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database, holding 753,813 shares as of June 30, giving the fund 5.76% 13F exposure to the stock.Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital, which owns 1.26 million The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) shares as of June 30, believes the company is poised to take market share in the professional customer segment, as revealed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a high-quality operator in the home improvement industry. Macroeconomic concerns, particularly the rise in mortgage rates, caused the share price to pull back and trade at a greater discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Home Depot is well positioned to continue gaining share due to its premium real estate locations, strong operations and recent investments in its supply chain. We like Home Depot’s exposure to the professional customer and believe in its ability to take market share in this segment as we believe home improvement spending has the potential to remain resilient in upcoming years.”7. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 82 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12% Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) has raised its quarterly dividend payments by 79% since 2017 and the company’s payout ratio still stands at a miniscule 9%, so similar growth over the next five years is certainly a possibility. DHR shares do sport a tiny yield of 0.40%, but expect that to rise in the years to come.The life sciences company’s sales are slowing rapidly as Covid testing numbers decline, with 2023 revenue growth expected to be just 0.5%. However, longer-term the company has several strong segments that are growing at double-digit rates which will eventually become more visible once Covid testing numbers stabilize or decline enough to no longer offset those gains.Hedge fund ownership of Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) hit an all-time at the end of 2021, with the stock ranking among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds for the first time. The number of funds long DHR has since dipped by 9%. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management and Dan Loeb’s Third Point are among the company’s biggest smart money backers.The Cooper Investors Global Equities Fund is bullish on Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)’s spinoff of its Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions group, as detailed in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Spin-offs have been a valuable source of uncorrelated return for the portfolio since inception, whether investing in them directly or retaining ownership stakes in the spun-off assets of existing holdings. During the quarter Danaher announced the spin of its Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions group (EAS) expected to close in late 2023. Danaher have been masters of the spin over the last decade and once again this one appears to make sense for both parties. The parent becomes a pure-play life sciences and diagnostics business with higher growth, margins and returns plus more M&amp;A firepower. EAS, with leading positions in water quality through assets like Hach, ChemTreat and Trojan will, as a standalone business, have a more focused M&amp;A strategy and represent an attractive water-related exposure for ESG focused funds. The spinco will still operate with the highly regarded Danaher Business System though (like ‘Fortive Business System’) we expect this to get rebranded while still delivering outstanding financial results.”6. UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 91 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 17.7% Closing out the first part of our list is UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), which has been growing its dividend at an impressive rate for several years, pushing its yield up to 1.2%. Its quarterly dividend payments have more than doubled since 2017, including growing by 13.8% earlier this year to $1.65. The managed care insurer grew adjusted diluted EPS by 28.1% year-over-year in Q3 to $5.79, and has significant secular tailwinds that should allow it to continue growing earnings and expanding its margins. With a payout ratio of just 29%, UNH is well positioned to pay out heftier dividends in the years to come.UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) hit triple digits in hedge fund ownership for the first time in Q4 2018 and reached an all-time high of 110 in Q2 of 2021. Ownership of the stock has dipped by 17% in the four quarters since then. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners owns the largest UNH stake among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database, holding 3.11 million shares on June 30. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management owns 2.87 million shares.Carillon Tower Advisers noted that the defensive aspects of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)’s managed care business helped the company perform well relative to the market in Q2, as discussed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported solid quarterly results and raised 2022 guidance modestly. Additionally, managed care is another industry that is viewed as defensive in the current environment, which helped support UnitedHealth and its peer group.”Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

16,44531634-15b8-3739-9abb-eb472f9b07fb,USB,2022-10-31,"Following a 26% decline over last year, recent gains may please U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/following-26-decline-over-last-120120403.html,1667217680,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ']","[Every investor in U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 68% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).After a year of 26% losses, last week’s 5.8% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of U.S. Bancorp. Check out our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in U.S. Bancorp. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of U.S. Bancorp, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in U.S. Bancorp. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.7% by the third-largest shareholder.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that U.S. Bancorp insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$87m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 24% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 8.1% of the U.S. Bancorp shares on issue. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand U.S. Bancorp better, we need to consider many other factors.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best November Dividend Stocks To Buy.Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF) are some of the most prominent companies that are making dividend payments in November 2022.Whether you’re looking to start building out a portfolio of dividend stocks, or fill in some of the monthly gaps in your dividend stocks collection so you have a steady stream of income from them, November is a good month to target.Some of the best dividend stocks on the market, which boast attractive yields and strong dividend growth rates are paying out in November. All of the stocks on this list make their payments in the second half of the month and have yet to pass their ex-dividend date (as of the time of publication), so it’s not too late to add any of them to your portfolio and collect their November dividend payments.Among the top November dividend stocks are more than a dozen Dividend Aristocrats, which are companies that have increased their annual dividend payouts for at least 25 straight years. A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) are just some of the Dividend Aristocrats paying out this month.There are even some Dividend Kings (50+ consecutive years of annual dividend increases) paying out this month that make great additions to any dividend portfolio. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) feature prominently on that list. However, all of the aforementioned stocks have passed their ex-dividend date (the date before which one must be a shareholder of the company to receive its next dividend payment), so none of those companies are included in this list.Even without those major dividend players, the list of best dividend stocks that pay in November isn’t left wanting for strong dividend stocks, as evidenced by the following list. In it, we’ll examine each stock’s dividend history, payout and ex-dividend dates, payout ratio, and other factors so you can make an informed decision about whether or not the stock in question would make a good addition to your dividend portfolio.Story continues10 Best November Dividend Stocks To BuyPhoto by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/Our MethodologyThe following November dividend stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.10 Best November Dividend Stocks To Buy10. Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE:ALX)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 9 November 18 Dividend Payout: $4.50 CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) are some of the major November dividend payers to consider for your portfolio. A lesser known company that also makes its next dividend payment this month is REIT Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE:ALX).Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE:ALX) has paid out dividends for ten straight years, though its quarterly dividend payments have been stalled at $4.50 for the last five years. Nonetheless, the stock boasts an attractive dividend yield of 7.81%. The ex-dividend date for the next payment is November 4.In addition to its dividend payments, there are other potential ways for investors to make money off ALX, as the company reportedly has an interested buyer willing to take it private at a significant premium according to an open letter to ALX shareholders issued by Lionbridge Capital in July. In the letter, Lionbridge urged the company to consider several other changes that could unlock shareholder value, believing that mismanagement has left the company severely underrated by the market. It estimates Alexander’s Net Asset Value to be over $400 per share, more than 70% greater than the stock’s current price.Hedge fund ownership of Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE:ALX) ticked up in Q2 but is down by 31% from its peak reached in the second quarter of 2021. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management and Paul Tudor Jones’ Tudor Investment Corp added ALX to their 13F portfolios during Q2, while Frank Brosens’ Taconic Capital held the largest stake in the company consisting of 142,300 shares.9. Comfort Systems USA, Inc. (NYSE:FIX)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 14 November 28 Dividend Payout: $0.15 Comfort Systems USA, Inc. (NYSE:FIX) has grown its dividend at an impressive CAGR of 13.2% over the past five years, though the stock’s yield is still rather light at just 0.49%. Nonetheless, with a payout ratio of just 11%, this is a dividend stock that could continue to grow at a steady rate for years to come. The ex-dividend date for the company’s next payment is November 16. That payment will be one cent higher for the second time this year and 36% higher than it was two years ago.Comfort Systems USA, Inc. (NYSE:FIX), which provides installation, maintenance, and repair services for heating, air conditioning, and ventilation systems, had a strong Q3 despite warning of cost and input challenges back in July. The company pulled in $1.71 in EPS, which topped estimates by 25%, while its $1.12 billion in revenue also beat estimates. Comfort Systems also has a robust backlog, which should ensure continued organic growth in the quarters to come.The number of smart money managers with long positions in Comfort Systems USA, Inc. (NYSE:FIX) fell by 44% between the middle of 2021 and the end of March 2022, hitting its lowest point in five years. Hedge fund ownership of the stock remained flat during Q2. Chuck Royce’s Royce &amp; Associates maintained the largest position in FIX for the tenth straight quarter, owning 383,851 shares as of June 30 after nearly doubling the size of position during the quarter.8. Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 17 November 23 Dividend Payout: $0.50 There’s been a lot of activity surrounding Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO)’s dividend payments in recent quarters. The company made six consecutive quarterly hikes to its dividend beginning in Q3 2020, and then raised it by another 25% in the second quarter of this year. However, it’s since had to cut its dividend in each of the last two quarters, paring its payout back to Q4 2020 levels. The stock, which has an ex-dividend date of November 8, still has an attractive yield of over 4%.Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO)’s Q2 revenue and EPS took major year-over-year hits, falling to $2.31 billion and $0.56 respectively from $2.9 billion and $1.21 a year earlier, as demand weakens. With Goldman Sachs predicting copper scarcity in the coming years, the company is well positioned to capitalize given its advantageous cost/curve position and sizable exposure to copper.Hedge fund ownership of Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO) fell by 38% between Q1 2021 and Q2 2022, but did tick up slightly during the second quarter. Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake in SCCO, while fellow billionaire Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group added SCCO to its 13F portfolio during the quarter.7. Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 26 November 28 Dividend Payout: $0.28 Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) has nearly tripled the size of its quarterly dividend over the past five years, growing it at an impressive CAGR of 21.9% during that time. That rapid growth has lifted its yield to a respectable 2.38%, and with a payout ratio of just 32%, that yield could push towards 3% in the coming years. The company’s next dividend payment has an ex-dividend date of November 11.A manufacturer of a wide range of home improvement products, Masco did run into some difficulty in Q3, missing its earnings guidance and cutting its full-year outlook, citing weakness in its plumbing and paints segments. The company could face continued pressure throughout next year amid a weakened housing market, but has a strong balance sheet and cash flows that should see it through the period without any risk to its dividend.Hedge funds have been bailing on Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) this year, as there’s been a 36% decline in the number of funds long MAS through the end of June. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Greg Poole’s Echo Street Capital Management were a couple of the funds to unload their stakes in Masco during the second quarter.On the other hand, Oakmark Fund believes the market is undervaluing Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS), as detailed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“We believe the market is failing to properly reward Masco (NYSE:MAS), a leader in home improvement products, for the significant upgrade of its business mix over the past decade. Having previously sold its more cyclical, lower return businesses, such as insulation, windows, and cabinets, what remains are some of the strongest and most recognizable brands in the industry. The company’s portfolio of products-primarily coatings (Behr) and plumbing fixtures (Delta, Hansgrohe)-are more resilient, lower ticket, and higher margin categories. Both segments compete within heavily consolidated industries, exhibit strong pricing power and skew meaningfully toward the less cyclical repair and remodel market. Despite its greatly improved business mix, Masco trades for just 10x next year’s expected earnings, which is a discount to historical levels and comfortably below a market multiple. We believe this dislocation presents an attractive opportunity to invest in a well-managed, high-quality portfolio in a sector that’s currently out of favor.”6. KB Home (NYSE:KBH)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 29 November 23 Dividend Payout: $0.15 Another home-related stock closes out the first half of this list in the form of homebuilder KB Home (NYSE:KBH), whose dividend payments have flat lined this year after rising by 400% between 2018 and 2021. The company has a miniscule payout ratio of just 7%, which is impressive for a stock with a decent yield of just over 2%. The ex-dividend date to collect KBH’s next dividend payment is November 9.With home prices deteriorating, particularly in KB Home (NYSE:KBH)’s core West Coast markets, analysts believe the company may need to sacrifice some of its margins to continue driving sales. RBC Capital analyst Mike Dahl slashed his FY23 EPS forecast for the company to $6.97 from $9.57 in September, but noted that near-term risks are already priced into the stock given that it trades at just 0.7x tangible book value.Hedge fund ownership of KB Home (NYSE:KBH) shot up by 38% during the fourth quarter of 2021 to hit an all-time high, but had since fallen back slightly. Charles Clough’s Clough Capital Partners and Mark Coe’s Intrinsic Edge Capital were some of the funds to add KBH stakes to their portfolios last Q4. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held the largest position in KB Home on June 30, owning 2.43 million shares.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) are among the top dividend stocks to buy in November, check out the details through the link below. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best November Dividend Stocks To Buy. Suggested articles:15 Biggest Cell Phone Companies in the World10 Largest Gas Station Chains in the US10 S&amp;P 500 Stocks with Upside Potential Disclosure: None. 10 Best November Dividend Stocks To Buy is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"
19,d87e8055-79f7-3461-af14-163925d2b6a4,CF,2022-10-31,Investors in CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF) have made a stellar return of 214% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-cf-industries-holdings-nyse-141538566.html,1667139338,STORY,['CF'],"[When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For example, the CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF) share price has soared 174% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 11% gain in the last three months.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for CF Industries Holdings To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the five years of share price growth, CF Industries Holdings moved from a loss to profitability. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains. Given that the company made a profit three years ago, but not five years ago, it is worth looking at the share price returns over the last three years, too. We can see that the CF Industries Holdings share price is up 128% in the last three years. During the same period, EPS grew by 86% each year. This EPS growth is higher than the 32% average annual increase in the share price over the same three years. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 8.20.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how CF Industries Holdings has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. If you are thinking of buying or selling CF Industries Holdings stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, CF Industries Holdings' TSR for the last 5 years was 214%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that CF Industries Holdings has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 89% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 26% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for CF Industries Holdings  you should be aware of, and 1 of them shouldn't be ignored.But note: CF Industries Holdings may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most admired companies in the world.It seems that most companies are facing a reckoning right now. While corporations have often been lambasted because of their capitalistic nature and lack of regard for employees and the general population in lieu of massive profits, the protests against companies seem to have only amplified since the pandemic began. While the Occupy Wall Street protests initially began as a way to oppose the level of money involved in politics and income inequality, with references to the elite 1% holding much of the country's wealth, their ire soon turned to banks and major corporations. However, the protests did not sustain and, after beginning in 2011, faded by 2012.After the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the world, lockdowns were imposed in most countries around the globe and economies came to a standstill, with most business either shut down, or running on a vastly reduced scale. This led to companies laying of millions across the globe, with the hardest hit industries such as the travel industry laying off the most people, with major companies such as The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL) and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) each laying off thousands of employees. Many companies also considered this an opportunity to lay off employees and reduce costs despite record profits, with World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:WWE) one of such companies, laying off dozens of talent despite being at its most profitable.Most Admired Companies in the world in 2022However, the pandemic provided an opportunity to employees which resulted in an improvement in work-life balance in their lives. Many are now refusing to work unless it's completely remote, citing the reduced expenses because of not having to commute, not to mention the invaluable time saved. As the economy rebounded, many businesses realized that they needed more employees to run operations smoothly, only for employees to have realized their self-worth in the meanwhile and not being willing to go back to work under the same conditions that they'd been subjected to earlier. This has also led to the Great Resignation, an ongoing economic trend where employees are resigning en masse, starting in April 2021, where in the United States, more than four million resigned from their jobs, followed by 3.9 million resignations in June 2021.Story continuesThe demand of the employees is similar regardless of class, background and level of experience; better work-life balance, more flexibility and better compensation. According to a study carried out by PwC, 65% of employees said they were looking for a new job while 88% of executives admitted that the rate of turnover in their companies was higher than normal.Companies seem to be coming to the realization that the days of employee loyalty is over, as it should be, and that they need to do a lot more to improve relations between executives and employees. Further, companies are also significantly under fire due to their contributions to climate change. A 2017 report by the Guardian stated that just 100 companies across the world were responsible for 71% of global emissions, which the companies try to cover by attempting to transfer the onus to regular people, as if they're not to blame. In an effort to improve their image, many companies, including of course the most admired companies in the world, are attempting to rectify their contribution to climate change, often pledging to become carbon neutral or at least significantly reducing their carbon emissions over the next decade or two.The most admired companies in the world are also some of the most recognizable. These companies have long realized the importance of retaining and attracting top talent and creating and maintaining and image that has won them plaudits all over the world. We have used Fortune's annual ranking based on corporate reputation for 2021, with the rankings determined from responses from more than 3,700 executives, directors and analysts. These rankings don't insinuate that these are the most ethical companies free from any misdeeds plaguing them, which we'll cover more when talking about each company, but are simply an indication of the reputation and standing of the company. This is why some medical companies have climbed within the list since they've been on the forefront in the battle against the deadliest pandemic in a century. However, while we've chosen the top 20 from Fortune, we have then checked Google Trend statistics for each company. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the most admired companies in the world, starting with number 20:20. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was one of the first pharmaceutical companies to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, which has been essential and integral in allowing the resumption of normal activities across the globe. While Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was nowhere near the top 20 in the previous year, now it kicks off the list of most admired companies in the world as it led by example, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has perhaps been integral in dissipating some of the mistrust the general population has towards the biggest pharmaceutical companies.19. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the biggest conglomerates in the United States. While Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been much maligned for cancer causing talc-based baby powder and was ordered to pay $2.1 billion to the plaintiffs, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was one of the few companies to develop a valid Covid-19 vaccine, which was instrumental in curbing the pandemic.18. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is famous for selling quality items for lower prices and has gained admirers for its focus on sustainability and environmental, social and governance issues by setting measurable goals with the aim to to improve consistently. One of Target Corporation's (NYSE:TGT) recent initiatives includes investing $100 million into Black communities in an effort to combat racism and racial inequality.17. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) being considered an admired company will definitely rankle some feathers. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has faced a ton of lawsuits based on poor working conditions, low wages, poor health care and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) being involved in antiunion activities. The fact that it's still in this list speaks volumes about the disconnect between executives and average employees.16. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Topping the list of the most admired companies in the world for Fortune is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), though it only made it to 16th position in our list.  Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is constantly recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the world as well. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has topped every category used by Fortune in its determination including use of corporate assets, innovation, social responsibility, financial soundness, quality of management, quality of products and services and global competitiveness.15. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A)Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), run by the legendary Warren Buffett, is admired primarily because of the way its been run by the famous investor. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A) is the largest financial services company in the world by revenue.14. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the most well-known companies in the world. In fact, odds are if you're reading this article on a laptop, you're using Microsoft Windows to run your computer! Regularly rated as one of the best places to work at, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) encourages creativity and is held in high regards by its employees.13. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is one of the biggest chains in the world, with more than 33,000 stores globally.

Although the US Federal Reserve has increased benchmark interest rates five times in 2022, the increase in inflation is showing minimal signs of slowing down and coming close to the Fed’s target of 2%. During such times, the best real estate stocks offer safe long-term investment opportunities to shareholders with attractive dividend yields. Furthermore, these real estate companies lease out the properties owned by them and enjoy the benefit of a regular increase in rent. The rent increase is usually indexed against the consumer price index (CPI), which aids these companies in growing their income in line with the inflation levels.A majority of the best real estate stocks are structured as real estate investment trusts (REITs). REITs are entities that generate 75% of their income from the assets under their ownership which can be either real estate, cash, or US treasuries. Furthermore, they are required to give back at least 90% of their taxable income as dividends to shareholders. According to Nareit, all types of REITs in the US collectively own $4.5 trillion worth of gross assets, and publicly listed REITs own two-thirds of these assets.

Another decade of oil demand growth would be a boost for OPEC, whose 13 members depend on oil income. The group has been arguing that oil should be part of the energy transition and that focus by investors on economic, social and governance (ESG) issues has worsened an investment shortfall. ""The overall investment number for the oil sector is $12.1 trillion out to 2045,"" OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais wrote in the foreword to the report, which said the figure was up from last year's estimate. ""However, chronic underinvestment into the global oil industry in recent years, due to industry downturns, the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as policies centred on ending financing in fossil fuel projects, is a major cause of concern."" OPEC made a shift in 2020 when the pandemic hit demand, saying it would eventually slow after years of predicting ever-increasing consumption. In the report, OPEC maintained its view that world demand will plateau after 2035.GRAPHIC: OPEC World Oil Demand Forecast https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zgpobwzamvd/Pasted%20image%201667239252245.pngOther predictions from companies and banks see oil demand peaking earlier. The International Energy Agency on Thursday for the first time in its history of modelling said demand for all fossil fuels was set to peak, with oil demand levelling off in the middle of the next decade. ENERGY SECURITY DEMAND BOOST The report said world oil demand will reach 103 million barrels per day in 2023, up 2.7 million bpd from 2022. The 2023 total demand is up 1.4 million bpd from last year's prediction. OPEC also raised its demand forecasts for the medium term to 2027, saying the figure is up by almost 2 million bpd by the end of the period from last year. It said the upward revision reflects a more robust recovery now seen in 2022 and 2023 and a ""strong focus on energy security issues"" leading to a slower substitution of oil by other fuels such as natural gas, whose price has soared due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. By 2030, OPEC sees world demand averaging 108.3 million bpd, up from 2021, and lifted its 2045 figure to 109.8 million bpd from 108.2 million bpd in 2021. The group had lowered the 2045projection over the last few years. OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, are again cutting supply to support the market. The report sees supply restraint continuing in the medium term, with OPEC output in 2027 lower than in 2022 as non-OPEC supply grows. Still, OPEC is upbeat about its later prospects, seeing its market share rising. U.S. tight crude supply is seen peakingafter the late 2020s, rather than around 2030 last year. ""Oil is expected to remain the number one fuel in the global primary energy mix,"" the report said.(Reporting by Alex Lawler; editing by David Evans)]"

Nevertheless, we think the space has fuel in the tank, especially for the operators that target growth opportunities and operating efficiency initiatives. We advise investors to focus on upstream firms like Canadian Natural Resources CNQ, Ovintiv OVV  and Enerplus ERF that are expected to gain traction despite the existing headwinds.About the IndustryThe Zacks Oil and Gas - US E&amp;P industry consists of companies primarily based in the domestic market, focused on the exploration and production (E&amp;P) of oil and natural gas. These firms find hydrocarbon reservoirs, drill oil and gas wells, and produce and sell these materials to be refined later into products such as gasoline, fuel oil, distillate, etc. The economics of oil and gas supply and demand is the fundamental driver of this industry. In particular, a producer’s cash flow is primarily determined by the realized commodity prices. In fact, all E&amp;P companies' results are vulnerable to historically volatile prices in the energy markets. A change in realizations affects their returns and causes them to alter their production growth rates. The E&amp;P operators are also exposed to exploration risks where drilling results are comparatively uncertain.3 Key Investing Trends to Watch in the Oil and Gas - Canadian E&amp;P IndustryBackdrop of a Tightening Market: Earlier this year, the price of WCS crude — the Canadian benchmark — rose above $100 a barrel to reach its highest since 2008 on account of Russia’s launch of military operations in Ukraine. While oil has pulled back from those lofty levels, there is no sign of a quick resolution to the conflict, the risk of dwindling inventory and chances of the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC agreeing on a production curtailment. These give the commodity enough reasons to stay elevated in the near to medium term. What’s more, the commodity could spike further if the United States decides to tap Canada to replace its imports from Moscow that has been banned by the Biden administration. With even natural gas realizations remaining healthy amid the macro tailwinds, the E&amp;P companies will greatly benefit for obvious reasons. Importantly, commodity prices appear to have entered a protracted period of stability at levels where the operators can generate free cash flow through their drilling activities to pay dividends or buy back their own stock.  Inflationary Cost Pressures: Canadian energy companies have been experiencing rising production costs in the form of increased expenses related to steel, manufactured goods, services and labor. The inflationary environment, together with supply-chain tightness, is not only pushing costs higher but also affecting their capital programs. Apart from being hard to ignore, escalation in expenses is also drowning out the benefits of higher commodity prices. In our view, the inflation-associated headwinds will continue to challenge growth and margin numbers, with little chance of a quick resolution. Finally, what this means is that the central bank will be persistent with its aggressive policy of raising rates to stem inflation, which may lead to a rough road for oil/gas equities. In particular, worries about weaker energy demand due to the threat of recession (spurred by rising interest rates and slowing consumer spending) might jeopardize the post-pandemic rebound in commodity consumption.     Lack of Pipeline Availability: Energy consultant IHS Markit sees oil production in Canada surging by some 900,000 barrels per day during the 2020-2030 period. Despite this impressive output growth, the country's exploration and production sector has remained out of favor, primarily due to the scarcity of pipelines. In short, pipeline construction in Canada has failed to keep pace with rising domestic crude volumes — the heavier sour variety churned out of the oil sands — resulting in an infrastructural bottleneck. This has forced producers to give away their products in the United States — Canada’s major market — at a discounted rate. As it is, Canadian heavy crude is inferior to the higher-quality oil extracted from shale formations in the United States and is more expensive to transport and refine. Following U.S. President Joe Biden’s revocation of TC Energy’s contentious Keystone XL pipeline and the company’s subsequent termination of the project, Canadian oil sands producers will have to wait a little longer for the takeaway capacity issue to be resolved.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Canadian E&amp;P is a seven-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #197, which places it in the bottom 21% of some 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates challenging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Despite the dim near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Canadian E&amp;P has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil - Energy Sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has gained 28.7% over this period compared with the broader sector’s increase of 26.3%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 16.8%.One-Year Price Performance Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of non-cash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio, the industry is currently trading at 3.44X, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 11.94X. It is also below the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.69X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 11.74X, as low as 2.81X, with a median of 5.34X, as the chart below shows.Trailing 12-Month Enterprise Value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio (Past Five Years) Stocks to Watch ForEnerplus: An upstream operator, Enerplus focuses on Bakken and Three Forks formations in the Williston Basin in North Dakota, together with interests in the Marcellus Basin and waterflood projects in Canada. Banking on its low financial leverage and robust liquidity, ERF is in a pole position to take advantage of the sharply higher commodity prices.Over 90 days, Enerplus has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 increase 7.8%. Sporting a market capitalization of around $3.9 billion, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) ERF’s shares have surged 74% in a year.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Price and Consensus: ERF Canadian Natural Resources: This Calgary-based energy major boasts a diversified portfolio of crude oil (heavy as well as light), natural gas, bitumen and synthetic crude oil. CNQ’s balanced and diverse production mix facilitates long-term value and reduces the risk profile, thereby lending its results a high level of stability. Lower capital expenditure needs, accretive acquisitions and improving operational efficiencies are the other positives in the Canadian Natural story, which allowed the company to generate a significant free cash flow of C$6.7 billion (post capital spending and dividends) in the first half of 2022.Notably, CNQ beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 15.5%, on average. Canadian Natural, with a Zacks Rank of 3, has seen its shares gain 38.4% in a year.Price and Consensus: CNQ Ovintiv: An upstream operator, Ovintiv (formerly known as Encana) holds an attractive oil and gas production portfolio in three major North American unconventional basins: Montney, Anadarko and the Permian. Following the Newfield acquisition in 2019, the company has achieved higher liquids focus, greater scale and cost synergies. Ovintiv has also done a commendable job of cutting its expenses in a disciplined manner, which should boost free cash flow generation.Headquartered in Denver, CO, Ovintiv has a projected earnings growth rate of 75.7% for this year. OVV’s expected EPS growth rate for three to five years is currently 46.7%, which compares favorably with the industry's growth rate of 29.4%. Ovintiv, a Zacks Rank #3 stock, has seen its shares go up 30.9% in a year.Price and Consensus: OVV Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, the P/E might be low for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Morgan Stanley's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. It seems that many are expecting the dour earnings performance to persist, which has repressed the P/E. If this is the case, then existing shareholders will probably struggle to get excited about the future direction of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Morgan Stanley will help you uncover what's on the horizon.How Is Morgan Stanley's Growth Trending?Morgan Stanley's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver limited growth, and importantly, perform worse than the market.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 12%. However, a few very strong years before that means that it was still able to grow EPS by an impressive 50% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would probably welcome the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 9.7% per year over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.8% per annum, which is not materially different.In light of this, it's peculiar that Morgan Stanley's P/E sits below the majority of other companies. Apparently some shareholders are doubtful of the forecasts and have been accepting lower selling prices.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Morgan Stanley's P/EWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Our examination of Morgan Stanley's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't contributing to its P/E as much as we would have predicted. There could be some unobserved threats to earnings preventing the P/E ratio from matching the outlook. At least the risk of a price drop looks to be subdued, but investors seem to think future earnings could see some volatility.Many other vital risk factors can be found on the company's balance sheet.

41,1e676792-9a7a-3e02-8552-46f2b8cc4bc1,MRO,2022-10-31,Marathon (MRO) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in Store?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-mro-report-q3-earnings-120712492.html,1667218032,STORY,"['MRO', 'CNQ', 'MUR']","[Marathon Oil Corporation MRO is set to release third-quarter results on Nov 2. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of $1.19 per share on revenues of $2.1 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the independent oil and gas producer’s performance in the September quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at MRO’s previous-quarter results first.Highlights of Q2 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the Houston, TX-based upstream player beat the consensus mark on stronger liquid realizations and solid domestic production. MRO had reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.32, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23. Revenues of $2.3 billion generated by the firm also came in 9.9% above the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Marathon beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters, resulting in an earnings surprise of 19.3%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMarathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMarathon Oil Corporation price-eps-surprise | Marathon Oil Corporation Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter bottom line has remained the same in the last seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 205.1% jump year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 42.5% increase from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderMarathon is likely to have cashed in on the strength in hydrocarbon realizations. In the previous three-month period, MRO’s key U.S. E&amp;P segment realized average liquids prices (crude oil and condensate) of $110.10 per barrel — significantly above the year-earlier level of $64.73. Additionally, average realized natural gas prices were up 162.1% year over year to $6.84 per thousand cubic feet. The increase in price is most likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, with commodity prices remaining high on the back of geopolitical tensions, strained supply and robust demand. This price boost is likely to have buoyed the third-quarter revenues and cash flows of Marathon.MRO is also expected to have benefited from higher production during the September period. In the second quarter of 2022, the company’s net production from the domestic unit averaged 283,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d). Considering MRO’s impressive production profile from its high-margin U.S. resource plays (Eagle Ford, Bakken, Oklahoma and Permian), the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter volume is pegged at 289,000 BOE/d, indicating an increase of 2.1% from the June quarter.On a somewhat bearish note, the increase in Marathon’s costs might have dented the company’s to-be-reported bottom line. MRO’s production costs in the second quarter increased around 30.2% year over year to $164 million. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the third quarter due to cost inflation and higher energy prices.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Marathon Oil is likely to beat estimates in the third quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates.

His hedge fund aims to integrate sustainability into the investment process and uses related tools to carry out the financial analysis.In one of his interviews with NordSip this September, Al Gore discussed the availability of various political and economic solutions to tackle climate change. He also talked about the Inflation Reduction Act and said that all countries need to take more ambitious steps to reverse the climate crisis. In another interview with Reuters last month, Al Gore said that the current environment with rising oil prices can encourage governments to decarbonize faster. He further mentioned that investments in a clean economy are expected to exceed $1 trillion over the next few years.Al Gore's firm launched a new fund earlier this year that targets companies contributing to lower emissions. The $1.7 billion Sustainable Solutions Fund IV will allow the hedge fund to invest in corporations that are shifting their industries and operations toward sustainability. Moreover, the fund recently announced its collaboration with other ESG-centric programs to make investments in limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Overall ESG stocks are gaining ground among investors as they try to increase their sustainable investing exposure. Since 2010, ESG funds have significantly outperformed non-ESG funds in America and Europe, according to a report by Economist.At the end of Q2 2022, Generation Investment Management’s 13F portfolio had a total value of over $18.3 billion, compared with $21.8 billion in the previous quarter.

The company also focuses on its environmental and social responsibility which influences its decision-making processes.Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) started paying dividends to its shareholders in 2003 and has raised its dividends 70 times since then. This makes the company one of the best dividend stocks on our list. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.301 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.94%, as of October 28.Generation Investment Management started investing in Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) during the second quarter of 2018, purchasing shares worth over $31 million. In Q2 2022, the hedge fund owned over 1.3 million shares in the company, worth over $76.6 million.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP), the microcontroller (MCU) and analog semiconductor producer, was also a primary detractor for the period. Shares declined during the quarter despite strong fundamentals, as the company posted its fifth consecutive quarter of record revenues. After years of industry consolidation and cost cutting, led by Microchip’s disciplined and frugal executives, the business is executing on our catalyst of enhanced profitability, with operating margins exceeding 40%. FREE cash flow generation has continued to improve, allowing the company to pay out $1.6 billion in dividends and repurchase $426 million shares since fiscal year 2019. Having paid down $5 billion in debt during the same period, Microchip’s credit rating was upgraded to investment grade in 2021, reflecting its higher-quality balance sheet. While we recognize Microchip operates in a cyclical industry, we admire the company’s history of strong FREE cash flow generation through the cycles. Moreover, our conviction remains in Microchip’s ability to grow its market share while uniquely benefiting from the secular trend of expanded usage of MCUs across segments that include 5G products, Internet of Things (IoT), data centers, electric vehicles and autonomous driving systems.”10. The Cooper Companies, Inc. (NYSE:COO)Generation Investment Management's Stake Value: $394,222,000The Cooper Companies, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“The Cooper Companies, Inc. (NYSE:COO) is the second largest contact lens manufacturer and a leading provider of women’s health and fertility products and services. We believe the company is well positioned to benefit from several profit cycle drivers. First, a broad shift from reusable contact lenses to soft, daily disposable lenses is underway. The convenience of less upkeep and increased comfort makes daily lenses an attractive option with higher recurring revenues to Cooper. We are also drawn to the company’s MiSight soft contact lens product, which is used to treat myopia (nearsightedness). Myopia is a global health issue—associated with increased screen time and indoor activity—affecting ~30% of the population and is expected to reach 50% over the coming decades (with particularly high prevalence among children). MiSight is the first and only FDA-approved myopia control contact lens, and we believe it could open a multi-billion-dollar market and be a meaningful growth driver in the years ahead. Meanwhile, the company has made several acquisitions to accelerate the growth of its smaller (~25% of revenue) women’s health business.”9. Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL)Generation Investment Management's Stake Value: $408,039,000Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL) is an Arizona-based manufacturing company that specializes in a wide range of products including optical fibers and defense electronics.

Here is what the firm has to say:“CSL’s recent update indicated that the worst COVID-19 impacts on the business are likely past, with plasma collections now snapping back. CSL’s core business continues to enjoy significant competitive advantages, in our view, and, as collected plasma is processed into finished products, we believe sales will return to their pre-COVID-19 levels. It will take time for this to play out, but it is a welcome improvement. Most of the other segments of the business are performing well, and steady demand for CSL’s products, which are less economically sensitive, has likely contributed to the stability of shares recently.”8.

This week’s list includes Amazon AMZN, Meta META, Alphabet GOOGL and Microsoft MSFTMaking Sense of Big Tech Earnings After FANG DisappointmentsThe earnings bombshells from Amazon and Meta and sub-par releases from Alphabet and Microsoft have forced us all to revisit our long-held assumptions about the sustainability of these technology leaders' earnings power.Apple(AAPL) has redeemed itself with its quarterly release, cementing its leadership credentials and its 'Rock of Gibraltar' status in the eyes of its legion of supporters.Apple's solid results aside, the questions appear to be mostly about the outlook for Amazon and Meta, as Alphabet and Microsoft's results weren't really that bad. Some of that differentiation was clear from the stock market reaction to the results as well, with Amazon and Meta shares literally being taken to the woodshed following the releases.The one thing that is becoming clear after results from these 'Big 5 Tech Players' is that none of these their profitability is Teflon coated and immune from cyclical forces. Apple may be looking invincible today in the afterglow of its quarterly report, but the consumer decision to purchase the company's pricey phones and other devices will also always remain a discretionary choice and vulnerable to economic forces.Q3 earnings for the 'Big 5 Tech Players' in the aggregate are down -15.2% from the same period last year on +9.4% higher revenues.For 2022 as a whole, the group is expected to bring in -13.2% lower earnings on +6.1% higher revenues. But growth is expected to resume next year, as you can see in the chart below that shows the group's earnings and revenue picture on an annual basis.One possible explanation for this group's growth challenge is the all-around margin pressures, a function of their bulging payrolls, particularly for Amazon, Meta and Alphabet. One could say that if they move into the management mode of other blue-chip operators by getting on top of their expenses, they can help strengthen their profitability.Story continuesAmazon hired a ton of workers during Covid to meet the surging demand as all of us stopped going to stores. The question now is whether they need to let some of those workers go as Covid restrictions are mostly in the rear-view mirror now.In addition to the group's margin challenge, there are two key factors that will drive their profitability over the next two years.The first factor is the unusual impact of Covid on their profitability in the last two years. You can see some of that from the 2021 growth figures in the above chart. The chart below shows the aggregate dollar earnings for the group in the last 6 years and estimates for the next two years.We have highlighted above the two years that benefited from the Covid effects. The question now is whether the +58% jump in 2021 earnings brought forward profits from 2022 only, or did it include 2023 as well?The second factor is related to the impact of macroeconomic forces on profitability. Microsoft's business was affected not only by the slump in PC demand, a function of post-Covid adjustments, but also by growth deceleration in the cloud business. We saw similar cloud-centric challenges in the Amazon and Alphabet reports as well.This cloud deceleration is likely a reflection of companies cutting back on so-called enterprise spending, on top of digital advertising spending. The market was under the impression that cloud spending was effectively immune from economic forces and would not experience any cuts. The numbers from Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet show otherwise.This brings us back to evaluating the seemingly Teflon-coated status of Apple's gadgets and services.I am of the opinion that once the Fed's tighter policy regime produces cracks in the labor market, we will end up discovering that consumers rationally defer replacing their older devices with newer ones. We are not there yet because the labor market is rock solid, but we could very well reach that stage in either of the coming two quarterly reports. Q3 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all of the reports through Friday, October 28th, we now have Q3 results from 263 S&amp;P 500 members that combined account for 52.6% of the index's total market capitalization.We have another super busy reporting docket this week, with results from more than 1,100 companies on deck, including results from 163 S&amp;P 500 members.For the 263 index members that have reported results already, total earnings are down –0.6% from the same period last year on +11.3% higher revenues, with 71.9% beating EPS estimates and 63.1% beating revenue estimates.The EPS and revenue beats percentages were notably on the weak side earlier in the reporting cycle. But as you can see above, they are very much within the historical range by now.The Earnings Big Picture2022 Q3 earnings are expected to be up +1% on +9.4% higher revenues.Don't forget that it is the strong contribution from the Energy sector that is keeping the aggregate Q3 earnings growth in positive territory. Excluding the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the S&amp;P 500 index would be down -6.4% from the same period last year.As we have consistently been pointing out, estimates are coming down, both for the current period (2022 Q4) as well as full-year 2023.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Earnings Picture is Good, But Not Great  Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

45,86476ac0-e352-31ec-a57c-241871d5878d,MSFT,2022-10-31,Aspen Technology and Atlassian have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aspen-technology-atlassian-highlighted-zacks-115611051.html,1667217371,STORY,"['AZPN', 'TEAM', 'AMZN', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 31, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Aspen Technology AZPN as the Bull of the Day and Atlassian TEAM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Aspen Technology, aka AspenTech, is a $15 billion provider of industrial software that helps manufacturers and engineering firms monitor and optimize their operations in a process commonly referred to as asset performance management (APM).Their most recent quarterly report on October 26 blew away all expectations with a 75%+ beat on the bottom line EPS. But the stock fell from all-time highs above $260 to $235 on Thursday as lots of technology got slammed after weak reports from Amazon and META Platforms shook the sector.AZPN was already a Zacks #1 Rank headed into the quarter as analysts were raising estimates on new deals, partnerships, and customers.And they will be submitting new upward revisions this week as they digest the report and re-calibrate their models.AZPN Quarter DetailsAspenTech reported first-quarter fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings of $2.20 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23. The company reported non-GAAP earnings of 31 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Revenues of $250.8 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.3%. The company reported revenues of $77 million in the year-ago quarter.The top-line performance was driven by the acquisition of Emerson's business units. The integration of Emerson's OSI and GSS businesses with Aspen will aid the the company to move toward its token licensing model.AZPN Analyst ReactionKeyBanc analyst Jason Celino raised the firm's price target on Aspen Technology to $280 from $270 to reflect his growing confidence in acceleration opportunities, and how the company has executed on multiple fronts regarding its integration plans with DGM and SSEStory continuesCelino noted that AspenTech posted slightly better Q1 ACV growth of 7.7%, though heritage annual spend growth came in modestly below. ""The company continues to see positive demand trends across its business, though remains vigilant on macro, and is reiterating its full year 2023 ACV growth guidance of 10.5%-13.5%.""Celino has been a diligent and accurate bull on AZPN for several years as we'll see coming up. It's worth noting that he hiked his outlook and PT from $227 to $270 just a week ago ahead of earnings.And here was his move in July as AZPN was about to acquire significant Oil &amp; Gas asset technology and contracts from Emerson Electric (EMR), which acquired 55% of the company in May...KeyBanc analyst Jason Celino raised the firm's price target on Aspen Technology to $210 from $175. The analyst believes Aspen is positioned to ""see a multi-quarter acceleration back to double-digit annual spend growth, which is supported by a strong oil and gas end market backdrop.""Celino added that, with the transaction with Emerson now behind it, he rolls forward the firm's model to FY24 for the combined company, with a higher price target of $210 based on 30x FY24 enterprise value/free cash flow and a bull case price target of $235 based on 32x FY24.What Is APM and Why Does It Matter?AspenTech solutions aid in optimizing process manufacturing by supporting real-time decision making, predicting equipment failure, and providing the ability to forecast and simulate potential actions.Asset management solutions not only assist manufacturers in understanding the operating conditions of their assets but also to take appropriate actions to increase their productivity in an efficient way.In the era of automation and artificial intelligence (AI), AspenTech talks of the ""self-optimizing plant"" that can use Industrial AI technology to enable companies to make plants increasingly autonomous and optimize across functions.For more on AI in the latest industrial developments, see my recent Zacks Confidential report on the primary architect of Industrial AI, NVIDIA...Omniverse is the Engine for the MetaverseYou can request a copy by contacting Ultimate@Zacks.com -- and tell them Cooker sent you!Old School Modeling Gets AI FaceliftHere's what I wrote in my 2020 article...AspenTech is the oldest industrial software company you've never heard of. They got their start over four decades ago modeling chemical processes for oil and gas companies during the energy crisis that began in the 1970s.As their PR video says ""Not long after that, we started moving companies away from the dials and knobs and kicked off a digital revolution in the process industries.""AspenTech was put on my radar not merely because of its frequent visits to the upper realms of the Zacks Rank earnings momentum model, but also because of a significant AI acquisition they made almost four years ago. Here was the press release...AspenTech Acquires MtellWill Add Predictive and Prescriptive Maintenance Technology to aspenONE® Software; Extends Company's Asset Optimization OfferingsBedford, MA -Aspen Technology, Inc., a leading provider of software and services to the process industries, announced it has acquired Mtelligence Corporation (known as Mtell), a San Diego, California-based pioneer in the field of predictive and prescriptive maintenance for asset performance optimization.Mtell products enable companies to increase asset utilization and avoid unplanned downtime by accurately predicting when equipment failures will occur, understanding why they will occur, and prescribing what to do to avoid the failure.The products provide a low-touch, rapidly deployable, end-to-end solution that combines a deep understanding of operations and maintenance processes, real-time and historical equipment data and cutting-edge machine learning technologies. As a result, customers can:Monitor the health of equipment, detect early failure symptoms, diagnose their root-cause and recommend the best responses to avoid the failureContinually learn and automatically adapt to changing equipment and process behaviorsAutomatically share findings across a network of similar equipment to improve the overall process performance.Some of the world's largest process manufacturing companies use Mtell software to detect and avoid failures well in advance of an actual breakdown, optimizing the performance of their assets. Customer results have shown significant benefits including improved industrial safety, removal of risk, reduced failures, enhanced productivity and increased profitability.The AI Brains Behind MtellThe co-founder of Mtell was Alex Bates who performed DARPA-funded research in neural networks as an undergrad, as well as research in memory and computational diagnostics. Next he jumped into the private sector, applying analytics on some of the world's largest data warehouses at Teradata, a pioneer in big data / MPP database technology.A lead inventor on 3 patents in the area of sensor networks and machine learning, in 2006 Bates co-founded Mtelligence (Mtell) to harness the deluge of sensor data in the industrial IoT, with a mission to create a world that doesn't break down. Mtell's machine learning platform is used to monitor global fleets of offshore drilling rigs, railroad engines, and process equipment, in effect creating a distributed immune system to protect equipment and personnel.The AspenTech website describes a case study where Mtell technology examined pump and compressor assets for a major oil &amp; gas refinery with hundreds of sensors in play at once. Aspen Mtell analyzed 220 million sensor values to identify the top 10 maintenance cost failures and predicted a compressor breakdown 49 days in advance.This is similar to what Alteryx (AYX) allowed Royal Dutch Shell to do, helping them create predictive analytics for forecasting asset failures on off-shore drilling rigs.Here's how AspenTech describes the evolution of Industrial AI for modern asset performance management...Traditional preventive maintenance alone cannot solve the problems of unexpected breakdowns. With asset performance management powered by low-touch machine learning, it's now possible to extract value from decades of process, asset and maintenance data to optimize asset performance.Since Bates was clearly ahead of the curve with machine learning, I'm eager to learn more from him and am currently reading his book Augmented Mind: AI, Humans, and the Superhuman Revolution that he published in 2019 through his investment and research firm Neocortex Ventures.Big Beat &amp; Raise QuarterClearly, the downturn in oil and gas markets impacted AspenTech business and the company had to lower expectations in their Q3 report in May 2020. But you'd never know it looking at what just happened, causing shares to jump from $98 to $128 this month.KeyBanc analyst Celino wrote ""While the downturn in oil end markets presented near-term headwinds, we are confident in the company's best in class execution and more durable business model.""And so after his thesis about AZPN was confirmed in the June quarter, Celino felt compelled to raise his outlook again. On August 13, he raised his price target on AZPN to $137 from $120. Most impressive to him was the 6%-9% 2021 annual spend guidance, which was much higher than his previewed expectations of 3%-5% year-over-year growth. Celino also pointed out that despite a tough end market backdrop, the company's continued execution reinforces his long-term confidence that Aspen remains a core name to own.While that spend metric is important to the KeyBanc analyst, I'm more focused on the company's growth in a total addressable market for big data and machine learning analytics in the tens of billions. AZPN's projected surge of 23.5% in revenues to $729 million this fiscal year will exceed the last TTM peak of $618M by 18%.And the 37% expected jump in profits is just icing on that Industrial AI cake. While the valuation at nearly 12X sales is rich, I would look to be a long-term buyer on pullbacks under $120.(end of my 2020 research notes)Bottom line: Buy AZPM on this pullback. And follow Celino and Cooker to keep up with latest developments in AI/ML and ""deep learning"" automation technologies from NVIDIA and others.Disclosure: I own shares of NVDA and Alteryx competitor Splunk in the data ""mining and modeling"" space for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Bear of the Day:Atlassian is a $50 billion provider of a suite of cloud-based software solutions that help organizations collaborate and manage their workforce such that the teams communicate and work better together.Initially, Atlassian's products, like JIRA, were designed to help software developer teams communicate, collaborate, and manage the design and delivery cycle of software, similar to the ubiquitous Slack app that Salesforce acquired last year.Over the years, uses of Atlassian's solutions have expanded virally to teams across diverse industries.EPS Estimates Drop After Analyst ReactionsAtlassian reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 non-IFRS earnings per share (EPS) of 27 cents beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents. The figure increased 12.5% from the year-ago quarter's non-IFRS earnings of 24 cents per share.Atlassian's fiscal fourth-quarter revenues surged 36% to $760 million and surpassed the consensus mark of $717.8 million. The company witnessed solid demand for its cloud-based products, primarily led by smaller customers. Meanwhile, the cloud migration momentum continued for larger clients.Since first-quarter fiscal 2022, Atlassian modified its revenue reporting style. Based on deployment options, the company started reporting revenues under four segments — cloud, data center, server, and marketplace and services. Also, it started excluding Trello single-user accounts while updating its active customer count from the first quarter of fiscal 2022 onward.During the quarter under review reported in early August, cloud revenues were $434 million, indicating 55% year-over-year growth. Meanwhile, revenues from the data center surged 60% to $158.9 million. Marketplace and services revenues were $49.3 million, reflecting a 24% year-over-year downfall. Revenues from Server declined 16% to $117.6 million.The company's non-IFRS gross profit climbed 35.9% year over year to $644 million. Non-IFRS gross margin contracted 10 basis points (bps) to 84.8% during the quarter.Atlassian's non-IFRS operating income increased 14.8% year over year to $108.9 million, while its operating margin contracted 300 bps to 14%.In late October, Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz lowered the firm's price target on Atlassian to $320 from $360 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. Software stocks ""remain besieged"" by high inflation, rising yields, supply chain constraints, currency headwinds, and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, the analyst told investors in a research note.While fundamental checks ""have been healthy overall,"" they have ""again picked up indications of uneven demand,"" he noted. The analyst cut price targets but says a lot of risk is now priced into software shares.Fiscal 2022 HighlightsAtlassian's fiscal 2022 revenues grew 34% year over year to $2.8 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.76 billion. The company reported non-IFRS earnings of $1.69 per share for the fiscal, which matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate but outpaced the year-ago quarter's earnings of $1.40 per share.Balance SheetThe company ended the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.46 billion, up from $1.28 billion at the end of the third quarter.During the fourth quarter, TEAM generated operating and free cash flow of $230 million and $194.7 million, respectively. In fiscal 2022, the company generated operating and free cash flow of $883.5 million and $763.8 million, respectively.TEAM OutlookFor the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the company anticipates revenues between $795 million and $810 million. Atlassian's fiscal first-quarter revenue guidance is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $761.9 million.Non-IFRS gross margin is estimated to be 84-85%. Non-IFRS operating margin is projected to be approximately 18%. The company anticipates reporting non-IFRS EPS of 37 to 38 cents approximately. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter earnings is pegged at 33 cents per share.Quarter DetailsDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Atlassian added 8,048 net new customers, bringing the total count to 242,623 customers on an active subscription or maintenance agreement basis. A large number of customers are opting for cloud offerings amid the ongoing cloud migration. Such new additions and increased pricing on certain products contributed to the company's quarterly revenues.Segment-wise, Subscription revenues surged 55% year over year to $597.3 million. Sales from the Maintenance business decreased 11% year over year to $117.1 million, while Other revenues (which included perpetual license revenues) jumped 6% year over year to $45.4 million.Additional content:What Is Happening in the Cloud?This is turning out to be one of the worst quarters for technology companies in a long time. Most are missing estimates on multiple fronts, or managing to beat lowered expectations. One area that deserves special focus just because it has been so strong of late is the cloud. Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon are three major players in the space. So management commentary coming out of their earnings calls tells us a lot about the state of the market.It turns out that the general sentiment, near term challenges and long-term potential that the companies are seeing are very similar.Alphabet's management said on the call that ""As companies globally are looking to drive efficiencies, Google Cloud's open infrastructure creates a valuable pathway to reduce IT costs and modernize.""Microsoft said, ""The way we see it is, overall, macro will mean that everybody is going to optimize their build. In fact... our job number one for large swaths of our sort of even customer-facing organizations is to proactively help them optimize. In fact, our incentives in our customer success teams are lined up with them, helping customers 'do more with less.'""So that's sort of one side. The thing, though, from a customer perspective, the best way for them to align their spend with what is uncertain demand is to move to the cloud. So we see the value prop of the cloud. So the big winner in all of this will be public cloud, because public cloud helps businesses offset the risk of taking demand risk.""Amazon's management also upheld this view: ""We think the benefit of cloud computing is really showing up right now because we allow customers to turn what can normally be a fixed expense into a variable expense, and they can let us manage the highs and lows of inflation and other cost of electricity and everything else. So I think just like in 2020, these time periods are good for long-term adoption on cloud computing.""However, while Alphabet's cloud revenue in the just-reported quarter was better than expected, the others were not so lucky. The stronger dollar hurt all three, because of the volume of revenues generated overseas.Alphabet said, ""We are pleased with the ongoing momentum. It's across a wide range of industries and geographies. And it really comes back to the team's focus on helping them solve unique business issues and innovate in new areas as they digitally transform."" But management's tone about the near-term outlook was cautious, recalling what they said last quarter as well: ""in some cases, certain customers are taking longer to decide, and some have committed to deals with shorter terms or smaller deal sizes, which we attribute to a more challenging macro environment. Some are impacted due to reasons that are specific to their business. But overall, as you can see from the results here again, we're pleased with the momentum in Cloud.""While reiterating that the company continued ""to see growth in the number of large long-term Azure and Microsoft 365 contracts across all deal sizes,"" Microsoft's management also said that they expect moderation in the 365 growth rate given the size of the installed base.The other factor that impacted results in the last quarter is also expected to influence results in the current quarter: The lower-than-expected growth in Azure and other cloud services revenue was ""driven by the continued moderation in Azure consumption growth, as we help customers optimize current workloads while they prioritize new workloads."" Hybrid demand continued to spur the on-premise server business with particular strength on the annuity side, ahead of the SQL Server 2022 launch.Amazon attributed the last quarter's performance to macro weakness. ""With the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, we've seen an uptick in AWS customers focused on controlling costs. And we're proactively working to help customers cost optimize, just as we've done throughout AWS' history, especially in periods of economic uncertainty. The breadth and depth of our service offerings enable us to help them do things like move storage to lower-priced tiers options and shift workloads to our Graviton chips.""Margins are also a concern for Amazon: ""We're also seeing energy costs that are materially higher than they had in pre-pandemic, electricity and the impact of natural gas pricing. So those prices have up more than two times over the last couple of years and contribute to about 200 basis point degradation versus two years ago. So we're fighting through some of that as well, which is a new thing for the AWS business. But we'll continue to look for ways to optimize our operations to use less energy.""Amazon also thinks there is considerable uncertainty in the short run: ""The offset in the short run is that some companies have demand that drops. I think what was different in 2020 was there were companies that went down and there's companies that went up quite a bit that were servicing high volumes during the pandemic. So that dynamic is not in place right now, and I think everyone is just cautious and they want to, again, watch their spend.""The Bottom LineAll three companies recognize the fact that this is an important time to bring new customers on board because of the cost efficiencies that the cloud can provide in times of macro uncertainty. The idea seems to be to get more customers in the door, even if they don't commit to long-term agreements. There is a tremendous amount of confidence in the longer-term potential of the cloud because businesses and governments are still in the early days of public cloud adoption. This confidence is reflected in the significant capital they are investing in the business.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

47,e180ffa8-095b-373c-8c03-baf016c68201,MSFT,2022-10-31,Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) investors will be pleased with their strong 198% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsofts-nasdaq-msft-investors-pleased-110033164.html,1667214033,STORY,['MSFT'],"[While Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 15% in the last quarter. But in stark contrast, the returns over the last half decade have impressed. We think most investors would be happy with the 180% return, over that period. To some, the recent pullback wouldn't be surprising after such a fast rise. Ultimately business performance will determine whether the stock price continues the positive long term trend. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 29% drop, in the last year.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Microsoft To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Microsoft managed to grow its earnings per share at 22% a year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 23% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on Microsoft's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Microsoft, it has a TSR of 198% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Microsoft shareholders are down 28% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 21%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 24% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Microsoft is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Microsoft is not the only stock insiders are buying.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best November Dividend Stocks To Buy.Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF) are some of the most prominent companies that are making dividend payments in November 2022.Whether you’re looking to start building out a portfolio of dividend stocks, or fill in some of the monthly gaps in your dividend stocks collection so you have a steady stream of income from them, November is a good month to target.Some of the best dividend stocks on the market, which boast attractive yields and strong dividend growth rates are paying out in November. All of the stocks on this list make their payments in the second half of the month and have yet to pass their ex-dividend date (as of the time of publication), so it’s not too late to add any of them to your portfolio and collect their November dividend payments.Among the top November dividend stocks are more than a dozen Dividend Aristocrats, which are companies that have increased their annual dividend payouts for at least 25 straight years. A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) are just some of the Dividend Aristocrats paying out this month.There are even some Dividend Kings (50+ consecutive years of annual dividend increases) paying out this month that make great additions to any dividend portfolio. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) feature prominently on that list. However, all of the aforementioned stocks have passed their ex-dividend date (the date before which one must be a shareholder of the company to receive its next dividend payment), so none of those companies are included in this list.Even without those major dividend players, the list of best dividend stocks that pay in November isn’t left wanting for strong dividend stocks, as evidenced by the following list. In it, we’ll examine each stock’s dividend history, payout and ex-dividend dates, payout ratio, and other factors so you can make an informed decision about whether or not the stock in question would make a good addition to your dividend portfolio.Story continues10 Best November Dividend Stocks To BuyPhoto by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/Our MethodologyThe following November dividend stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.10 Best November Dividend Stocks To Buy10. Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE:ALX)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 9 November 18 Dividend Payout: $4.50 CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) are some of the major November dividend payers to consider for your portfolio. A lesser known company that also makes its next dividend payment this month is REIT Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE:ALX).Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE:ALX) has paid out dividends for ten straight years, though its quarterly dividend payments have been stalled at $4.50 for the last five years. Nonetheless, the stock boasts an attractive dividend yield of 7.81%. The ex-dividend date for the next payment is November 4.In addition to its dividend payments, there are other potential ways for investors to make money off ALX, as the company reportedly has an interested buyer willing to take it private at a significant premium according to an open letter to ALX shareholders issued by Lionbridge Capital in July. In the letter, Lionbridge urged the company to consider several other changes that could unlock shareholder value, believing that mismanagement has left the company severely underrated by the market. It estimates Alexander’s Net Asset Value to be over $400 per share, more than 70% greater than the stock’s current price.Hedge fund ownership of Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE:ALX) ticked up in Q2 but is down by 31% from its peak reached in the second quarter of 2021. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management and Paul Tudor Jones’ Tudor Investment Corp added ALX to their 13F portfolios during Q2, while Frank Brosens’ Taconic Capital held the largest stake in the company consisting of 142,300 shares.9. Comfort Systems USA, Inc. (NYSE:FIX)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 14 November 28 Dividend Payout: $0.15 Comfort Systems USA, Inc. (NYSE:FIX) has grown its dividend at an impressive CAGR of 13.2% over the past five years, though the stock’s yield is still rather light at just 0.49%. Nonetheless, with a payout ratio of just 11%, this is a dividend stock that could continue to grow at a steady rate for years to come. The ex-dividend date for the company’s next payment is November 16. That payment will be one cent higher for the second time this year and 36% higher than it was two years ago.Comfort Systems USA, Inc. (NYSE:FIX), which provides installation, maintenance, and repair services for heating, air conditioning, and ventilation systems, had a strong Q3 despite warning of cost and input challenges back in July. The company pulled in $1.71 in EPS, which topped estimates by 25%, while its $1.12 billion in revenue also beat estimates. Comfort Systems also has a robust backlog, which should ensure continued organic growth in the quarters to come.The number of smart money managers with long positions in Comfort Systems USA, Inc. (NYSE:FIX) fell by 44% between the middle of 2021 and the end of March 2022, hitting its lowest point in five years. Hedge fund ownership of the stock remained flat during Q2. Chuck Royce’s Royce &amp; Associates maintained the largest position in FIX for the tenth straight quarter, owning 383,851 shares as of June 30 after nearly doubling the size of position during the quarter.8. Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 17 November 23 Dividend Payout: $0.50 There’s been a lot of activity surrounding Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO)’s dividend payments in recent quarters. The company made six consecutive quarterly hikes to its dividend beginning in Q3 2020, and then raised it by another 25% in the second quarter of this year. However, it’s since had to cut its dividend in each of the last two quarters, paring its payout back to Q4 2020 levels. The stock, which has an ex-dividend date of November 8, still has an attractive yield of over 4%.Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO)’s Q2 revenue and EPS took major year-over-year hits, falling to $2.31 billion and $0.56 respectively from $2.9 billion and $1.21 a year earlier, as demand weakens. With Goldman Sachs predicting copper scarcity in the coming years, the company is well positioned to capitalize given its advantageous cost/curve position and sizable exposure to copper.Hedge fund ownership of Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO) fell by 38% between Q1 2021 and Q2 2022, but did tick up slightly during the second quarter. Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake in SCCO, while fellow billionaire Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group added SCCO to its 13F portfolio during the quarter.7. Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 26 November 28 Dividend Payout: $0.28 Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) has nearly tripled the size of its quarterly dividend over the past five years, growing it at an impressive CAGR of 21.9% during that time. That rapid growth has lifted its yield to a respectable 2.38%, and with a payout ratio of just 32%, that yield could push towards 3% in the coming years. The company’s next dividend payment has an ex-dividend date of November 11.A manufacturer of a wide range of home improvement products, Masco did run into some difficulty in Q3, missing its earnings guidance and cutting its full-year outlook, citing weakness in its plumbing and paints segments. The company could face continued pressure throughout next year amid a weakened housing market, but has a strong balance sheet and cash flows that should see it through the period without any risk to its dividend.Hedge funds have been bailing on Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) this year, as there’s been a 36% decline in the number of funds long MAS through the end of June. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Greg Poole’s Echo Street Capital Management were a couple of the funds to unload their stakes in Masco during the second quarter.On the other hand, Oakmark Fund believes the market is undervaluing Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS), as detailed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“We believe the market is failing to properly reward Masco (NYSE:MAS), a leader in home improvement products, for the significant upgrade of its business mix over the past decade. Having previously sold its more cyclical, lower return businesses, such as insulation, windows, and cabinets, what remains are some of the strongest and most recognizable brands in the industry. The company’s portfolio of products-primarily coatings (Behr) and plumbing fixtures (Delta, Hansgrohe)-are more resilient, lower ticket, and higher margin categories. Both segments compete within heavily consolidated industries, exhibit strong pricing power and skew meaningfully toward the less cyclical repair and remodel market. Despite its greatly improved business mix, Masco trades for just 10x next year’s expected earnings, which is a discount to historical levels and comfortably below a market multiple. We believe this dislocation presents an attractive opportunity to invest in a well-managed, high-quality portfolio in a sector that’s currently out of favor.”6. KB Home (NYSE:KBH)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 29 November 23 Dividend Payout: $0.15 Another home-related stock closes out the first half of this list in the form of homebuilder KB Home (NYSE:KBH), whose dividend payments have flat lined this year after rising by 400% between 2018 and 2021. The company has a miniscule payout ratio of just 7%, which is impressive for a stock with a decent yield of just over 2%. The ex-dividend date to collect KBH’s next dividend payment is November 9.With home prices deteriorating, particularly in KB Home (NYSE:KBH)’s core West Coast markets, analysts believe the company may need to sacrifice some of its margins to continue driving sales. RBC Capital analyst Mike Dahl slashed his FY23 EPS forecast for the company to $6.97 from $9.57 in September, but noted that near-term risks are already priced into the stock given that it trades at just 0.7x tangible book value.Hedge fund ownership of KB Home (NYSE:KBH) shot up by 38% during the fourth quarter of 2021 to hit an all-time high, but had since fallen back slightly. Charles Clough’s Clough Capital Partners and Mark Coe’s Intrinsic Edge Capital were some of the funds to add KBH stakes to their portfolios last Q4. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held the largest position in KB Home on June 30, owning 2.43 million shares.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) are among the top dividend stocks to buy in November, check out the details through the link below. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best November Dividend Stocks To Buy. Suggested articles:15 Biggest Cell Phone Companies in the World10 Largest Gas Station Chains in the US10 S&amp;P 500 Stocks with Upside Potential Disclosure: None. 10 Best November Dividend Stocks To Buy is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

The report cited some Starbucks baristas that the company’s extension of new benefits to nonunion stores has deterred other employees from unionizing, as has the company’s dismissals of some pro-union workers this year.In response to the unionization trend, Starbucks said it would invest millions of dollars in addressing employee complaints.""It gets to a point where it feels like you are trudging through mud to get to a finish line, and it takes a special person to do that,” the report quoted Richard Minter, national organizing director of Workers United.Also Read: Starbucks Plunges As Xi Jinping Consolidates Power: Here's What's Going OnPrice Action: SBUX shares are trading lower by 0.90% at $86.32 in premarket on the last check Monday.Photo Via Wikimedia CommonsSee more from BenzingaStellantis' China JV GAC-FCA To File For BankruptcyThis Analyst Expects Solid October Sales Report From CostcoEdward Snowden Says 'We Are All Going To Be Billionaires' But...Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

52,93020fa4-ebfa-3af4-b0f0-895950d78d3e,SBUX,2022-10-31,20 Most Admired Companies in the World in 2022,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-most-admired-companies-world-203040991.html,1667161840,STORY,"['NFLX', 'DIS', 'SBUX', 'PFE', 'AMZN', 'JNJ', 'DAL', 'FDX', 'WMT', 'TGT', 'BRK-B', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'COST']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 20 most admired companies in the world in 2022. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most admired companies in the world.It seems that most companies are facing a reckoning right now. While corporations have often been lambasted because of their capitalistic nature and lack of regard for employees and the general population in lieu of massive profits, the protests against companies seem to have only amplified since the pandemic began. While the Occupy Wall Street protests initially began as a way to oppose the level of money involved in politics and income inequality, with references to the elite 1% holding much of the country's wealth, their ire soon turned to banks and major corporations. However, the protests did not sustain and, after beginning in 2011, faded by 2012.After the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the world, lockdowns were imposed in most countries around the globe and economies came to a standstill, with most business either shut down, or running on a vastly reduced scale. This led to companies laying of millions across the globe, with the hardest hit industries such as the travel industry laying off the most people, with major companies such as The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL) and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) each laying off thousands of employees. Many companies also considered this an opportunity to lay off employees and reduce costs despite record profits, with World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:WWE) one of such companies, laying off dozens of talent despite being at its most profitable.Most Admired Companies in the world in 2022However, the pandemic provided an opportunity to employees which resulted in an improvement in work-life balance in their lives. Many are now refusing to work unless it's completely remote, citing the reduced expenses because of not having to commute, not to mention the invaluable time saved. As the economy rebounded, many businesses realized that they needed more employees to run operations smoothly, only for employees to have realized their self-worth in the meanwhile and not being willing to go back to work under the same conditions that they'd been subjected to earlier. This has also led to the Great Resignation, an ongoing economic trend where employees are resigning en masse, starting in April 2021, where in the United States, more than four million resigned from their jobs, followed by 3.9 million resignations in June 2021.Story continuesThe demand of the employees is similar regardless of class, background and level of experience; better work-life balance, more flexibility and better compensation. According to a study carried out by PwC, 65% of employees said they were looking for a new job while 88% of executives admitted that the rate of turnover in their companies was higher than normal.Companies seem to be coming to the realization that the days of employee loyalty is over, as it should be, and that they need to do a lot more to improve relations between executives and employees. Further, companies are also significantly under fire due to their contributions to climate change. A 2017 report by the Guardian stated that just 100 companies across the world were responsible for 71% of global emissions, which the companies try to cover by attempting to transfer the onus to regular people, as if they're not to blame. In an effort to improve their image, many companies, including of course the most admired companies in the world, are attempting to rectify their contribution to climate change, often pledging to become carbon neutral or at least significantly reducing their carbon emissions over the next decade or two.The most admired companies in the world are also some of the most recognizable. These companies have long realized the importance of retaining and attracting top talent and creating and maintaining and image that has won them plaudits all over the world. We have used Fortune's annual ranking based on corporate reputation for 2021, with the rankings determined from responses from more than 3,700 executives, directors and analysts. These rankings don't insinuate that these are the most ethical companies free from any misdeeds plaguing them, which we'll cover more when talking about each company, but are simply an indication of the reputation and standing of the company. This is why some medical companies have climbed within the list since they've been on the forefront in the battle against the deadliest pandemic in a century. However, while we've chosen the top 20 from Fortune, we have then checked Google Trend statistics for each company. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the most admired companies in the world, starting with number 20:20. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was one of the first pharmaceutical companies to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, which has been essential and integral in allowing the resumption of normal activities across the globe. While Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was nowhere near the top 20 in the previous year, now it kicks off the list of most admired companies in the world as it led by example, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has perhaps been integral in dissipating some of the mistrust the general population has towards the biggest pharmaceutical companies.19. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the biggest conglomerates in the United States. While Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been much maligned for cancer causing talc-based baby powder and was ordered to pay $2.1 billion to the plaintiffs, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was one of the few companies to develop a valid Covid-19 vaccine, which was instrumental in curbing the pandemic.18. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is famous for selling quality items for lower prices and has gained admirers for its focus on sustainability and environmental, social and governance issues by setting measurable goals with the aim to to improve consistently. One of Target Corporation's (NYSE:TGT) recent initiatives includes investing $100 million into Black communities in an effort to combat racism and racial inequality.17. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) being considered an admired company will definitely rankle some feathers. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has faced a ton of lawsuits based on poor working conditions, low wages, poor health care and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) being involved in antiunion activities. The fact that it's still in this list speaks volumes about the disconnect between executives and average employees.16. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Topping the list of the most admired companies in the world for Fortune is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), though it only made it to 16th position in our list.  Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is constantly recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the world as well. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has topped every category used by Fortune in its determination including use of corporate assets, innovation, social responsibility, financial soundness, quality of management, quality of products and services and global competitiveness.15. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A)Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), run by the legendary Warren Buffett, is admired primarily because of the way its been run by the famous investor. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A) is the largest financial services company in the world by revenue.14. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the most well-known companies in the world. In fact, odds are if you're reading this article on a laptop, you're using Microsoft Windows to run your computer! Regularly rated as one of the best places to work at, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) encourages creativity and is held in high regards by its employees.13. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is one of the biggest chains in the world, with more than 33,000 stores globally. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) also pays full time tuition for all eligible partners in Arizona State University's online program, with more than 1,000 Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) partners having graduated through the program. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) aims to have more than 25,000 partners obtain a degree from ASU by 2025. However, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has also opposed the formation of unions.12. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)The most admired delivery company in the world, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has been a part of Fortune's list for at least 22 years. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has more than 850,000 employees worldwide, and despite allegations of distributed substances and narcotics not to mention allegations of tax evasion, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has still been able to maintain its view as an admired company.11. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the few major retailers which has actually been praised by current and ex-employees. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) may not have unions in the majority of locations but 15,000 employees are union members. Further, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has continuously raised the minimum wage of its workers, which is now $16 an hour.10. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the most popular streaming platforms in the world today, with more than 220 million subscribers across the globe. While making the list of the most admired companies in the world, it is unlikely that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be maintaining its ranking considering its poor performance recently losing subscribers while letting go 300 employees in June. Netflix Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has also seen its share price decline by 61% YTD in 2022.9. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) being among the most admired companies in the world is definitely going to be controversial, what with the internet being full of stories of the way Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) mistreats its workers, busts unions and tries to stifle worker rights in multiple instances, the truth is that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is still really admired because of its innovation for customers, support for communities and commitment to the environment. Of course, it's worth noting that it is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) itself which has mentioned the above reasons.8. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)One of the biggest sports goods manufacturers in the world, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has an incredibly strong brand reputation and brand loyalty, which has served it through decades. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)  is also famous for its innovation and creativity, though it does need to do more in terms of social responsibility.7. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL)While Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) infamously became the face of poor customer service after it dragged off a doctor from the plane in 2017, but to its credit, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) did reviews its policies after the incident to improve upon services provided.6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is the most admired media and entertainment company in the world. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has been admired in several areas including people management, use of corporate assets, social responsibility, quality of management and quality of products and services. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) seems to have a new lease on life with the launch of Disney+, which has been a massive success so far.Please continue to see the 5 Most Admired Companies in the World.Suggested articles:15 Most Valuable British Companies10 Biggest Publishing Companies in the World 15 Most Valuable Indian Tech Companies In The WorldDisclosure: None. 20 most admired companies in the world is originally published at Insider Monkey. ]"

(NYSE:PM) stock at high prices would have gotten insiders a handsome reward,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/selling-us-17m-worth-philip-110049595.html,1667214049,STORY,['PM'],"[Despite the fact that Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) stock rose 7.0% last week, insiders who sold US$17m worth of stock in the previous 12 months are likely to be better off. Selling at an average price of US$111, which is higher than the current price might have been the right call as holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International Philip Morris International Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Chairman of the Board, Andre Calantzopoulos, sold US$8.3m worth of shares at a price of US$111 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$92.53. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.In the last year Philip Morris International insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does Philip Morris International Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Philip Morris International insiders own about US$237m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Philip Morris International Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Philip Morris International insiders selling. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that Philip Morris International has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.But note: Philip Morris International may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NYSE:GS) institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/following-15-decline-over-last-140056437.html,1667138456,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[To get a sense of who is truly in control of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 74% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Last week's US$5.4b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 15% losses.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Goldman Sachs Group. See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Goldman Sachs Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Goldman Sachs Group. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Goldman Sachs Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Goldman Sachs Group. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.4% of shares outstanding. With 7.1% and 6.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Story continuesResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Goldman Sachs GroupThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$563m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 26% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Goldman Sachs Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

In addition to GAAP measures, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to focus on the factors the company believes are pertinent to the daily management of our operations. The constant currency growth measures adjust for the impact of exchange rates and are calculated using average exchange rates during the comparable period in 2021.Global Payments also has provided supplemental non-GAAP information to reflect the pending divestiture of the consumer portion of the Consumer Solutions segment.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Schlumberger The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SchlumbergerThe Executive Vice President of Geographies, Khaled Al Mogharbel, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$39.64 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$50.45. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 12% of Khaled Al Mogharbel's holding.In the last year Schlumberger insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of SchlumbergerMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Schlumberger insiders own about US$159m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Schlumberger Insiders?The fact that there have been no Schlumberger insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Schlumberger insiders selling. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Schlumberger that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Government policy impacts the economy. Uncertain government policy implies an uncertain economic direction. Markets hate uncertainty.There’s even more uncertainty this year, given the wide divergence between the parties, and their voters. What might happen under a Republican Congress is different from what might happen under a Democratic Congress.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe best thing for an investor to do in these circumstances is to “election proof” your portfolio by avoiding those stocks, and sectors, that are most subject to uncertainty. The next best thing is to place a financial bet on the outcome. If you believe in the Republicans, avoid those sectors that would grow under Democrats, and vice versa.Right now, odds favor a Republican takeover of the House but the Senate is up in the air. If this comes to pass then gridlock among the branches of government will likely shift public policy to the right. But what if the experts are wrong? In that case, it’s Democrats who may be turning against their political enemies, and they have many in the business world.If Democrats win, here are three stocks to avoid.SymbolCompanyPriceSLBSLB$52.80COINCoinbase Global$74.45PFEPfizer$45.75SLB (SLB)slb stockSource: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.comRight now analysts are very high on SLB (NYSE:SLB), which is the rebranding of Schlumberger.SLB is the dominant name in oilfield services and has been for decades. While management is trying to rebrand it as low carbon, its money still comes from drilling for, pumping, and managing oil and gas. My misgivings here are shared with other oilpatch names like Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), BakerHughes (NYSE:BKR), and Transocean (NYSE:RIG).Despite any rebranding, it’s oil that has the analysts excited about SLB. Prices have doubled in a year, and the Biden administration has offered a profitable floor of $70/barrel as it depletes the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This has made 2022 a very good year for SLB. Earnings of $907 million, 63 cents/share, were up 75% over the previous year. Revenue of nearly $7.5 billion was up 28%.Story continuesWhat really attracted the SLB bulls was where the growth came from: Its international business. As a result, all 16 analysts following SLB at Tipranks now say buy it. After years of going nowhere, still selling below its price of 10 years ago, SLB is up 75% this year and heading higher. Zack’s calls it a “top momentum stock for the long term.”Why not buy it? Well, I remember when everyone said to buy Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Fashions change. The next move from oil will be the last one. That’s why SLB calls itself a “technology company,” highlighting its business in reducing gas flares, capturing carbon, and reducing customers’ “carbon footprint.” SLB now says it wants to lead in clean hydrogen and lithium production.This will require a complete transformation of the business, the kind Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is going through. You may like the destination, but until then they’re taking your money for a ride. Once the war in Ukraine ends, look for oil and gas prices to plummet, and SLB’s business with it.They say they’re ready. But the stock price isn’t. SLB is definitely a stock to avoid if a “blue wave” takes Congress.Coinbase (COIN)COIN stock Coinbase logo on screen with Bitcoin coinsSource: 24K-Production / Shutterstock.comCoinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) has lost 70% of its value this year amid the crypto crash, one that has Bitcoin (BTC-USD) selling for half what it did in January.My misgivings here are shared with other companies in the crypto space, from Bitcoin holders like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), to miners like Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT), and even exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like Cathie Wood’s ARK Fintech Innovation Fund (NASDAQ:ARKF). Years of covering the space have made me a crypto skeptic. I ask, what’s the business model, and how can crypto do that better than existing solutions? When I hear silence, or word salad, I walk away.Coinbase will report its third-quarter results on Nov. 3. Analysts are positioned for bad news, after a loss of nearly $1.1 billion, $4.98/share, during the second quarter. Coinbase recorded “restructuring charges” of $42 million during the quarter, to handle layoffs, but still handed out $391 million in “stock based compensation,” watering down the stake of investors.Bulls like Cathie Woods believe the worst is over, and they’re buying. So are nine of the 20 analysts following Coinbase at Tipranks.But Coinbase is fighting with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the agency’s efforts to define crypto as a security, subject to strict regulation. It is playing political hardball, creating its own think tank to advocate its position.If Republicans sweep the midterms, Coinbase stock is going to rise. If Democrats hold their own, it’s going to face a harder road. You may want to take that bet. But I prefer short odds, and a coin flip isn’t short odds.Pfizer (PFE)blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stockSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comA year ago, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) CEO Albert Bourla was my “executive of the year” for his management of the Covid-19 pandemic. Since then, PFE stock is down 10%.I still think Bourla is an outstanding executive. Pfizer next reports on Nov. 1. Analysts expect earnings of $1.47/share. The second quarter saw adjusted earnings of $2.04/share on revenue of $27.7 billion.The most important action the Biden administration has taken regarding drugs was a provision of the Inflation Reduction Act allowing Medicare to negotiate on drug prices. These are still the early days of the policy, and a Republican Congress could reverse it. It’s still limited in scope. A $35/month price cap for Medicare patients on insulin barely made it through.But the price cap will accelerate the move of diabetic patients from private care to Medicare. If negotiations continue, private insurers like CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) will demand the same thing.It’s a revolution that’s very bad for Pfizer, but also for competitors like Merck (NYSE:MRK), Abbvie (NASDAQ:ABBV), and Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN). U.S. patients have long subsidized the industry’s costs and profits. Even when there are multiple drugs for a condition, prices for all of them remain elevated. If this is allowed to change, the industry will have to adjust. It’s why the price-to-earnings ratio for Pfizer is already just nine. But that’s based on this year’s stellar earnings. The future may not be as bright if a Democratic government gets its way.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held a long position in INTC.

The median Canadian Pension Plan returned 0.76% for the quarter and -14.75% year to date as of September 30, 2022.The third quarter was marked by increased market volatility triggered predominantly by persistent inflation and the willingness of monetary policymakers to bring it under control. The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) continued its unwavering journey to stem inflation with aggressive hikes to its Federal Funds Target Rate. In turn, the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to other global currencies, reinforcing its status as the ""safe haven"" asset.Major central banks across the globe followed a similar tightening direction, spurring fears the battle against inflation would prompt an economic recession. The UK government’s announcement of an unfunded fiscal package, subsequently countered by Bank of England intervention, put further pressure on global bond markets late in the quarter. Despite the restrictive monetary policy environment, North American equity markets held up reasonably well, led by the U.S., relative to global peers. The overall Canadian bond universe closed the quarter with a small gain.""Measures taken by central banks to restore equilibrium across the global economy cascaded down to the investments of Canadian pension plans. Despite the ebb and flow of volatility, pension plan sponsors have demonstrated resilience and adapted well through ever-changing cycles, as witnessed this quarter by the positive return of the median pension plan against a backdrop of monetary tightening,"" said Katie Pries, President and CEO of Northern Trust Canada.The Northern Trust Canada Universe tracks the performance of Canadian institutional defined benefit plans that subscribe to performance measurement services as part of Northern Trust’s asset service offerings.Story continuesDuring the quarter, corporate valuations were challenged with headwinds of rising interest rates and the potential for a slower economic growth environment. Bond prices continued to adjust throughout the period as aggressive interest rate hikes intensified around the globe. In this environment, Canadian bonds delivered modest gains while equity markets declined, except for the U.S. market.Canadian equities, as measured by the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index, declined -1.4% for the quarter. Consumer Discretionary and Industrial sectors were the top performers while Communication Services, Health Care and Real Estate sectors posted the weakest results.U.S. equities, as measured by the S&amp;P 500 Index, produced a gain of 1.3% in CAD for the quarter. The strengthening U.S. dollar was a strong contributor to the positive return for the period. Consumer Discretionary and Energy sectors witnessed the strongest performance, while the largest decliners for the period were Communication Services and the Real Estate sectors.International developed markets, as measured by the MSCI EAFE Index, returned -3.4% in CAD for the quarter. All sectors contracted during the period, except for the Energy sector, which earned a positive return over the quarter.The MSCI Emerging Markets Index declined -5.6% in CAD for the quarter. Energy and Utilities were the top performing sectors, while Communication Services, Real Estate and Consumer Discretionary sectors witnessed the sharpest declines.The Canadian economy continued to witness the impact of supply constraints, the invasion of Ukraine and strong domestic demand as evidenced by the September inflation reading of 6.9% year over year. The unemployment rate nudged up to 5.2% in September from the record low of 4.9% observed in the month of July. During the quarter, the Canadian dollar gave up ground relative to the U.S. dollar, given expectations for interest rates and the decline in commodity prices.The U.S. economy continued to witness job growth as 263,000 non-farm payroll jobs were added in the month of September, bringing the unemployment rate to 3.5%. Inflation declined from a peak of 9.1% in June but remained elevated, with the August CPI reading of 8.3% year over year. The Fed, in its effort to curb inflation, hiked its benchmark overnight rate by 150 basis points in total over the quarter, bringing the target range to 3.0% to 3.25%.International markets continued to struggle with higher food and energy prices in addition to the ongoing European energy crisis. Inflation readings remained elevated in Europe, resulting in the Bank of England (BoE) and the European Central Bank (ECB) raising their overnight interest rates by a total of 100 and 125 basis points respectively. In addition, the UK elected a new Prime Minister, who late in the quarter announced a significant unfunded fiscal package. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) maintained its accommodative monetary policy during the quarter.Emerging markets lagged developed markets during the quarter, as global central banks continued their tightening path. India increased its policy repo rate by 1%, to 5.9%, while Brazil witnessed one rate hike over the quarter bringing their target rate to 13.75%. Despite ongoing restrictive global monetary policy, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) kept its lending rates relatively steady during the period.The Bank of Canada (BoC) increased the overnight interest rate in total of 1.75% during the quarter, bringing its policy interest rate to 3.25%. The policy rate is expected to rise further in order to achieve the BoC’s inflation target of 2%.The Canadian Fixed Income market, as measured by the FTSE Canada Universe Bond Index, advanced 0.5% for the quarter. Provincial bonds outperformed Corporate and Federal bonds, while long-term bonds outpaced both short-term and medium-term bonds.About Northern TrustNorthern Trust Corporation (Nasdaq: NTRS) is a leading provider of wealth management, asset servicing, asset management and banking to corporations, institutions, affluent families and individuals.

If you want to explore similar companies, you can also take a look at Top 5 Life Insurance Companies In The World.Life Insurance Industry: An AnalysisThe life insurance industry is a vital part of the financial services sector in the United States. It helps provide financial security for families in the event of the death of a breadwinner, and also offers a variety of other products and services to meet the needs of policyholders. The industry is highly competitive, with a large number of companies offering a variety of products. Life insurance companies must be licensed in every state in which they do business, and are subject to regulation by the state insurance commissioner. The life insurance industry has undergone a number of changes in recent years, including the introduction of new products, the consolidation of companies, and the emergence of new distribution channels.According to statistics from McKinsey, life insurance made up 45% of global premiums in 2019, up 4.4% from its share in 2018. Global life insurance gross premiums went up by 4% in 2019, in line with the growth rate in 2017 and 2018. Developing economies in the Asia Pacific region exhibited the fastest growth in the world, and grew by 10% in 2019. The pandemic drove the life insurance premiums growth in 2020 and 2021, however, growth attributed to the pandemic appears to be slowing down according to the 2023 insurance outlook by Deloitte. Deloitte analysts expect a minor contraction in global premiums growth in 2022, 0.2%, partly due to rising interest rates and surging inflation. However, Deloitte forecasts that global premiums growth will rebound in 2023 and record a 1.9% increase in the year across emerging markets as the inflation situation cools down and economic conditions improve. Deloitte expects life insurance premiums to fall across North America, Europe, and China in 2022. However, the firm sees emerging markets, excluding China, registering a positive growth print of 3.5% for premiums in 2022, led by India recording a 6% increase in life insurance premiums for the year.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most admired companies in the world.It seems that most companies are facing a reckoning right now. While corporations have often been lambasted because of their capitalistic nature and lack of regard for employees and the general population in lieu of massive profits, the protests against companies seem to have only amplified since the pandemic began. While the Occupy Wall Street protests initially began as a way to oppose the level of money involved in politics and income inequality, with references to the elite 1% holding much of the country's wealth, their ire soon turned to banks and major corporations. However, the protests did not sustain and, after beginning in 2011, faded by 2012.After the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the world, lockdowns were imposed in most countries around the globe and economies came to a standstill, with most business either shut down, or running on a vastly reduced scale. This led to companies laying of millions across the globe, with the hardest hit industries such as the travel industry laying off the most people, with major companies such as The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL) and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) each laying off thousands of employees. Many companies also considered this an opportunity to lay off employees and reduce costs despite record profits, with World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:WWE) one of such companies, laying off dozens of talent despite being at its most profitable.Most Admired Companies in the world in 2022However, the pandemic provided an opportunity to employees which resulted in an improvement in work-life balance in their lives. Many are now refusing to work unless it's completely remote, citing the reduced expenses because of not having to commute, not to mention the invaluable time saved. As the economy rebounded, many businesses realized that they needed more employees to run operations smoothly, only for employees to have realized their self-worth in the meanwhile and not being willing to go back to work under the same conditions that they'd been subjected to earlier. This has also led to the Great Resignation, an ongoing economic trend where employees are resigning en masse, starting in April 2021, where in the United States, more than four million resigned from their jobs, followed by 3.9 million resignations in June 2021.Story continuesThe demand of the employees is similar regardless of class, background and level of experience; better work-life balance, more flexibility and better compensation. According to a study carried out by PwC, 65% of employees said they were looking for a new job while 88% of executives admitted that the rate of turnover in their companies was higher than normal.Companies seem to be coming to the realization that the days of employee loyalty is over, as it should be, and that they need to do a lot more to improve relations between executives and employees. Further, companies are also significantly under fire due to their contributions to climate change. A 2017 report by the Guardian stated that just 100 companies across the world were responsible for 71% of global emissions, which the companies try to cover by attempting to transfer the onus to regular people, as if they're not to blame. In an effort to improve their image, many companies, including of course the most admired companies in the world, are attempting to rectify their contribution to climate change, often pledging to become carbon neutral or at least significantly reducing their carbon emissions over the next decade or two.The most admired companies in the world are also some of the most recognizable. These companies have long realized the importance of retaining and attracting top talent and creating and maintaining and image that has won them plaudits all over the world. We have used Fortune's annual ranking based on corporate reputation for 2021, with the rankings determined from responses from more than 3,700 executives, directors and analysts. These rankings don't insinuate that these are the most ethical companies free from any misdeeds plaguing them, which we'll cover more when talking about each company, but are simply an indication of the reputation and standing of the company. This is why some medical companies have climbed within the list since they've been on the forefront in the battle against the deadliest pandemic in a century. However, while we've chosen the top 20 from Fortune, we have then checked Google Trend statistics for each company. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the most admired companies in the world, starting with number 20:20. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was one of the first pharmaceutical companies to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, which has been essential and integral in allowing the resumption of normal activities across the globe. While Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was nowhere near the top 20 in the previous year, now it kicks off the list of most admired companies in the world as it led by example, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has perhaps been integral in dissipating some of the mistrust the general population has towards the biggest pharmaceutical companies.19. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the biggest conglomerates in the United States. While Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been much maligned for cancer causing talc-based baby powder and was ordered to pay $2.1 billion to the plaintiffs, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was one of the few companies to develop a valid Covid-19 vaccine, which was instrumental in curbing the pandemic.18. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is famous for selling quality items for lower prices and has gained admirers for its focus on sustainability and environmental, social and governance issues by setting measurable goals with the aim to to improve consistently. One of Target Corporation's (NYSE:TGT) recent initiatives includes investing $100 million into Black communities in an effort to combat racism and racial inequality.17. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) being considered an admired company will definitely rankle some feathers. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has faced a ton of lawsuits based on poor working conditions, low wages, poor health care and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) being involved in antiunion activities. The fact that it's still in this list speaks volumes about the disconnect between executives and average employees.16. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Topping the list of the most admired companies in the world for Fortune is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), though it only made it to 16th position in our list.  Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is constantly recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the world as well. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has topped every category used by Fortune in its determination including use of corporate assets, innovation, social responsibility, financial soundness, quality of management, quality of products and services and global competitiveness.15. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A)Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), run by the legendary Warren Buffett, is admired primarily because of the way its been run by the famous investor. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A) is the largest financial services company in the world by revenue.14. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the most well-known companies in the world. In fact, odds are if you're reading this article on a laptop, you're using Microsoft Windows to run your computer! Regularly rated as one of the best places to work at, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) encourages creativity and is held in high regards by its employees.13. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is one of the biggest chains in the world, with more than 33,000 stores globally. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) also pays full time tuition for all eligible partners in Arizona State University's online program, with more than 1,000 Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) partners having graduated through the program. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) aims to have more than 25,000 partners obtain a degree from ASU by 2025. However, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has also opposed the formation of unions.12. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)The most admired delivery company in the world, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has been a part of Fortune's list for at least 22 years. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has more than 850,000 employees worldwide, and despite allegations of distributed substances and narcotics not to mention allegations of tax evasion, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has still been able to maintain its view as an admired company.11. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the few major retailers which has actually been praised by current and ex-employees. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) may not have unions in the majority of locations but 15,000 employees are union members. Further, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has continuously raised the minimum wage of its workers, which is now $16 an hour.10. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the most popular streaming platforms in the world today, with more than 220 million subscribers across the globe. While making the list of the most admired companies in the world, it is unlikely that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be maintaining its ranking considering its poor performance recently losing subscribers while letting go 300 employees in June. Netflix Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has also seen its share price decline by 61% YTD in 2022.9. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) being among the most admired companies in the world is definitely going to be controversial, what with the internet being full of stories of the way Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) mistreats its workers, busts unions and tries to stifle worker rights in multiple instances, the truth is that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is still really admired because of its innovation for customers, support for communities and commitment to the environment. Of course, it's worth noting that it is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) itself which has mentioned the above reasons.8. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)One of the biggest sports goods manufacturers in the world, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has an incredibly strong brand reputation and brand loyalty, which has served it through decades. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)  is also famous for its innovation and creativity, though it does need to do more in terms of social responsibility.7. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL)While Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) infamously became the face of poor customer service after it dragged off a doctor from the plane in 2017, but to its credit, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) did reviews its policies after the incident to improve upon services provided.6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is the most admired media and entertainment company in the world. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has been admired in several areas including people management, use of corporate assets, social responsibility, quality of management and quality of products and services. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) seems to have a new lease on life with the launch of Disney+, which has been a massive success so far.Please continue to see the 5 Most Admired Companies in the World.Suggested articles:15 Most Valuable British Companies10 Biggest Publishing Companies in the World 15 Most Valuable Indian Tech Companies In The WorldDisclosure: None. 20 most admired companies in the world is originally published at Insider Monkey. ]"

Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. Particularly, we will be paying attention to TJX Companies'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for TJX Companies How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for TJX Companies is:62% = US$3.4b ÷ US$5.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.62 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of TJX Companies' Earnings Growth And 62% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that TJX Companies has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 30% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Needless to say, we are quite surprised to see that TJX Companies' net income shrunk at a rate of 2.6% over the past five years. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesHowever, when we compared TJX Companies' growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 32% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is TJX fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is TJX Companies Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Looking at its three-year median payout ratio of 38% (or a retention ratio of 62%) which is pretty normal, TJX Companies' declining earnings is rather baffling as one would expect to see a fair bit of growth when a company is retaining a good portion of its profits. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.Additionally, TJX Companies has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 37%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 68%.ConclusionOn the whole, we do feel that TJX Companies has some positive attributes. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

Its operating subsidiaries are: PSEG Power, Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&amp;G) and PSEG Long Island. (PRNewsfoto/PSEG)Ralph LaRossa, PSEG's president and chief executive officer commented, ""We are focused on continuing to grow the company through investments with appropriate risk adjusted returns, and increasing the predictability of our financial results.  Through the first three quarters of 2022, we are on track to deliver on our earnings guidance for the full-year, which we have narrowed to $3.40 to $3.50 per share, affirming our midpoint.  PSE&amp;G's investments in transmission and distribution infrastructure continue to produce rate base growth consistent with our long-term expectations.  Our new Infrastructure Advancement Program, which launches investment in the critical ""Last Mile"" of our distribution system, and the Clean Energy Future investments, are also supporting wide-ranging decarbonization priorities -- driven by energy efficiency, electric vehicles, solar investments, and creating clean energy jobs and training opportunities.  I am also proud to announce that MSCI has raised PSEG's corporate Environmental, Social and Governance rating to AAA from AA, placing us at its highest rating.""""Passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 this past summer will have important revenue visibility and price stabilizing benefits for our 3,770-megawatt nuclear fleet, starting in 2024.  Notably, the federal government has established a decade-long commitment to the preservation of existing nuclear generation through the creation of a production tax credit, which will extend the visibility and stability of cash flows into the next decade.  These incentives will lower customer costs over time and support the continued operation of existing nuclear plants – which are New Jersey's largest carbon-free base load energy resource.""Story continues""Regarding the Ocean Wind 1 project in New Jersey, PSEG's continuation as an equity owner is subject to its final investment decision (FID), which represents the decision to proceed to the construction phase of the project.  We are reviewing our options regarding the status of PSEG's 25% equity investment in the project.  Last week, the BPU completed its review of offshore wind transmission and awarded several on-shore solutions.  PSE&amp;G was awarded $40 million of system upgrade work needed to accommodate the injection of offshore wind generation in central New Jersey.  However, the BPU also indicated an additional solicitation to consider the state's increased offshore wind generation targets.  We remain optimistic that the Coastal Wind Link's emphasis on reliability and resiliency will keep it as a strong contender for any future transmission solicitations to bring regional offshore wind projects on-shore."" LaRossa added.The following table provides a reconciliation of PSEG's Net Income / (Loss) to non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the third quarter.  See the accompanying Attachments for a complete list of items excluded from Net Income / (Loss) in the determination of non-GAAP Operating Earnings.PSEG CONSOLIDATED Third Quarter Comparative Results (unaudited) Income / (Loss) ($ millions)Diluted Earnings(per share)2022202120222021Net Income / (Loss)$114$(1,564)$0.22$(3.10)  Reconciling Items 3152,0590.644.08Non-GAAP Operating Earnings$429$495$0.86$0.98PSEG Fully Diluted Average Shares Outstanding*500M504M*Approximately three million potentially dilutive shares were excluded from fully diluted average shares outstanding used to calculate the diluted GAAP loss per share for the three months ended September 30, 2021 as their impact was antidilutive to GAAP results.

M=Million.CFIO reported a Net Loss of $285 million, or $(0.58) per share for the third quarter of 2022, compared with a Net Loss of $1,953 million, or $(3.87) per share in the third quarter of 2021.  Non-GAAP Operating Earnings for CFIO were $0.15 per share lower than in the third quarter of 2021, driven by lower margin related to the fossil divestiture, lower capacity prices for the remaining nuclear fleet and re-contracting at lower prices.  For the third quarter of 2022, electric gross margin declined by $0.29 per share, which includes re-contracting approximately 8 TWh of nuclear generation at a $3/MWh lower average price.  In addition, higher off-system sales at Gas Operations added $0.01 per share to total gross margin versus the third quarter of 2021.Cost comparisons for the third quarter 2022 improved by $0.09 per share from the year-earlier period, driven by lower O&amp;M, depreciation, and interest expense related to the fossil divestiture.  Taxes and Other were $0.04 per share favorable versus the third quarter of 2021.  During 2021, the Solar Source sale was reflected in June, cessation of fossil depreciation began in August onward, and the retirement of PSEG Power's outstanding debt occurred in October.  Accordingly, the majority of favorable cost comparisons related to the fossil divestiture occurred in the first half of 2022.Nuclear generating output declined slightly to approximately 8 TWh in the third quarter of 2022, reflecting the ramp down of Hope Creek and Peach Bottom 2 into fourth quarter refueling outages.  The capacity factor of the nuclear fleet for the year-to-date period through September 30 was 94.3%.  PSEG forecasts generation output of approximately 7 TWh for the fourth quarter of 2022, and has hedged approximately 95% - 100% of this production at an average price of $27/MWh.  For 2023, PSEG is forecasting nuclear baseload output of 30 to 32 TWh and has hedged 95% - 100% of this output at an average price of $30/MWh.  For 2024, PSEG is forecasting nuclear baseload output of 29 to 31 TWh and has hedged 55% - 60% of this output at an average price of $32/MWh.PSEG Power had net cash collateral postings of $2.2 billion at September 30 related to out-of-the-money hedge positions as a result of higher energy prices during the first three quarters of 2022.  As of October 28, net cash collateral postings were $1.7 billion.  The majority of this collateral relates to hedges in place through the end of 2023 and is expected to be returned as PSEG Power satisfies its obligations under those contracts.The forecast of non-GAAP Operating Earnings for Carbon-Free, Infrastructure &amp; Other is narrowed to $160 million - $180 million (from $170 million - $220 million), reflecting higher interest costs.  The CFIO guidance for 2022 excludes results related to the fossil assets sold in February 2022.PSEG will host a conference call to review its Third Quarter 2022 results with the financial community at 11AM EDT today.  This event can be accessed by visiting https://investor.pseg.com/investor-news-and-events to register.Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) (NYSE: PEG) is a predominantly regulated infrastructure company focused on a clean energy future.

Non-GAAP Operating Earnings exclude the impact of returns (losses) associated with the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT), Mark-to-Market (MTM) accounting and material one-time items.See Attachments 8 and 9 for a complete list of items excluded from Net Income/(Loss) in the determination of non-GAAP Operating Earnings. The presentation of non-GAAP Operating Earnings is intended to complement, and should not be considered an alternative to the presentation of Net Income/(Loss), which is an indicator of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, non-GAAP Operating Earnings as presented in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.Due to the forward looking nature of non-GAAP Operating Earnings guidance, PSEG is unable to reconcile this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management is unable to project certain reconciling items, in particular MTM and NDT gains (losses), for future periods due to market volatility.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain of the matters discussed in this report about our and our subsidiaries' future performance, including, without limitation, future revenues, earnings, strategies, prospects, consequences and all other statements that are not purely historical constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 largest defense contractors in the world in 2022.The world seems to be heading towards a recession, despite being able to seemingly get over a global pandemic due to the early development of a vaccine which saved millions of lives. Inflation has reached recorded highs, and while you may think that most countries would be focused on their own economies and trying to ease the lives of the people living in them, geopolitical upheaval has made a mockery of this belief. In February 2022, Russia initiated an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which eight months later, is still no closer to an end with heavy losses to both sides, though the latter has definitely suffered the worst of it, with thousands of civilians dying and major infrastructure being destroyed by Russia. The West, to counter growing Russian threat, has united against it despite some disagreements, and supplied weapons and aid to Ukraine to be able to defend its territory. Regardless of who emerges victorious, the current geopolitical scenario bodes quite well for the defense contractor industry.The defense industry is one of the few industries to have emerged largely unscathed from the pandemic and has continued to maintain modest growth in the US, while delivering significant growth in Europe, according to a report by PwC. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, global military spending set a new record of $2.1 trillion in 2021, and remember, this was before a major war which has led to significantly higher military spending in 2022 by most of the Western countries. While the industry wasn't majorly affected by the pandemic, it did face some issues especially due to worker absenteeism and supply chain shortages, after the global supply chain faced considerable challenges.Before the Russian invasion, most military spending was to counter terrorism, especially in the United States and Europe. For other countries such as India and Pakistan, military spending is to ensure preparedness amidst rising tensions between the two countries, especially after India's Air Force transgressed Pakistani territory and was shot down by the Pakistan Army. Meanwhile, China has also continued to spend massively on its military, to establish its might even as relations with the West continue to deteriorate and skirmished with India, its neighbor, have taken place as well. China, along with the United States, dominates the list of the biggest defense contractors in the world.Story continuesLargest Defense Contractors in the World in 2022Photo by Somchai Kongkamsri from PexelsAfter Russia's invasion, priorities of Western nations have changed significantly, reverting more to Cold War style priorities; as an example, both Finland and Sweden have applied for NATO membership after the invasion despite threats by Russia. Meanwhile, the United States, realizing the importance of countering Russian aggression, has pledged at least $16.9 billion to Ukraine since January 2021, of which $16.2 billion have been provided after the invasion in February. The European Union member countries have also not held back, providing important weapons and aid to Ukraine, which is a major reason why it has been able to resist Russia's invasion to this extent so far, and this increase in defense spending is beneficial to the biggest defense contractors in the world in 2022.According to the Business Research Company, the global defense market grew from $475 billion in 2021 to $514 billion in 2022, at a CAGR of 8.2%, aided by the Russia Ukraine war, and is expected to increase at a CAGR of 3.2% to $581 billion by 2026. To determine the biggest defense contractors in the world in 2022, we referred the Fortune 500 global list and the Fortune 500 list. We then ranked each defense company based on its revenues, profits, assets and number of employees, with 40% weightage being assigned to the first two criteria and 20% weightage being assigned to the last two.

As the US economy started to recover from its pandemic-driven recession, electricity sales grew 3.8% through August 2021 compared to the prior year. The electric power industry is undergoing decarbonization, digitalization, and decentralization. Heading into the last quarter of 2021, 46 out of 54 American investor-owned utility firms had pledged to lower carbon emissions, and many set a target of net zero carbon by 2050. In 2022, even more utilities jumped on board and reaffirmed commitments, driven by consumer support, chances for adding value, advanced environmental, social, and governance (ESG) targets, growing clean energy mandates, and potential federal subsidies. The global utilities market grew from $5,488.88 billion in 2021 to $5,937.42 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.2%.

Approximately 70% of its revenue comes from Texas, where it owns one of the largest natural gas pipeline systems in the state.High-Quality BusinessSome of the quality characteristics we have identified for Atmos Energy include:-Strong balance sheet and financial strength, perhaps most visible during 2021’s winter storm Uri when millions of Texans lost power. The significant spikes in natural gas prices stressed distributors, but Atmos handled over $2 billion of incremental costs with little long-term impact;-Experienced and shareholder-friendly management team, as demonstrated by 38 consecutive years of dividend increases; and-Attractive demographics and favorable regulatory environments in the states where it operates.Attractive ValuationGiven our estimates of higher normalized earnings and dividend payments, we believe shares of Atmos Energy are trading at a discount relative to our estimate of their intrinsic value.Compelling CatalystsCatalysts we have identified for Atmos Energy, which we believe will cause its stock price to appreciate over our three- to five-year investment horizon, include:-Old pipes and aging infrastructure, coupled with a growing population, have created a large backlog of safety and maintenance projects – completion of which should drive earnings growth and steady dividend increases. Updates should both increase reliability as well as the value of Atmos Energy’s assets, enhancing profit levels permitted by regulators;-Well positioned to source low-cost natural gas from prolific basins in Texas to its distribution network, helping to keep customer prices down and economically favorable relative to other sources of energy; and-Advantageous regulatory environment should continue to support rate adjustments so that revenues are earned on capital projects within six to 12 months.”7.

The conflict and economic sanctions against Russia have brought to the forefront EU dependence on Russian oil and natural gas. As Germany and its EU neighbors look to diversify their natural gas suppliers, some U.S. companies stand to benefit. Within the portfolio, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) is well-positioned. Sempra’s previously underappreciated portfolio of infrastructure assets, with existing as well as prospective liquified natural gas (LNG) facilities, should benefit from renewed interest in U.S.-sourced LNG. The U.S. commitment to increase LNG exports to Europe over the coming years should create a favorable long-term demand environment and hopefully regulatory framework benefiting Sempra along with other natural gas and LNG suppliers. Sempra’s core utilities operations in California and Texas continue to generate solid mid- to high-single-digit earnings growth, and it enjoys additional growth opportunities from renewable natural gas (RNG), hydrogen and other renewable sources of energy.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Utility Dividend Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:10 Biggest Courier Companies in the World10 Most Successful Penny Stocks Ever12 Biggest Genomics Companies in the World Disclosure: None. 10 Best Utility Dividend Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Now, cheap is appealing.”Demand for dividend stocks is also rising as money managers promote stocks with a history of paying dividends to shareholders, hoping that this strategy will prove to be a safe haven for investors who face big portfolio losses from the broader market.

(NASDAQ:PDCO), a leading distributor of dental and animal health related products, reported first quarter results that included a sequential decline in dental equipment-related sales and price deflation in consumables. The former is in part a hangover from a strong fourth quarter while price deflation is being driven by inventory build-ups during COVID. With a healthy 4% dividend yield and attractive valuation, only 11X estimated earnings, we continue to hold Patterson. Notably too, a competitor in the dental space, Henry Schein, Inc., trades at a 1.5x+ premium to PDCO on estimated EBITDA while Covetrus, Inc., an animal health player, was acquired for 14.0x EBITDA in May.”10.

The company offers dialysis therapies and services, intravenous therapies, infusion pumps, drug reconstitution devices, and oncology drug platforms. The company's Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.82 was in-line with analyst’s estimates. The revenue of $3.8 billion climbed 17.6% year-over-year, outperforming market consensus by $30 million. Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) is one of the best dividend stocks to invest in. On October 17, investment advisory Barclays initiated coverage of Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) with an Overweight rating and a $64 price target. Analyst Matt Miksic issued the ratings update. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Baxter International Inc.

David Blood and Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 13 million shares valued at $836 million. Here is what Cooper Investors has to say about Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“During the quarter we exited our position in Baxter, having originally bought in 2017 as a Low Risk Turnaround with clear Stalwart attributes. In essence, the core businesses were highly durable, providing life sustaining or saving medical products such as IV medication or pumps and dialysis machines.They had been mismanaged prior to the company spinning off its biopharmaceutical business in 2015 which had generated most of Baxter's operating profit. With a new CEO in Joe Almeida, who came with a successful track record leading another medical device company (Covidien) we identified three sources of value latency for the new standalone Baxter.Firstly, optimizing the cost structure. Baxter was successful here – they were able to effectively double operating margins from low single digits to mid-to-high teens over a relatively short four-year period. Secondly, accelerating sales growth through a more focused R&amp;D effort. This is inherently more difficult than cost optimisation and on this front success has been muted with only moderate impact to revenues from new product introductions. Finally, capital deployment through Baxter’s significantly under-levered balance sheet. Several smaller bolt-on acquisitions were nicely complementary to the existing portfolio, but in early September the company announced the acquisition of Hil-Rom Holdings, a medical device company with leading positions in bed systems and patient monitoring. The deal is significant at US$12.5bn in size, and exhausts all balance sheet latency in one fell swoop.Whilst it is “EPS accretive” we believe the high single digit ROIC management are targeting over five years is most reflective of the financial merits of the deal. Put another way, despite visions of providing digital and connected healthcare (think a Baxter IV pump combined with a Hil-Rom smart bed), ultimately the combined entity will likely remain a low-to-mid-single digit grower. Baxter looks like it is getting bigger but not necessarily better.This combination of uncertainty around the merits of the Hil-Rom acquisition and the underwhelming performance on the product development side of the business led us to conclude that the investment proposition today is less attractive relative to other opportunities.”7. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Dividend Yield as of October 28: 5.25%Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is one of the premier healthcare dividend stocks to buy now. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

(NASDAQ:WBA) to $41 from $38 and reaffirmed a Hold rating on the shares. The analyst's core takeaway from the latest earnings call is that the speed of decline in pharmacy may have troughed and that Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) may be in a position to make market share gains in the pharmacy space.According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 40 hedge funds were long Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), compared to 38 funds in the preceding quarter. Stephen Dubois’ Camber Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 2.8 million shares worth $107 million. Here is what Aristotle Capital Management Global Equity has to say about Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company’s progress.”6.

In light of the high quality of companies in our portfolio, this was a difficult decision to make. Ultimately, we chose to sell Agilent, as its current share price approached our conservative estimate of intrinsic value. If we did not need the capital, we would not have sold the stock.Agilent has been a highly successful investment since our original purchase nearly two years ago, compounded by our additional investment in the company in the Covid market decline last year. Agilent’s stock price has increased 2.2 times since our initial purchase as a result of the company’s acceleration in revenue growth and profitability.10 Agilent has been a critical supplier of technology and services to labs around the world fighting the Covid pandemic. The company’s management team led by Mike McMullen deserves enormous credit for the company’s success and for its important contribution to science and the fight against Covid for which we all should be extremely grateful.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:Best Dividend Stocks Under $5Best Stocks For Beginners with Little Money11 Best Insurance Stocks That Pay Dividends Disclosure: None. 11 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best November Dividend Stocks To Buy.Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), and CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF) are some of the most prominent companies that are making dividend payments in November 2022.Whether you’re looking to start building out a portfolio of dividend stocks, or fill in some of the monthly gaps in your dividend stocks collection so you have a steady stream of income from them, November is a good month to target.Some of the best dividend stocks on the market, which boast attractive yields and strong dividend growth rates are paying out in November. All of the stocks on this list make their payments in the second half of the month and have yet to pass their ex-dividend date (as of the time of publication), so it’s not too late to add any of them to your portfolio and collect their November dividend payments.Among the top November dividend stocks are more than a dozen Dividend Aristocrats, which are companies that have increased their annual dividend payouts for at least 25 straight years. A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) are just some of the Dividend Aristocrats paying out this month.There are even some Dividend Kings (50+ consecutive years of annual dividend increases) paying out this month that make great additions to any dividend portfolio. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) feature prominently on that list. However, all of the aforementioned stocks have passed their ex-dividend date (the date before which one must be a shareholder of the company to receive its next dividend payment), so none of those companies are included in this list.Even without those major dividend players, the list of best dividend stocks that pay in November isn’t left wanting for strong dividend stocks, as evidenced by the following list. In it, we’ll examine each stock’s dividend history, payout and ex-dividend dates, payout ratio, and other factors so you can make an informed decision about whether or not the stock in question would make a good addition to your dividend portfolio.Story continues10 Best November Dividend Stocks To BuyPhoto by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/Our MethodologyThe following November dividend stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.10 Best November Dividend Stocks To Buy10. Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE:ALX)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 9 November 18 Dividend Payout: $4.50 CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) are some of the major November dividend payers to consider for your portfolio. A lesser known company that also makes its next dividend payment this month is REIT Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE:ALX).Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE:ALX) has paid out dividends for ten straight years, though its quarterly dividend payments have been stalled at $4.50 for the last five years. Nonetheless, the stock boasts an attractive dividend yield of 7.81%. The ex-dividend date for the next payment is November 4.In addition to its dividend payments, there are other potential ways for investors to make money off ALX, as the company reportedly has an interested buyer willing to take it private at a significant premium according to an open letter to ALX shareholders issued by Lionbridge Capital in July. In the letter, Lionbridge urged the company to consider several other changes that could unlock shareholder value, believing that mismanagement has left the company severely underrated by the market. It estimates Alexander’s Net Asset Value to be over $400 per share, more than 70% greater than the stock’s current price.Hedge fund ownership of Alexander’s, Inc. (NYSE:ALX) ticked up in Q2 but is down by 31% from its peak reached in the second quarter of 2021. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management and Paul Tudor Jones’ Tudor Investment Corp added ALX to their 13F portfolios during Q2, while Frank Brosens’ Taconic Capital held the largest stake in the company consisting of 142,300 shares.9. Comfort Systems USA, Inc. (NYSE:FIX)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 14 November 28 Dividend Payout: $0.15 Comfort Systems USA, Inc. (NYSE:FIX) has grown its dividend at an impressive CAGR of 13.2% over the past five years, though the stock’s yield is still rather light at just 0.49%. Nonetheless, with a payout ratio of just 11%, this is a dividend stock that could continue to grow at a steady rate for years to come. The ex-dividend date for the company’s next payment is November 16. That payment will be one cent higher for the second time this year and 36% higher than it was two years ago.Comfort Systems USA, Inc. (NYSE:FIX), which provides installation, maintenance, and repair services for heating, air conditioning, and ventilation systems, had a strong Q3 despite warning of cost and input challenges back in July. The company pulled in $1.71 in EPS, which topped estimates by 25%, while its $1.12 billion in revenue also beat estimates. Comfort Systems also has a robust backlog, which should ensure continued organic growth in the quarters to come.The number of smart money managers with long positions in Comfort Systems USA, Inc. (NYSE:FIX) fell by 44% between the middle of 2021 and the end of March 2022, hitting its lowest point in five years. Hedge fund ownership of the stock remained flat during Q2. Chuck Royce’s Royce &amp; Associates maintained the largest position in FIX for the tenth straight quarter, owning 383,851 shares as of June 30 after nearly doubling the size of position during the quarter.8. Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 17 November 23 Dividend Payout: $0.50 There’s been a lot of activity surrounding Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO)’s dividend payments in recent quarters. The company made six consecutive quarterly hikes to its dividend beginning in Q3 2020, and then raised it by another 25% in the second quarter of this year. However, it’s since had to cut its dividend in each of the last two quarters, paring its payout back to Q4 2020 levels. The stock, which has an ex-dividend date of November 8, still has an attractive yield of over 4%.Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO)’s Q2 revenue and EPS took major year-over-year hits, falling to $2.31 billion and $0.56 respectively from $2.9 billion and $1.21 a year earlier, as demand weakens. With Goldman Sachs predicting copper scarcity in the coming years, the company is well positioned to capitalize given its advantageous cost/curve position and sizable exposure to copper.Hedge fund ownership of Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO) fell by 38% between Q1 2021 and Q2 2022, but did tick up slightly during the second quarter. Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake in SCCO, while fellow billionaire Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group added SCCO to its 13F portfolio during the quarter.7. Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 26 November 28 Dividend Payout: $0.28 Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) has nearly tripled the size of its quarterly dividend over the past five years, growing it at an impressive CAGR of 21.9% during that time. That rapid growth has lifted its yield to a respectable 2.38%, and with a payout ratio of just 32%, that yield could push towards 3% in the coming years. The company’s next dividend payment has an ex-dividend date of November 11.A manufacturer of a wide range of home improvement products, Masco did run into some difficulty in Q3, missing its earnings guidance and cutting its full-year outlook, citing weakness in its plumbing and paints segments. The company could face continued pressure throughout next year amid a weakened housing market, but has a strong balance sheet and cash flows that should see it through the period without any risk to its dividend.Hedge funds have been bailing on Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) this year, as there’s been a 36% decline in the number of funds long MAS through the end of June. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Greg Poole’s Echo Street Capital Management were a couple of the funds to unload their stakes in Masco during the second quarter.On the other hand, Oakmark Fund believes the market is undervaluing Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS), as detailed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“We believe the market is failing to properly reward Masco (NYSE:MAS), a leader in home improvement products, for the significant upgrade of its business mix over the past decade. Having previously sold its more cyclical, lower return businesses, such as insulation, windows, and cabinets, what remains are some of the strongest and most recognizable brands in the industry. The company’s portfolio of products-primarily coatings (Behr) and plumbing fixtures (Delta, Hansgrohe)-are more resilient, lower ticket, and higher margin categories. Both segments compete within heavily consolidated industries, exhibit strong pricing power and skew meaningfully toward the less cyclical repair and remodel market. Despite its greatly improved business mix, Masco trades for just 10x next year’s expected earnings, which is a discount to historical levels and comfortably below a market multiple. We believe this dislocation presents an attractive opportunity to invest in a well-managed, high-quality portfolio in a sector that’s currently out of favor.”6. KB Home (NYSE:KBH)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 29 November 23 Dividend Payout: $0.15 Another home-related stock closes out the first half of this list in the form of homebuilder KB Home (NYSE:KBH), whose dividend payments have flat lined this year after rising by 400% between 2018 and 2021. The company has a miniscule payout ratio of just 7%, which is impressive for a stock with a decent yield of just over 2%. The ex-dividend date to collect KBH’s next dividend payment is November 9.With home prices deteriorating, particularly in KB Home (NYSE:KBH)’s core West Coast markets, analysts believe the company may need to sacrifice some of its margins to continue driving sales. RBC Capital analyst Mike Dahl slashed his FY23 EPS forecast for the company to $6.97 from $9.57 in September, but noted that near-term risks are already priced into the stock given that it trades at just 0.7x tangible book value.Hedge fund ownership of KB Home (NYSE:KBH) shot up by 38% during the fourth quarter of 2021 to hit an all-time high, but had since fallen back slightly. Charles Clough’s Clough Capital Partners and Mark Coe’s Intrinsic Edge Capital were some of the funds to add KBH stakes to their portfolios last Q4. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held the largest position in KB Home on June 30, owning 2.43 million shares.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF), and Citigroup Inc.

The newly published, 2023 Financial Institutions Industry Outlook, is part of S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's Big Picture 2023 Outlook Report Series. Net charge-offs will rise but cost of funding loan losses will be manageableThe new report finds the return of higher interest rates is welcomed by many financial institutions but brings its share of risks as well. Higher rates and elevated inflation have raised fears of potential recession and the prospect of notably higher loan losses for banks, slower growth for life insurers, risks to downside for the property and casualty insurance space and much greater demands from investors supporting fintech startups. Higher rates are generally positive for U.S. banks and the U.S. life and annuity industry, but elevated inflation threatens banks' credit quality, property and casualty insurers' underwriting profitability and the related market volatility presents challenges to life insurers and has forced fintech startups to shift their focus from growth to achieving profitability.""U.S. financial institutions waited for the return of higher rates with bated breath after several years of pandemic-era policies pressured investment yields but persistently high inflation and sharp rate hikes by the Fed have proved a double-edged sword,"" said Nathan Stovall, principal research analyst at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. ""Higher rates support profits for many financial institutions but the abrupt end to free money could put pressure on their customers and has already reduced access to capital for some startups.""Key highlights from the report include:Higher interest rates will push U.S. bank margins notably higher in 2022. S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence expect banks' margins to expand by 27 basis points in 2022 to 2.77% and then climb modestly higher to 2.79% in 2023.Higher rates and elevated inflation have also raised recessionary fears and the prospect of notably higher loan losses for U.S. banks. Credit costs are expected to normalize in 2023 and prevent earnings from growing from year-ago levels but believe that losses will be manageable.Inflationary pressures on some U.S. property and casualty business lines in 2022 will set the stage for continued outsized written premium growth in 2023 even in the context of an economic downturn. In the meantime, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence expect those pressures will lead to the industry posting a calendar-year combined ratio for 2022 in excess of 100% for the first time since 2017.Rising interest rates have fueled especially strong expansion in individual fixed deferred and indexed annuities in 2022. But S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence expect overall life, annuity and accident-and-health premiums and considerations to grow at a considerably slower pace in 2023, with a projected rate that is less than half of our 2022 estimate of 6.4%.Story continuesTo request a copy of the 2023 Financial Institutions Industry Outlook, please contact pressinquiries.mi@spglobal.com.S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's opinions, quotes, and credit-related and other analyses are statements of opinion as of the date they are expressed and not statements of fact or recommendation to purchase, hold, or sell any securities or to make any investment decisions, and do not address the suitability of any security.About S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence At S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, we understand the importance of accurate, deep and insightful information.

89,ee0e42cb-08a8-3f1e-8384-b221e2f6f5f4,SPGI,2022-10-31,S&P Global Mobility Special Report: A reckoning for EV battery raw materials,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/p-global-mobility-special-report-121500868.html,1667218500,STORY,['SPGI'],"[Geopolitical upheaval and supply chain transformation challenge aspirational volume targetsBy Graham Evans, Director, Auto Supply Chain &amp; Technology, S&amp;P Global MobilitySOUTHFIELD, Mich., Oct. 31, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Geopolitical turbulence and the fragile and volatile nature of the critical raw-material supply chain could curtail planned expansion in battery production—slowing mainstream electric-vehicle (EV) adoption and the transition to an electrified future.Pricing of key li-ion battery metalsGeopolitical turbulence, critical battery raw-material supply chain could curtail expansion in battery production.Soaring prices of critical battery metals, as observed in the following chart from S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, are threatening supplier and OEM profit margins. This situation has quickly translated into increased component and vehicle prices, according to new analysis from S&amp;P Global Mobility Auto Supply Chain &amp; Technology Group.Trade friction and ESG concerns are also affecting the development of the raw materials supply chain between markets. These collective developments add to the challenges of the electric vehicle transition.Achieving its volume goals will require a steep growth curve for a burgeoning industry. For OEMs to hit their BEV and hybrid sales aspirations, S&amp;P Global Mobility forecasts market demand of about 3.4 Terawatt hours (TWh) of lithium-ion batteries, annually, by 2030. This figure excludes the medium- and heavy-duty, and micro-mobility spaces, as well as consumer electronics and burgeoning demand for stationary energy storage. The 2021 output for the auto industry: 0.29 TWh.Elements such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt do not just magically appear and transform into EV batteries and other components. The development chain is lengthy and complex, from their difficulty to extract to their complicated refining. The intermediate steps between excavation and final assembly are a particular choke point in terms of expertise and market presence. Currently, China is the clear leader in materials refining, as well as the packaging and assembly of battery cells. At issue is which other nations will step up to facilitate this industry transformation.Story continuesIn terms of accessing battery raw materials, the equation boils down to: Who needs what, where will it come from, who will supply it, and who is best placed to benefit from this increased dependency on a handful of critical elements?The latest S&amp;P Global Mobility research evaluates the battery raw material supply chain from extraction to vehicle, identifying:A number of unfamiliar companies will play a major role in the processing and development of battery-electric vehicle (BEV) technology that will underpin the light passenger vehicles of the coming decade and beyond;Potential trade friction could represent difficulties for major auto companies in extricating themselves from an established, nimble, and cost-effective supply of processed materials coming from or via mainland China;Some OEMs are seeking the value and reassurance of ""locked in"" supply chain relationships straddling mine to vehicle, lessening the reliance on volatile spot markets and/or a need to work with less established industry partners.The process flow below identifies a well-understood and well-documented supply chain to provide the required nickel and lithium for Tesla's NCA-based cylindrical cells produced in its ""Gigafactory"" near Sparks, Nevada, US.Now extrapolate that across the entire auto industry—and expand EV market share to encompass the bullish projections made for 2030 and beyond.The greatest quantity of nickel required by any given vehicle brand for 2030 production is forecast to be Tesla—deemed to be some 139,000 metric tons (mT). However, in assessing the existing structure of their broader manufacturing bases, we expect each of Volkswagen, General Motors, and Stellantis to surpass this requisition amount. Developing modular battery packs that can be configured to fit multiple vehicle segments and can accommodate a variety of battery chemistry choices will ensure a degree of resiliency against raw material supply constraints and price fluctuations.""We have identified a total of 28 extraction sources of battery-grade nickel over the coming 12 years to serve the light passenger-vehicle market, located in 15 countries worldwide,"" said Dr Richard Kim, Associate Director with S&amp;P Global Mobility's Supply Chain &amp; technology team. ""However, the supply base for the upstream material processing steps and formation of the fundamental battery cell cathode chemistries presents a challenging lack of geographic diversity.""S&amp;P Global Mobility research suggests that, while the process of either smelting or high-pressure acid leaching (HPAL) is typically done at the nickel extraction site, that is not the case for the process of conversion to nickel sulphate.Of the 16 companies that can perform this process at present, 11 are in mainland China. By 2030 we expect the number of companies to increase to at least 24, of which 14 will likely be in mainland China. We forecast mainland China to process 824,000 mT of nickel sulphate annually by 2030, with Chinese mining giant GEM's supply of nickel sulphate to key Tesla supplier CATL expected to be the largest supply contract by tonnage. By contrast, we forecast North America and Europe to process just 146,000 mT.We must also consider risk in calculating access to cobalt—a material well understood for its limited sources of origin and concerns regarding ethical supply. Battery-grade cobalt bound for electrified light passenger vehicles currently originate from just 18 mines, totalling 52,000 mT – of which 29,000 mT is forecast to be mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 2022. The United Nations has cited the DRC's ""deteriorating security situation,"" its humanitarian crisis affecting 27 million people, as well as child-labor practices and the ongoing guerrilla campaign being waged over the exploitation of resources and food security.Despite the conflicts ravaging the DRC, we still estimate that nation's output bound for OEMs and suppliers to increase to 37,000 mT by 2030. However, reliance on the DRC will decrease from 56% to 17% in terms of total tonnage. We expect near tenfold increases in supply from countries such as Australia and Indonesia, while countries such as Vietnam, Finland, and Morocco will by then weigh in with meaningful contributions. Given the dynamics of the supply market, even for an OEM with locked-in cobalt contracts with miners, a portion of several automakers' supply remains unknown at this stage.""Geopolitics has coupled with a desire for supply chain dominance and independence in the battery raw material supply chain evolution to date,"" said Dr Kim. ""China has established a firm head start. The evolution of their Belt and Road initiative clearly had one eye on the automotive industry transition to electrification, with broad strategic and logistical investments in Africa as well as Southeast Asia.""S&amp;P Global Mobility research clearly indicates that established battery raw material supply and processing operations under mainland Chinese ownership will continue to deliver much of the world's supply of lithium-ion batteries and their constituent key elements.However, the imposition of nationalistic policies such as the United States' Inflation Reduction Act (and the automotive implications of it) look to belatedly redress some of this imbalance by promoting the setup of domestic supply chains, in return for lucrative subsidies to both the suppliers and the purchasing consumers.The battery will be the defining technological and supply chain battleground for the industry in the next decade, and access to their constituent raw materials will be crucial. S&amp;P Global Mobility will continue to assess the changing landscape of the battery raw materials market in real time, incorporating the latest industry developments and research.Please contact automotive@spglobal.com to find out more information around our insights to help you make data-driven decisions with conviction.Editor's Note: This report is from S&amp;P Global Mobility, and not S&amp;P Global Ratings, which is a separately managed division of S&amp;P Global.  About S&amp;P Global Mobility (www.spglobal.com/mobility)At S&amp;P Global Mobility, we provide invaluable insights derived from unmatched automotive data, enabling our customers to anticipate change and make decisions with conviction.

91,68d32107-c91e-302f-9406-48dde3122073,SPGI,2022-10-31,Is SPDR S&P Global Dividend ETF (WDIV) a Strong ETF Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spdr-p-global-dividend-etf-102010831.html,1667211610,STORY,['SPGI'],"[The SPDR S&amp;P Global Dividend ETF (WDIV) made its debut on 05/29/2013, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the World ETFs category of the market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.Market cap weighted indexes work great for investors who believe in market efficiency. They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexBecause the fund has amassed over $219.97 million, this makes it one of the larger ETFs in the World ETFs. WDIV is managed by State Street Global Advisors. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the S&amp;P Global Dividend Aristocrats Index.The S&amp;P Global Dividend Aristocrats Index measures the performance of high dividend-yield companies included in the S&amp;P Global BMI that have followed a managed-dividends policy of increasing or stable dividends for at least ten consecutive years.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Story continuesOperating expenses on an annual basis are 0.40% for WDIV, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 5.62%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsMost ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.Taking into account individual holdings, H&amp;r Block Inc. (HRB) accounts for about 2.43% of the fund's total assets, followed by Ltc Properties Inc. (LTC) and Keyera Corp. (KEY-CA).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 17.47% of WDIV's total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, WDIV has lost about -14.15%, and is down about -13.38% in the last one year (as of 10/31/2022). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $51.92 and $69.09.The fund has a beta of 0.80 and standard deviation of 21.50% for the trailing three-year period, which makes WDIV a low risk choice in this particular space. With about 115 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSPDR S&amp;P Global Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI) tracks MSCI All Country World Index and the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) tracks FTSE Global All Cap Index. IShares MSCI ACWI ETF has $15.36 billion in assets, Vanguard Total World Stock ETF has $21.88 billion. ACWI has an expense ratio of 0.32% and VT charges 0.07%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the World ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can find this and other information in each prospectus, or summary prospectus, if available, at www.franklintempleton.com. Please read it carefully.Prior to close of business on October 28, 2022, the Funds referenced operated as open-end mutual funds. The Funds have an identical investment goal and substantially similar investment strategies as the predecessor mutual funds.All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.BrandywineGLOBAL–Dynamic US Large Cap Value ETF Risks:Equity securities are subject to price fluctuation and possible loss of principal. The value approach to investing involves the risk that stocks may remain undervalued. Value stocks may underperform the overall equity market while the market concentrates on growth stocks. The manager’s investment style may become out of favor and/or the manager’s selection process may prove incorrect, which may have a negative impact on the Fund’s performance.Martin Currie Sustainable International Equity ETF Risks:Equity securities are subject to price fluctuation and possible loss of principal. Small- and mid-cap stocks involve greater risks and volatility than large-cap stocks. The fund may be significantly overweight to underweight certain companies, industries or market sectors, which may cause the fund's performance to be more sensitive to developments affecting those companies, industries or sectors. International investments are subject to special risks including currency fluctuations, as well as social, economic and political uncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. To the extent the fund focuses its investments in a single country or only a few countries in a particular geographic region, economic, political, regulatory or other conditions affecting such country or region may have a greater impact on fund performance relative to a more geographically diversified fund. The managers’ environmental social and governance (ESG) strategies may limit the types and number of investments available and, as a result, may forego favorable market opportunities or underperform strategies that are not subject to such criteria. ESG factors or criteria are subjective and qualitative, and the analysis by the manager may not always accurately assess ESG practices of a security or issuer, or reflect the opinions of other investors or advisors. There is no guarantee that the strategy's ESG directives will be successful or will result in better performance and may not work as intended. Derivatives, such as options and futures, can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on fund performance. In addition to the fund's operating expenses, the fund will indirectly bear the operating expenses of any underlying funds. The fund is classified as ""non-diversified,"" which means it may invest a larger percentage of its assets in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund. To the extent the fund invests its assets in a smaller number of issuers, the fund will be more susceptible to negative events affecting those issuers than a diversified fund.ETFs trade like stocks, fluctuate in market value and may trade at prices above or below their net asset value. Brokerage commissions and ETF expenses will reduce returns. ETF shares may be bought or sold throughout the day at their market price (MP), not their Net Asset Value (NAV), on the exchange on which they are listed. Shares of ETFs are tradable on secondary markets and may trade either at a premium or a discount to their NAV on the secondary market. Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the fund are ""created"" at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units. Each ""creator"" or ""Authorized Participant"" enters into an authorized participant agreement with Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc, an affiliate of the fund's sponsor, Franklin Holdings, LLC. Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units directly with the fund.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. The healthcare industry is evolving, and new trends are emerging. These trends include artificial intelligence being increasingly used by healthcare providers, healthcare becoming more personalized in terms of precision medicines, virtual healthcare becoming mainstream, and mental health being a priority, among others. In healthcare, biotechs are largely on the radar of investors who are on the hunt for low valuations. Some biotech companies, with new clinical data which indicates that their product is on the right path, have been able to raise funds in the market. $5.2 billion was raised in the third quarter, which was higher than the first two quarters combined. Vincent Meunier, a managing director at European investment bank Bryan Garnier &amp; Co, told Financial Times on October 26: “A couple of months ago, cheap was cheap but for good reasons. Now, cheap is appealing.”Demand for dividend stocks is also rising as money managers promote stocks with a history of paying dividends to shareholders, hoping that this strategy will prove to be a safe haven for investors who face big portfolio losses from the broader market. Healthcare has been one of the most prominent S&amp;P 500 segments with a resilient history of distributing dividends, and some of the best stocks to invest in include Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Our Methodology We selected the following healthcare dividend stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and robust dividend profiles. The dividend yields as of October 28 have been mentioned. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022. Story continues11 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashBest Healthcare Dividend Stocks To Buy Now11. Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20Dividend Yield as of October 28: 3.90%Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO) is a Minnesota-based company providing dental and animal health products in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The company offers biologicals, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, and dental equipment and services. On September 13, Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO) declared a $0.26 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on November 4, to shareholders of record on October 21. On October 17, Piper Sandler analyst Jason Bednar maintained an Overweight rating on Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $35 from $40. The lower multiple is due to reduced peer group multiples, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to the second quarter database of Insider Monkey, 20 hedge funds held stakes worth $167.70 million in Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO), compared to 18 funds in the prior quarter worth $143.70 million. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 1.6 million shares valued at $50.4 million. Like Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO) is one of the best healthcare dividends stocks to monitor. Here is what Heartland Advisors specifically said about Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO), a leading distributor of dental and animal health related products, reported first quarter results that included a sequential decline in dental equipment-related sales and price deflation in consumables. The former is in part a hangover from a strong fourth quarter while price deflation is being driven by inventory build-ups during COVID. With a healthy 4% dividend yield and attractive valuation, only 11X estimated earnings, we continue to hold Patterson. Notably too, a competitor in the dental space, Henry Schein, Inc., trades at a 1.5x+ premium to PDCO on estimated EBITDA while Covetrus, Inc., an animal health player, was acquired for 14.0x EBITDA in May.”10. Premier, Inc. (NASDAQ:PINC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25Dividend Yield as of October 28: 2.39%Premier, Inc. (NASDAQ:PINC) is a North Carolina-based healthcare improvement company in the United States. The company primarily delivers medical and surgical products, pharmaceuticals, laboratory supplies, capital equipment, clinical engineering, and workforce solutions. Premier, Inc. (NASDAQ:PINC) on October 21 declared a $0.21 per share quarterly dividend. The dividend is payable on December 15, to shareholders of record on December 1. Premier, Inc. (NASDAQ:PINC) is one of the best dividend stocks to invest in. On August 24, Benchmark analyst Bill Sutherland raised the price target on Premier, Inc. (NASDAQ:PINC) to $46 from $44 and kept a Buy rating on the shares following the company’s ""constructive"" FY23 guidance. The analyst was positive on Premier, Inc. (NASDAQ:PINC)’s outlook for FY23 and beyond given the high visibility of recently completed renewals of 5 to 7-year GPO contracts which drive significant free cash flow.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 25 hedge funds were bullish on Premier, Inc. (NASDAQ:PINC) at the end of June 2022, compared to 30 funds in the last quarter. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies held the leading position in the company, comprising 2.74 million shares worth $98 million.  9.

The dividend is payable on January 17, 2023 to shareholders of the company as of January 3.

Q3 results outperformed on revenue but fell short on EBITDA, primarily due to higher de novo losses, hurricane Ian disruption, and increased labor costs, the analyst told investors. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 34 hedge funds were long Encompass Health Corporation (NYSE:EHC), compared to 43 funds in the earlier quarter. Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2.95 million shares worth $165.3 million. 8. Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Dividend Yield as of October 28: 2.11%Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) is an Illinois-based company that develops a portfolio of healthcare products worldwide. The company offers dialysis therapies and services, intravenous therapies, infusion pumps, drug reconstitution devices, and oncology drug platforms. The company's Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.82 was in-line with analyst’s estimates. The revenue of $3.8 billion climbed 17.6% year-over-year, outperforming market consensus by $30 million. Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) is one of the best dividend stocks to invest in. On October 17, investment advisory Barclays initiated coverage of Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) with an Overweight rating and a $64 price target. Analyst Matt Miksic issued the ratings update. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) was part of 37 public stock portfolios at the end of June 2022, compared to 45 funds in the earlier quarter. David Blood and Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 13 million shares valued at $836 million. Here is what Cooper Investors has to say about Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“During the quarter we exited our position in Baxter, having originally bought in 2017 as a Low Risk Turnaround with clear Stalwart attributes. In essence, the core businesses were highly durable, providing life sustaining or saving medical products such as IV medication or pumps and dialysis machines.They had been mismanaged prior to the company spinning off its biopharmaceutical business in 2015 which had generated most of Baxter's operating profit. With a new CEO in Joe Almeida, who came with a successful track record leading another medical device company (Covidien) we identified three sources of value latency for the new standalone Baxter.Firstly, optimizing the cost structure. Baxter was successful here – they were able to effectively double operating margins from low single digits to mid-to-high teens over a relatively short four-year period. Secondly, accelerating sales growth through a more focused R&amp;D effort. This is inherently more difficult than cost optimisation and on this front success has been muted with only moderate impact to revenues from new product introductions. Finally, capital deployment through Baxter’s significantly under-levered balance sheet. Several smaller bolt-on acquisitions were nicely complementary to the existing portfolio, but in early September the company announced the acquisition of Hil-Rom Holdings, a medical device company with leading positions in bed systems and patient monitoring. The deal is significant at US$12.5bn in size, and exhausts all balance sheet latency in one fell swoop.Whilst it is “EPS accretive” we believe the high single digit ROIC management are targeting over five years is most reflective of the financial merits of the deal. Put another way, despite visions of providing digital and connected healthcare (think a Baxter IV pump combined with a Hil-Rom smart bed), ultimately the combined entity will likely remain a low-to-mid-single digit grower. Baxter looks like it is getting bigger but not necessarily better.This combination of uncertainty around the merits of the Hil-Rom acquisition and the underwhelming performance on the product development side of the business led us to conclude that the investment proposition today is less attractive relative to other opportunities.”7. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Dividend Yield as of October 28: 5.25%Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is one of the premier healthcare dividend stocks to buy now. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

(NASDAQ:WBA)’s dividend yield on October 28 came in at 5.25%. On October 25, Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill raised the price target on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) to $41 from $38 and reaffirmed a Hold rating on the shares. The analyst's core takeaway from the latest earnings call is that the speed of decline in pharmacy may have troughed and that Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

(NASDAQ:WBA), compared to 38 funds in the preceding quarter. Stephen Dubois’ Camber Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 2.8 million shares worth $107 million. Here is what Aristotle Capital Management Global Equity has to say about Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company’s progress.”6. Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Dividend Yield as of October 28: 0.61%Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) is a California-based company that offers application focused solutions to the life sciences, diagnostics, and applied chemical markets worldwide. Agilent Technologies, Inc.

(NYSE:A) with an Outperform rating and a $165 price target. The analyst believes that the Street ""underappreciates its ability to grow toward the top end of the industry in multiple macro environments."" The analyst thinks a premium multiple to its peers is appropriate for Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) given its swift growth prospects.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 41 hedge funds were bullish on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) at the end of June 2022, compared to 43 funds in the prior quarter. Ian Simm’s Impax Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.17 million shares worth $495 million. In addition to Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) is one of the best dividend stocks to buy according to elite hedge funds. Here is what Pershing Square Holdings has to say about Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“Our large commitment to UMG required that we raise cash from the sale of one of our other investments. In light of the high quality of companies in our portfolio, this was a difficult decision to make. Ultimately, we chose to sell Agilent, as its current share price approached our conservative estimate of intrinsic value. If we did not need the capital, we would not have sold the stock.Agilent has been a highly successful investment since our original purchase nearly two years ago, compounded by our additional investment in the company in the Covid market decline last year. Agilent’s stock price has increased 2.2 times since our initial purchase as a result of the company’s acceleration in revenue growth and profitability.10 Agilent has been a critical supplier of technology and services to labs around the world fighting the Covid pandemic. The company’s management team led by Mike McMullen deserves enormous credit for the company’s success and for its important contribution to science and the fight against Covid for which we all should be extremely grateful.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:Best Dividend Stocks Under $5Best Stocks For Beginners with Little Money11 Best Insurance Stocks That Pay Dividends Disclosure: None. 11 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most admired companies in the world.It seems that most companies are facing a reckoning right now. While corporations have often been lambasted because of their capitalistic nature and lack of regard for employees and the general population in lieu of massive profits, the protests against companies seem to have only amplified since the pandemic began. While the Occupy Wall Street protests initially began as a way to oppose the level of money involved in politics and income inequality, with references to the elite 1% holding much of the country's wealth, their ire soon turned to banks and major corporations. However, the protests did not sustain and, after beginning in 2011, faded by 2012.After the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the world, lockdowns were imposed in most countries around the globe and economies came to a standstill, with most business either shut down, or running on a vastly reduced scale. This led to companies laying of millions across the globe, with the hardest hit industries such as the travel industry laying off the most people, with major companies such as The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL) and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) each laying off thousands of employees. Many companies also considered this an opportunity to lay off employees and reduce costs despite record profits, with World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:WWE) one of such companies, laying off dozens of talent despite being at its most profitable.Most Admired Companies in the world in 2022However, the pandemic provided an opportunity to employees which resulted in an improvement in work-life balance in their lives. Many are now refusing to work unless it's completely remote, citing the reduced expenses because of not having to commute, not to mention the invaluable time saved. As the economy rebounded, many businesses realized that they needed more employees to run operations smoothly, only for employees to have realized their self-worth in the meanwhile and not being willing to go back to work under the same conditions that they'd been subjected to earlier. This has also led to the Great Resignation, an ongoing economic trend where employees are resigning en masse, starting in April 2021, where in the United States, more than four million resigned from their jobs, followed by 3.9 million resignations in June 2021.Story continuesThe demand of the employees is similar regardless of class, background and level of experience; better work-life balance, more flexibility and better compensation. According to a study carried out by PwC, 65% of employees said they were looking for a new job while 88% of executives admitted that the rate of turnover in their companies was higher than normal.Companies seem to be coming to the realization that the days of employee loyalty is over, as it should be, and that they need to do a lot more to improve relations between executives and employees. Further, companies are also significantly under fire due to their contributions to climate change. A 2017 report by the Guardian stated that just 100 companies across the world were responsible for 71% of global emissions, which the companies try to cover by attempting to transfer the onus to regular people, as if they're not to blame. In an effort to improve their image, many companies, including of course the most admired companies in the world, are attempting to rectify their contribution to climate change, often pledging to become carbon neutral or at least significantly reducing their carbon emissions over the next decade or two.The most admired companies in the world are also some of the most recognizable. These companies have long realized the importance of retaining and attracting top talent and creating and maintaining and image that has won them plaudits all over the world. We have used Fortune's annual ranking based on corporate reputation for 2021, with the rankings determined from responses from more than 3,700 executives, directors and analysts. These rankings don't insinuate that these are the most ethical companies free from any misdeeds plaguing them, which we'll cover more when talking about each company, but are simply an indication of the reputation and standing of the company. This is why some medical companies have climbed within the list since they've been on the forefront in the battle against the deadliest pandemic in a century. However, while we've chosen the top 20 from Fortune, we have then checked Google Trend statistics for each company. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the most admired companies in the world, starting with number 20:20. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was one of the first pharmaceutical companies to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, which has been essential and integral in allowing the resumption of normal activities across the globe. While Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was nowhere near the top 20 in the previous year, now it kicks off the list of most admired companies in the world as it led by example, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has perhaps been integral in dissipating some of the mistrust the general population has towards the biggest pharmaceutical companies.19. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the biggest conglomerates in the United States. While Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been much maligned for cancer causing talc-based baby powder and was ordered to pay $2.1 billion to the plaintiffs, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was one of the few companies to develop a valid Covid-19 vaccine, which was instrumental in curbing the pandemic.18. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is famous for selling quality items for lower prices and has gained admirers for its focus on sustainability and environmental, social and governance issues by setting measurable goals with the aim to to improve consistently. One of Target Corporation's (NYSE:TGT) recent initiatives includes investing $100 million into Black communities in an effort to combat racism and racial inequality.17. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) being considered an admired company will definitely rankle some feathers. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has faced a ton of lawsuits based on poor working conditions, low wages, poor health care and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) being involved in antiunion activities. The fact that it's still in this list speaks volumes about the disconnect between executives and average employees.16. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Topping the list of the most admired companies in the world for Fortune is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), though it only made it to 16th position in our list.  Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is constantly recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the world as well. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has topped every category used by Fortune in its determination including use of corporate assets, innovation, social responsibility, financial soundness, quality of management, quality of products and services and global competitiveness.15. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A)Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), run by the legendary Warren Buffett, is admired primarily because of the way its been run by the famous investor. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A) is the largest financial services company in the world by revenue.14. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the most well-known companies in the world. In fact, odds are if you're reading this article on a laptop, you're using Microsoft Windows to run your computer! Regularly rated as one of the best places to work at, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) encourages creativity and is held in high regards by its employees.13. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is one of the biggest chains in the world, with more than 33,000 stores globally. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) also pays full time tuition for all eligible partners in Arizona State University's online program, with more than 1,000 Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) partners having graduated through the program. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) aims to have more than 25,000 partners obtain a degree from ASU by 2025. However, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has also opposed the formation of unions.12. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)The most admired delivery company in the world, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has been a part of Fortune's list for at least 22 years. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has more than 850,000 employees worldwide, and despite allegations of distributed substances and narcotics not to mention allegations of tax evasion, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has still been able to maintain its view as an admired company.11. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the few major retailers which has actually been praised by current and ex-employees. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) may not have unions in the majority of locations but 15,000 employees are union members. Further, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has continuously raised the minimum wage of its workers, which is now $16 an hour.10. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the most popular streaming platforms in the world today, with more than 220 million subscribers across the globe. While making the list of the most admired companies in the world, it is unlikely that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be maintaining its ranking considering its poor performance recently losing subscribers while letting go 300 employees in June. Netflix Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has also seen its share price decline by 61% YTD in 2022.9. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) being among the most admired companies in the world is definitely going to be controversial, what with the internet being full of stories of the way Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) mistreats its workers, busts unions and tries to stifle worker rights in multiple instances, the truth is that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is still really admired because of its innovation for customers, support for communities and commitment to the environment. Of course, it's worth noting that it is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) itself which has mentioned the above reasons.8. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)One of the biggest sports goods manufacturers in the world, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has an incredibly strong brand reputation and brand loyalty, which has served it through decades. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)  is also famous for its innovation and creativity, though it does need to do more in terms of social responsibility.7. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL)While Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) infamously became the face of poor customer service after it dragged off a doctor from the plane in 2017, but to its credit, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) did reviews its policies after the incident to improve upon services provided.6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is the most admired media and entertainment company in the world. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has been admired in several areas including people management, use of corporate assets, social responsibility, quality of management and quality of products and services. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) seems to have a new lease on life with the launch of Disney+, which has been a massive success so far.Please continue to see the 5 Most Admired Companies in the World.Suggested articles:15 Most Valuable British Companies10 Biggest Publishing Companies in the World 15 Most Valuable Indian Tech Companies In The WorldDisclosure: None. 20 most admired companies in the world is originally published at Insider Monkey. ]"

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Merck (NYSE:MRK), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Merck with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Merck How Quickly Is Merck Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. It certainly is nice to see that Merck has managed to grow EPS by 19% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The good news is that Merck is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 10.9 percentage points to 41%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Merck's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Merck Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$255b company like Merck. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$194m. We note that this amounts to 0.08% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Merck but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Does Merck Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Merck's strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Merck's continuing strength. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 2 warning signs for Merck that you need to be mindful of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

104,9dfc971d-ae5d-38b9-9f31-9576ec4636c5,ROK,2022-10-31,Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) Has Announced That It Will Be Increasing Its Dividend To $1.18,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-automation-nyse-rok-announced-100139437.html,1667210499,STORY,['ROK'],"[Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) has announced that it will be increasing its periodic dividend on the 12th of December to $1.18, which will be 5.4% higher than last year's comparable payment amount of $1.12. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 1.7%. Check out our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation Rockwell Automation's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. Prior to this announcement, Rockwell Automation's dividend was making up a very large proportion of earnings and perhaps more concerning was that it was 107% of cash flows. This is certainly a risk factor, as reduced cash flows could force the company to pay a lower dividend.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 125.4%. Under the assumption that the dividend will continue along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 37% which would be quite comfortable going to take the dividend forward.historic-dividendRockwell Automation Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2012, the dividend has gone from $1.70 total annually to $4.48. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 10% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. Although it's important to note that Rockwell Automation's earnings per share has basically not grown from where it was five years ago, which could erode the purchasing power of the dividend over time.Rockwell Automation's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. We don't think Rockwell Automation is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've identified 4 warning signs for Rockwell Automation (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 largest defense contractors in the world in 2022.The world seems to be heading towards a recession, despite being able to seemingly get over a global pandemic due to the early development of a vaccine which saved millions of lives. Inflation has reached recorded highs, and while you may think that most countries would be focused on their own economies and trying to ease the lives of the people living in them, geopolitical upheaval has made a mockery of this belief. In February 2022, Russia initiated an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which eight months later, is still no closer to an end with heavy losses to both sides, though the latter has definitely suffered the worst of it, with thousands of civilians dying and major infrastructure being destroyed by Russia. The West, to counter growing Russian threat, has united against it despite some disagreements, and supplied weapons and aid to Ukraine to be able to defend its territory. Regardless of who emerges victorious, the current geopolitical scenario bodes quite well for the defense contractor industry.The defense industry is one of the few industries to have emerged largely unscathed from the pandemic and has continued to maintain modest growth in the US, while delivering significant growth in Europe, according to a report by PwC. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, global military spending set a new record of $2.1 trillion in 2021, and remember, this was before a major war which has led to significantly higher military spending in 2022 by most of the Western countries. While the industry wasn't majorly affected by the pandemic, it did face some issues especially due to worker absenteeism and supply chain shortages, after the global supply chain faced considerable challenges.Before the Russian invasion, most military spending was to counter terrorism, especially in the United States and Europe. For other countries such as India and Pakistan, military spending is to ensure preparedness amidst rising tensions between the two countries, especially after India's Air Force transgressed Pakistani territory and was shot down by the Pakistan Army. Meanwhile, China has also continued to spend massively on its military, to establish its might even as relations with the West continue to deteriorate and skirmished with India, its neighbor, have taken place as well. China, along with the United States, dominates the list of the biggest defense contractors in the world.Story continuesLargest Defense Contractors in the World in 2022Photo by Somchai Kongkamsri from PexelsAfter Russia's invasion, priorities of Western nations have changed significantly, reverting more to Cold War style priorities; as an example, both Finland and Sweden have applied for NATO membership after the invasion despite threats by Russia. Meanwhile, the United States, realizing the importance of countering Russian aggression, has pledged at least $16.9 billion to Ukraine since January 2021, of which $16.2 billion have been provided after the invasion in February. The European Union member countries have also not held back, providing important weapons and aid to Ukraine, which is a major reason why it has been able to resist Russia's invasion to this extent so far, and this increase in defense spending is beneficial to the biggest defense contractors in the world in 2022.According to the Business Research Company, the global defense market grew from $475 billion in 2021 to $514 billion in 2022, at a CAGR of 8.2%, aided by the Russia Ukraine war, and is expected to increase at a CAGR of 3.2% to $581 billion by 2026. To determine the biggest defense contractors in the world in 2022, we referred the Fortune 500 global list and the Fortune 500 list. We then ranked each defense company based on its revenues, profits, assets and number of employees, with 40% weightage being assigned to the first two criteria and 20% weightage being assigned to the last two.

107,25f1296b-63fe-3189-ac65-6099dcb0ba52,ILMN,2022-10-31,Ranking 7 Top Tech Stocks to Buy From Biggest to Smallest,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ranking-7-top-tech-stocks-131748651.html,1666963068,STORY,"['META', 'ILMN', 'ESLT.TA', 'BNGO', 'NOW', 'ENPH', 'SWAV']","[It’s true that the troika of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Meta (NASDAQ:META), much loved by the Street for the decade that ended in mid-2021, reported disappointing third-quarter results. Once viewed as beyond reproach by most, those three stocks are now being shunned and scorned by the “smart money.” But the Street is finally starting to realize, just because much of “Big Tech” is struggling doesn’t mean that there are no good tech stocks to buy. On the contrary, many tech firms are doing quite well and are poised to soar. Here are seven of the top tech stocks, ordered from largest market capitalization to smallest, that investors should consider buying.This list includes names from several of the hottest sectors, including biotech, solar, AI, electric vehicles, and defense.NOWServiceNow$415.67ENPHEnphase Energy$306.08ILMNIllumina$236.87ONON Semiconductor$64.85SWAVShockWave Medical$273.12ESLTElbit Systems$201.31BNGOBionano Genomics$2.14InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsServiceNow (NOW)ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Market Capitalization: $84 BillionServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) utilizes artificial intelligence to automate many routine IT tasks carried out by most companies. As a result, it saves firms a great deal of money.On Oct. 26, ServiceNow reported stellar third-quarter results, showing that the company’s business is thriving in the current macro environment. NOW’s income from operations jumped 23% (17/74) year-over-year in Q3 to $91 million. That’s a huge increase for a company as large as ServiceNow. Its subscription revenue, excluding certain items, soared 28.5% YOY to $1.83 billion, and its top line jumped 27.5%, again excluding certain items, to $1.93 billion. Moreover, NOW expects its Q4 subscription revenue to advance 26% for all of 2022.Put it all together, and it’s clear that ServiceNow is growing very rapidly, especially for a company of its size, and is quite profitable. Finding firms with those characteristics that are not widely known among the retail crowd is a formula for success in investing.Story continuesThe forward price-earnings ratio of NOW stock is 39. That’s high but not unreasonable for a company that’s growing so quickly. It is the the largest among the top tech stocks to buy on this list.Enphase Energy (ENPH)mobile phone screen with enphase energy logo on it to represent renewable energy stocksSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comMarket Capitalization: $41.4 billionShowing that the Street had greatly underestimated the proliferation of solar energy in general and Enphase’s (NASDAQ:ENPH) products in particular, ENPH’s Q3 results came in much higher than analysts’ average estimates on Oct. 27. Therefore, I believe it is among the top tech stocks to buy.ENPH, which makes inverters used in solar projects, reported Q3 EPS of $1.25, well above the average estimate of $1.09. Moreover, its top line increased by 81% year-over-year to a record $635 million, $19 million above the mean outlook. Meanwhile, Enphase reported an impressive operating income, excluding certain items, of $194 million.Responding to the results, investment bank Cowen raised its price target on ENPH stock to $335 from $278. The bank says that the company’s growth is poised to remain rapid this quarter, as demand for its products remains strong overall and expands its operations in Europe. Cowen kept an “overweight” rating on the shares.“In Europe, our revenue increased approximately 70% sequentially and 136% year-on-year, led by strong demand for our microinverters in Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, and Portugal, and for our IQ batteries in Germany and Belgium,” said Enphase CEO Badri Kothandaraman on the company’s Q3 earnings call.Illumina (ILMN)a representation of floating moleculesSource: ShutterstockMarket Capitalization: $37.2 BillionIllumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) is one of two biotech firms on this top tech stocks to buy list that recently reported under-the-radar, potentially game-changing news.In Illumina’s case, the company reported on Oct. 18 that it was partnering with GenoScreen to create a tool that could be used to reveal which patients have drug-resistant versions of tuberculosis quickly. Once such versions are identified, doctors can respond with appropriate treatments, saving many lives.The announcement shows that Illumina’s DNA sequencing tools can be used to diagnose illnesses and save many lives. Since ILMN is likely to make many more such deals, its financial results should significantly improve in the longer term, lifting its stock tremendously.And on Oct. 11, Illumina announced that it would partner with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), one of the world’s largest drug makers, to attempt to use ILMN’s artificial intelligence to accelerate the drug-making process. To the extent that the idea works and Illumina receive royalties on drug sales, this alliance could be a game changer down the road for the company and ILMN stock.ON Semiconductor (ON)Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.Source: ShutterstockMarket Capitalization: $28.1 BillionSome analysts like to say that computer chips are “commoditized.” But that appears to be an overgeneralization. That’s because chipmakers do have different capabilities and areas of specialization. For example, some specialize in making very small chips, while others focus on developing chips for automobiles.One of ON Semiconductor’s (NASDAQ:ON) areas of focus is silicon carbide chips, Investor’s Business Daily reported recently. The website explained that these chips are able to:…operate at much higher voltages, temperatures, and frequencies than traditional silicon-based semiconductors. That makes them a better choice for electric vehicles, solar power conversion, 5G wireless, aerospace, and other applications.Of course, all of those areas are booming. But the biggest initial demand for silicon carbide chips comes from the EV sector.Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay estimates that the sales of these chips will reach $2.2 billion this year versus $1.7 billion last year. In 2026, the figure will jump to $7.1 billion. “Silicon carbide has gone from esoteric to essential seemingly overnight,” he added.And notably, besides ON, Investor’s Business Daily only named one other company as being a leader in the silicon carbide space: Wolfspeed (NYSE:WOLF), whose market capitalization is a small $10.8 billion. So it does not appear that ON is facing a great deal of tough competition in the silicon carbide space.ShockWave Medical (SWAV)Image of a virtual heart in front of a diagramSource: ESB Professional/Shutterstock.comMarket Capitalization: $9.8 billionAs I pointed out in a previous column, Shockwave (NASDAQ:SWAV) has developed an innovative system that treats the widespread problem of cardiovascular calcium with shockwaves, enabling deep calcium to be eradicated. Such calcium increases the chances of heart attack, stroke, and death.And unlike an older method of eliminating cardiovascular calcium, called Atherectomy, Shockwave’s system does not spread calcium into the bloodstream, where it can cause harmful side effects.As I noted previously, indicating the attractiveness of SWAV’s system to medical professionals, its top line jumped to $121 million in Q2 this year versus $56 million in the same period last year.On Oct. 17, investment bank Piper Sandler wrote that the American Medical Association appears to have taken action last month, which will enable doctors to be reimbursed for using SWAV’s system starting in January 2024. The firm stated that the company “has done a great job navigating the reimbursement landscape for its IVL technology.” It kept a $338 price target and an “overweight” rating on the shares.Elbit Systems (ESLT)Hermes 900 drone at a showcaseSource: Jordan Tan / Shutterstock.comMarket Capitalization: $8.8 BillionIsrael-based Elbit (NASDAQ:ESLT), which makes high-tech products for militaries, appears to be benefiting from strong demand for advanced weapons in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine War and amid continued fears of expansionist moves by China and Iran.Just in the last few weeks, Elbit has announced several major contracts. Today the company announced that it had obtained a deal worth roughly $215 million over two years. Under the agreement, ESLT will provide an unnamed “Asia-Pacific country” with “an aerial intelligence solution.”Yesterday ESLT announced that it had obtained a 2.5-year deal worth roughly $65 million to provide “the first fully networked mechanized brigade solution to a Latin American Army,” On Oct. 12, the company stated that it would provide the U.S. Army with Enhanced Night Vision Goggles over two years for about $107 million. And finally, Elbit announced last month that it would provide Thailand with drones and training in a two-year deal worth $120 million. These deals should move the needle for Elbit’s financial results and ESLT stock.Further, as I pointed out in a previous column, Elbit “has helped to develop the world’s first inexpensive missile defense system.” Over the longer term, that should be a game changer for the shares, which is why I believe Elbit is one of the top tech stocks.Bionano Genomics (BNGO)Bionano Genomics (BNGO) company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the backgroundSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock.comMarket Capitalization: $619 millionBionano Genomics (NASDAQ:BNGO) recently announced that it, along with its partner, Hamilton, would, starting next quarter, begin shipping its product which enables rapid, “automated” system optical genome mapping. “The analysis of UHMW DNA can provide a more thorough way of detecting genomic aberrations that traditional cytogenetic methods may miss,” Bionano CEO Erik Holmlin explained.Since Bionano has demonstrated that OGM can detect important genetic anomalies missed by conventional DNA analysis, BNGO could generate a great deal of revenue from this product.Moreover, last month BNGO stated that it had started Bionano Laboratories. That organization will provide OGM data to organizations from Bionano’s lab, which was recently given the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) designation. That designation allows labs to be reimbursed by insurers for tests they carry out.Since OGM has proven to be very useful for identifying genetic abnormalities that make diseases more likely and obtaining reimbursement is a key factor in convincing healthcare professionals to utilize lab tests, these developments are likely to be momentous for Bionano and BNGO stock. Indeed, since Bionano announced the launch of Bionano Laboratories on Sept. 26, its stock has soared 36%. (0.68/1.86). Thus, it is one of the top tech stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in BNGO, ILMN, and ESLT.

109,634faebb-78b6-38ba-acc2-03063651f292,CI,2022-10-31,Risks To Shareholder Returns Are Elevated At These Prices For Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/risks-shareholder-returns-elevated-prices-120113507.html,1667217673,STORY,['CI'],"[With a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 19.6x Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) may be sending bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the elevated P/E.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Cigna's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Cigna peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Cigna will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Does Growth Match The High P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should outperform the market for P/E ratios like Cigna's to be considered reasonable.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 27% decrease to the company's bottom line. Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 41% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would probably welcome the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 11% per year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be similar to the 9.8% each year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we find it interesting that Cigna is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.Our examination of Cigna's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.Plus, you should also learn about these   2 warning signs we've spotted with Cigna.If you're unsure about the strength of Cigna's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 largest defense contractors in the world in 2022.The world seems to be heading towards a recession, despite being able to seemingly get over a global pandemic due to the early development of a vaccine which saved millions of lives. Inflation has reached recorded highs, and while you may think that most countries would be focused on their own economies and trying to ease the lives of the people living in them, geopolitical upheaval has made a mockery of this belief. In February 2022, Russia initiated an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which eight months later, is still no closer to an end with heavy losses to both sides, though the latter has definitely suffered the worst of it, with thousands of civilians dying and major infrastructure being destroyed by Russia. The West, to counter growing Russian threat, has united against it despite some disagreements, and supplied weapons and aid to Ukraine to be able to defend its territory. Regardless of who emerges victorious, the current geopolitical scenario bodes quite well for the defense contractor industry.The defense industry is one of the few industries to have emerged largely unscathed from the pandemic and has continued to maintain modest growth in the US, while delivering significant growth in Europe, according to a report by PwC. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, global military spending set a new record of $2.1 trillion in 2021, and remember, this was before a major war which has led to significantly higher military spending in 2022 by most of the Western countries. While the industry wasn't majorly affected by the pandemic, it did face some issues especially due to worker absenteeism and supply chain shortages, after the global supply chain faced considerable challenges.Before the Russian invasion, most military spending was to counter terrorism, especially in the United States and Europe. For other countries such as India and Pakistan, military spending is to ensure preparedness amidst rising tensions between the two countries, especially after India's Air Force transgressed Pakistani territory and was shot down by the Pakistan Army. Meanwhile, China has also continued to spend massively on its military, to establish its might even as relations with the West continue to deteriorate and skirmished with India, its neighbor, have taken place as well. China, along with the United States, dominates the list of the biggest defense contractors in the world.Story continuesLargest Defense Contractors in the World in 2022Photo by Somchai Kongkamsri from PexelsAfter Russia's invasion, priorities of Western nations have changed significantly, reverting more to Cold War style priorities; as an example, both Finland and Sweden have applied for NATO membership after the invasion despite threats by Russia. Meanwhile, the United States, realizing the importance of countering Russian aggression, has pledged at least $16.9 billion to Ukraine since January 2021, of which $16.2 billion have been provided after the invasion in February. The European Union member countries have also not held back, providing important weapons and aid to Ukraine, which is a major reason why it has been able to resist Russia's invasion to this extent so far, and this increase in defense spending is beneficial to the biggest defense contractors in the world in 2022.According to the Business Research Company, the global defense market grew from $475 billion in 2021 to $514 billion in 2022, at a CAGR of 8.2%, aided by the Russia Ukraine war, and is expected to increase at a CAGR of 3.2% to $581 billion by 2026.

Companies that have done so for 25 consecutive years are crowned Dividend Aristocrats, and there are 65 such companies on the S&amp;P 500.  Then there are the Dividend Kings, which have raised their annual payouts for at least 50 consecutive years.While those companies usually rank among the safest dividend stocks to own and are likely to continue growing their dividends at a modest pace in the years to come, many of them have relatively modest dividend growth rates in the single digits.To find some of the fastest growing dividend stocks of large cap companies often requires looking outside those vaunted lists. These are large companies that in many cases are growing their earnings faster than some of the long-time stalwarts on those lists, which in turn allows them to grow their dividends at a faster rate than those dividend greybeards.These stocks offer the potential for both share appreciation and strong double digit dividend growth over the long-term, which makes them a compelling mix of income and growth stock, and some of the most coveted top dividend stocks on the market.The following list of best dividend growth stocks have all grown their dividends at a CAGR of at least 10% over the past five years, meaning their dividend payments are more than 50% higher than what they were just five years ago.

United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 38 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 11.3% JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) are some of the best large cap dividend stocks with fast growing dividend payments. Another is United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), which has grown its dividend at a CAGR of 11.3% over the last five years. Much of that growth came this year, when UPS jacked its quarterly dividend payments by nearly 50% to $1.52. UPS has a 12-year run of dividend growth going, in addition to a 21-year run of dividend payments.UPS shares currently yield a solid 3.64% and the company’s dividend payments eat up just 43% of the company’s net income at present, so there’s plenty of room for continued growth. While slowing global growth could weigh on package volumes in the near term, UPS has been adept at cutting costs and paying down its debt, resulting in a more efficient company with a stronger balance sheet that will be able to weather any kind of recessionary storm.Hedge fund ownership of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) sank during Q2, as there was a 24% drop in the number of smart money managers long the stock. That continued a longer trend, with the decline in ownership reaching 34% dating back to the third quarter of 2020. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, managed by Michael Larson, owned 740,689 shares of UPS as of June 30.Mayer Capital likes United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)’s growing profit and the company’s plans to distribute that profit to shareholders, as revealed in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“UPS has been a beneficiary of the pandemic-related shift to e-commerce. Revenues increased 15% in the year, with strong leverage in the business boosting operating profit by al- most 67%. Management is focusing on a ‘Better not Bigger’ strategy for the business and divested the UPS Freight business early in the year. Mean- while, the company is expected to increase distributions to shareholders in 2022, from both dividends and share buybacks.”14. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 61 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 10.7% Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) switched to quarterly dividend payments in the final quarter of 2019 and has since raised those payouts by 40% to $1.12. The tech consulting company has a 16-year streak of making dividend payments and a three-year run of dividend growth. Its payout ratio stands at just 37%, while ACN shares yield 1.56%.Not only did Accenture pay out $2.5 billion in dividends during its fiscal 2022, it also repurchased $4.1 billion worth of shares, so the company is richly rewarding shareholders with its growing earnings (up 22% year-over-year to $10.71 during FY22).Hedge fund ownership of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) jumped by 23% during Q1 to hit an all-time high and remained flat during Q2. Hedge funds have been steadily buying into the company in greater numbers, as evidenced by the five straight quarters of ownership growth the stock experienced between Q2 2020 and Q3 2021. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners opened a new stake in ACN during Q2, buying 1.35 million shares.Aristotle Capital Management, which owns 628,965 shares of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) as of June 30, believes the company is well positioned to capitalize on the growing trend towards digital transformation, as detailed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) provides management and technology consulting services and solutions. The company delivers a range of specialized capabilities and solutions to clients across all industries and around the world. Accenture offers a portfolio of management consulting, strategy, digital, technology, interactive and business operations services to some of the leading companies and government organizations.We see digital transformation strategies remain a key initiative for global enterprises and believe Accenture is well-positioned. The company’s IT service and solutions business has an attractive mix to capitalize on digital transformation strategies. We have a positive view on Accenture’s historical success in Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A), which supports the company’s growth through talent acquisition as well as niche technology bolt-ons.”13. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 61 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12.1% Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is in the midst of a nine-year run of dividend growth, highlighted by a 25% raise to its quarterly dividend in 2021. The company’s dividend history is complicated by its split with AbbVie however, which necessitated a lower subsequent payout. The company is otherwise considered a Dividend King, with a 50-year streak of dividend growth.The medical device manufacturer pays out just 33% of its net income in dividends, and its shares carry a 1.89% yield. While Abbott’s adjusted diluted EPS fell by 17.9% to $1.15 during Q3, analysts believe the company can grow that figure by 11% over the next five years, which could sustain continued double digit growth in the company’s dividend.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has consistently remained among the second tier of most popular stocks among hedge funds, routinely hovering around the top 50. Several big money managers have large stakes in the company, including Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management and Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates.Another fund with a big stake in the company is Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital which discussed its bullish stance on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG).Abbott has been working through a recall of its infant formula brand Similac in the US, which has continued to pressure its share price. Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”12. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 69 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12.2% Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has an eight-year run of dividend growth ongoing, which included a 33% hike to its quarterly payments in the second quarter of 2021. The company’s payout ratio is a miniscule 26%, so there’s no shortage of future dividend growth opportunities. ORCL shares currently yield 1.65%. Oracle has a growing cloud business that is proving to be a cash cow for the company, which is expected to pull in $5.01 per share in earnings during its current fiscal year ended May 2023.There has been a rise in hedge fund ownership of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) for six straight quarters, with a 31% increase during that time. Gavin Baker’s Atreides Management opened a position in ORCL during Q2, while Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management did so during Q1.First Eagle Investments, which owns the largest stake in Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) as of June 30 among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey, discussed the company’s strong operations in the First Eagle Investments Global Fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Oracle is one of the world’s largest independent enterprise software companies and has been reinventing itself for the cloud-computing environment, a transition pursued primarily through investments in organic research and design and smallish, well-priced acquisitions. That said, Oracle in June closed its largest-ever deal with the acquisition of Cerner, a designer of software to store and analyze medical records and other healthcare data.Oracle took on additional debt to finance this all-cash acquisition and as a result plans to moderate its stock-buyback program to focus on debt reduction. Despite the weak quarter for the stock, Oracle’s operations remain strong; it reported better- than-expected results for its most recent quarter and issued upbeat guidance for the coming fiscal year.”11. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 70 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12.9% Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) shares have one of the lowest yields among this group of growth stocks at just 1.09%, but there’s nonetheless a lot to like about the future of the pharmaceutical giant’s dividend payments, which have been experiencing accelerating growth over the past few years. LLY grew its dividend by 14.7% in 2020, followed by a 14.8% hike in 2021, and a 15.3% increase this year. The company’s payout ratio is 44%.Eli Lilly boasts a promising pipeline of more than 20 candidates that could fuel future earnings growth and dividend increases. The company’s diabetes medicine Mounjaro alone could be a game changer, with analysts projecting as much as $25 billion in annual sales for the treatment at its peak.Hedge fund ownership of Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) jumped by 32% during Q2 to hit an all-time high. There are now twice as many smart money managers long the stock as there were five years earlier. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owns 5.93 million LLY shares as of June 30, while Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP opened a new stake in the company during Q2.Baron Funds is bullish on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)’s diabetes drug Mounjaro, as it discussed in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment is in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is off to a strong start. In addition, Mounjaro may be approved for obesity next year. In clinical trials, Mounjaro delivered up to 22.5% average weight loss in adults with obesity and has the potential to be a top-selling drug. Lilly also has a drug in development for Alzheimer’s disease in the same class as Lecanemab, a drug being developed by Biogen and Eisai that slowed the rate of cognitive decline in a late-stage clinical trial. Lilly is not facing any significant near-term patent expirations and we think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”10. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 71 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 17.3% AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) has a nine-year run of dividend growth going since its split from Abbott Labs and its dividend has been picking up steam at a rapid pace. The company grew its quarterly payments by 50% between Q4 2017 and Q4 2018, and the dividend has risen by more than 50% on top of that since. The next payment of $1.41 is scheduled for November 15 to shareholders of record as of October 14, and the company’s first payment of 2023 will rise again, to $1.48. ABBV shares yield just over 4%.While AbbVie is set to lose the exclusivity on its blockbuster drug Humira next year, the company already has two growing successors on its heels in the form of Rinvoq and Skyrizi, which grew revenue by 56% and 85% respectively during Q2. AbbVie also has a deep and promising pipeline in facial aesthetics treatments, a market that’s expected to grow at a CAGR of 14% through 2028.The number of funds long AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) has ticked down for the past two quarters, falling by 14% during that period. David Harding’s Winton Capital Management and Anna Nikolayevsky’s Axel Capital Management sold off their ABBV stakes during Q2. Arrowstreet Capital, lead by the team of Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell, held the largest Abbvie stake on June 30 among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database.Baron Funds also discussed AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter, in which it expressed optimism about the company’s drug pipeline:“AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a drug developer best known for Humira, an immunosuppressant that is the best selling drug of all time. Given outsized key product risk (patent cliff and generic launches beginning in 2023), AbbVie has broadened its pipeline, highlighted by its Allergan acquisition. Shares fell on results that missed consensus and indications that legacy franchises were outperforming newer product launches, calling into question AbbVie’s long-term strategy. With promising assets in the pipeline and its robust cash flow profile, we believe AbbVie will grow well into the future.”9. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 72 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 11.1% NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has a 32-year streak of paying dividends and a nine-year run of dividend growth. Since the company’s stock split in 2016, its quarterly dividend payments have grown from $0.16 to $0.305. NKE shares yield a modest 1.3%, but with the company’s growing margins thanks to its digital initiatives and 34% payout ratio, it’s likely that will continue to push higher in the future. In the near term, Nike’s margins are being pressured by a glut of inventory, but sales rose by 10% in the company’s fiscal Q1 when adjusting for currency, which outpaced Nike’s sales growth from FY22.Hedge funds were buying into NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) during Q2 as the stock continued its descent, as there was a 9% uptick in smart money ownership of the company. Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owns the largest NKE stake as of June 30, holding 8.54 million shares. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP sold off 24% of its large Nike position during Q1 and owns 6.73 million shares as of June 30.The RiverPark Large Growth Fund suffered from NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares’ underperformance during Q3, being one of the fund’s top detractors, as outlined in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Nike: NKE shares were a top detractor this quarter on higher inventory balances leading to lower-than-expected gross margins for the next couple of quarters. The company reported 1Q23 sales and EPS beats, but freight costs, markdowns, and the strong dollar weighed on gross margins. Nike continues to expect low double-digit currency-neutral sales growth, but the strong dollar will reduce overall sales growth and discounted inventory will further reduce gross margins for the year.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. After working through its near-term currency and gross margin issues, we expect the company to return towards management’s guidance of at least 10% annual revenue growth, and return to its accelerating profit growth, as longer-term we expect margins to be materially aided by rising average sales prices (from both increased pricing and a mix shift to more premium products), the company’s deep innovation pipeline, a secular shift from the company’s traditional wholesale channels to a more direct-to-consumer approach (now 35% of revenues up from 16% ten years ago), and a more streamlined supply chain. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect the combined gross and operating margin improvements from its initiatives will drive long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”8. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 80 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 17% The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has one of the highest dividend growth rates on this list over the last five years, having more than doubled its dividend payments during that time. The company has a 12-year run of dividend growth and a 45% payout ratio that makes future raises appear to not be an issue. HD shares currently yield 2.54%. Home Depot has a strong balance sheet and should be able to weather any weakness in the housing market, as evidenced by its performance during the financial crisis, when it was still generating a profit during the housing market’s darkest days.Hedge fund ownership of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has jumped for the three straight quarters, increasing by 34% during that time, even as funds have been selling out of the company’s rival Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) in droves. Richard Chilton’s Chilton Investment Company owns one of the most bullish stakes in HD among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database, holding 753,813 shares as of June 30, giving the fund 5.76% 13F exposure to the stock.Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital, which owns 1.26 million The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) shares as of June 30, believes the company is poised to take market share in the professional customer segment, as revealed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a high-quality operator in the home improvement industry. Macroeconomic concerns, particularly the rise in mortgage rates, caused the share price to pull back and trade at a greater discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Home Depot is well positioned to continue gaining share due to its premium real estate locations, strong operations and recent investments in its supply chain. We like Home Depot’s exposure to the professional customer and believe in its ability to take market share in this segment as we believe home improvement spending has the potential to remain resilient in upcoming years.”7. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 82 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12% Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) has raised its quarterly dividend payments by 79% since 2017 and the company’s payout ratio still stands at a miniscule 9%, so similar growth over the next five years is certainly a possibility. DHR shares do sport a tiny yield of 0.40%, but expect that to rise in the years to come.The life sciences company’s sales are slowing rapidly as Covid testing numbers decline, with 2023 revenue growth expected to be just 0.5%. However, longer-term the company has several strong segments that are growing at double-digit rates which will eventually become more visible once Covid testing numbers stabilize or decline enough to no longer offset those gains.Hedge fund ownership of Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) hit an all-time at the end of 2021, with the stock ranking among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds for the first time. The number of funds long DHR has since dipped by 9%. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management and Dan Loeb’s Third Point are among the company’s biggest smart money backers.The Cooper Investors Global Equities Fund is bullish on Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)’s spinoff of its Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions group, as detailed in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Spin-offs have been a valuable source of uncorrelated return for the portfolio since inception, whether investing in them directly or retaining ownership stakes in the spun-off assets of existing holdings. During the quarter Danaher announced the spin of its Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions group (EAS) expected to close in late 2023. Danaher have been masters of the spin over the last decade and once again this one appears to make sense for both parties. The parent becomes a pure-play life sciences and diagnostics business with higher growth, margins and returns plus more M&amp;A firepower. EAS, with leading positions in water quality through assets like Hach, ChemTreat and Trojan will, as a standalone business, have a more focused M&amp;A strategy and represent an attractive water-related exposure for ESG focused funds. The spinco will still operate with the highly regarded Danaher Business System though (like ‘Fortive Business System’) we expect this to get rebranded while still delivering outstanding financial results.”6. UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 91 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 17.7% Closing out the first part of our list is UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), which has been growing its dividend at an impressive rate for several years, pushing its yield up to 1.2%. Its quarterly dividend payments have more than doubled since 2017, including growing by 13.8% earlier this year to $1.65. The managed care insurer grew adjusted diluted EPS by 28.1% year-over-year in Q3 to $5.79, and has significant secular tailwinds that should allow it to continue growing earnings and expanding its margins. With a payout ratio of just 29%, UNH is well positioned to pay out heftier dividends in the years to come.UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) hit triple digits in hedge fund ownership for the first time in Q4 2018 and reached an all-time high of 110 in Q2 of 2021.

Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management owns 2.87 million shares.Carillon Tower Advisers noted that the defensive aspects of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)’s managed care business helped the company perform well relative to the market in Q2, as discussed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported solid quarterly results and raised 2022 guidance modestly. Additionally, managed care is another industry that is viewed as defensive in the current environment, which helped support UnitedHealth and its peer group.”Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

(NYSE:NKE) institutional owners may be pleased with recent gains after 43% loss over the past year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-inc-nyse-nke-institutional-140020712.html,1667138420,STORY,['NKE'],"[If you want to know who really controls NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 68% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 6.0% increase in share prices after a year of 43% losses as a sign that returns are likely to begin trending higher.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of NIKE, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for NIKE ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NIKE?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in NIKE. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NIKE's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in NIKE. Our data suggests that Philip Knight, who is also the company's Top Key Executive, holds the most number of shares at 17%. When an insider holds a sizeable amount of a company's stock, investors consider it as a positive sign because it suggests that insiders are willing to have their wealth tied up in the future of the company. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.7% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 16 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of NIKEThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.It seems insiders own a significant proportion of NIKE, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$147b, and insiders have US$29b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to access this free chart showing recent trading by insiders.General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in NIKE. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

There are many things that retirees must do in order to ensure that their golden years will be financially comfortable. IRAs, a 401k, HSAs, annuities, pensions, current earnings, and expected age at retirement are just a few of the items to consider. However, it all comes down to picking smart stocks, for those in the investing game.Investors have a lot to think about to be sure. But one of the best market strategies is to start early and identify dependable stocks that can withstand downturns. Generally, that means companies that provide investors with dividends, that help contribute income to one’s portfolio during difficult times for capital appreciation. Those dividends also offer a dual benefit. They can be taken directly as income, or be reinvested into new shares which can see capital appreciation over time (and provide even more dividends). All in all, dividend investing is a great strategy to begin at any age. Although, the earlier one starts, the more said dividend can compound over time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are seven smart stocks to buy for investors looking to build out an income-rich retirement.VFCVF Corp.$27.42ENBEnbridge$39.05TNCTennant$58.27SONSonoco$63.27DCIDonaldson$56.07AAPLApple$114.80BRK.BBerkshire Hathaway$289.88VF Corp. (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comStarting our list of smart stocks income investors may want to consider is VF Corp. (NYSE:VFC). This company probably won’t ring too many bells for readers. The company’s name is rather non-descript unless you’re familiar with it, and its business is not a household name. But VF Corp. is actually one of the world’s largest apparel and footwear firms, with multiple household brand names within its portfolio. These names include Vans, Dickies, Timberland, Supreme, and The North Face, among others. Indeed, VF Corp. is certainly worth considering for the purpose of generating retirement income. That’s because VFC stock provides a dividend yield of around 7%. In the world of income investing, that’s very high. Story continuesThat yield is as high as it is because VFC share prices have declined significantly in 2022, falling from $73 to just $27. The company also reduced its 2023 outlook in late-September as macroeconomic concerns continued to mount. However, VF Corp. also expects compound annual revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits through the fiscal year 2027. Buy in now, reinvest those dividends at lower share prices, and let compounding work its magic. Enbridge (ENB)Enbridge (ENB) sign on the head Enbridge office in Toronto, Canada.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comOne of the smart stocks every long-term income investor should own is Enbridge (NYSE:ENB). This company operates in the pipeline transport business. That makes it very different than VF Corp in terms of industry. However, both firms offer a dividend yielding more than 7%. In Enbridge’s case, that dividend yields 7.25%, at the time of writing. That makes both stocks appealing to investors seeking an income-rich retirement. Enbridge is an Alberta, Canada-based energy firm rooted in a pragmatic approach to a changing energy landscape. Enbridge plans to optimize its existing pipeline throughput, while modernizing its infrastructure. The company is accelerating its investment in natural gas projects, and developing export markets at the same time. In short, the evolution of energy won’t occur overnight. Pipelines will remain valuable, and their utilization rates will taper very slowly. Accordingly, the long-term narrative for Enbridge is solid despite the threats provided by alternative and renewable energy sources. That is reflected in the company’s recent earnings. The company’s EBITDA, cash flows, and earnings per share all increased or remained flat through the first half of this year. As a result, the company reaffirmed its 2022 guidance.   Tennant (TNC)Someone cleaning a kitchen table with a spray bottle and towel.. AERCSource: Maridav/ShutterStock.comTennant (NYSE:TNC) is a 150-year-old company that manufactures and sells floor cleaning equipment and supplies. In short, it’s a boring company. Boring is good for income investors. That’s true because mature firms like Tennant that dominate mature niche sectors tend to have less competition. The barriers Tennant has built are tough to break down, and the company’s slow growth makes doing so unappealing. The result is Tennant provides consistent and stable returns, and should maintain its dominant position for the foreseeable future. So, in order to entice investors, Tennant pays an ultra-reliable dividend. That dividend, while yielding a modest 1.7%, hasn’t been reduced since 1972. Tennant continues growing at a modest pace. In Q2, revenues reached $280.2 million, representing 4.4% organic growth. Organic growth measures the value of inflows (assets/revenue) versus the value of outflows of assets/revenues. So, Tennant was essentially 4.4% stronger in Q2 2022 than it was a year prior. Sonoco (SON)A photo of various food packaging containers.Source: Pixel-Shot / Shutterstock.comSonoco (NYSE:SON) is a company that I would certainly classify as one of the smart stocks to own for income investors. This company manufactures industrial and consumer product packaging. Those packaging products have end markets in everything from the automotive sector to construction, appliances, textiles, and more. As with other stocks on this list, Sonoco’s dividend provides steady, meaningful income. Sonoco declared a 49-cent dividend on Oct. 19 which represented the 390th consecutive quarter in which the company did so. That means the company has been paying a dividend dating back to 1925, and that dividend hasn’t been reduced dating back to 1981. A strong income investing strategy relies on simple principles. Identify mature firms that have been successfully doing something for a long time, and uses that cash to pay investors. Sonoco, like the other firms listed here, adheres to those principles. Sonoco’s business will fluctuate. Q2 earnings prove that. Revenues reached $1.91 billion in that period. That was a 38% increase over Q2 2021. Importantly, the company continued to pay dividends despite EPS losses of $3.34 in Q2 of last year. Donaldson (DCI)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comDonaldson (NYSE:DCI) is another stock that represents the antithesis of get-rich-quick investing. The filtration company’s 10-year returns exemplify that notion, providing 5.81% annualized average returns over the last decade. Those returns were modestly higher than the 4.81% from the New York Stock Exchange during that same period. Importantly, those returns don’t include the effect of Donaldson’s dividend, which currently yields around 1.7%. The company has reduced its dividend since 1996, meaning investors can rely on it. Further, Donaldson’s dividend sports a 5.1% growth rate over the last 5 years. In short, Donaldson beats the NYSE broadly, includes a dividend that increases that return, and is rapidly increasing that dividend. The firm’s Q2 earnings report states it plainly: “In fiscal 2022, Donaldson eclipsed $3 billion in sales, delivered record profits despite the challenging operating environment, and returned $281 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.” Expect more of the same moving forward. Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock represents a clear departure from the other stocks on this list. It isn’t a very old company relative to those above. It’s a technology company, not a consumer staples play, and it isn’t particularly known for its dividend. All of these factors mean it doesn’t pop up on retirement stock lists often. Perhaps that should change. Many readers may already be aware that Apple does provide a dividend. It amounts to just over 23 cents per quarter currently. That amounts to a yield of 0.6% given Apple’s current stock price. That said, the company is growing rapidly and boasts a 9.5% 5-year growth rate. Expect Apple to continue to increase its dividend. One day, it will transition into a mature dividend stock. For now, it’s a great pick that does well in most business cycles. Apple just reported earnings, which is still being interpreted by the market. Despite lower-than-expected iPhone sales, the company’s top and bottom line both saw beats.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)A Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) sign sits out front of an office in Lafayette, Indiana.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comLast on our list of smart stocks to buy for an income-rich retirement is a company that doesn’t pay a dividend at all. That said, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) has often been described as the ultimate retirement stock. It is a diversified holdings company run by Warren Buffett who is often considered the greatest investor of all time. Berkshire Hathaway doesn’t provide a dividend, making it an anomaly on this list. What the company does is invest in primarily American firms that are undervalued. Those firms often provide dividends, which Buffett’s firm reinvests into purchasing additional shares. The company was known early on to invest in insurance firms, but its current holdings represent a diverse swath of U.S. industry, with Apple dominating its portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway has provided annualized average returns of 11.39% over the last decade. That resulted in a given sum of capital nearly tripling in value over the period. BRK.B shares have dropped from $300 to around $290 at the time of writing. That’s a reasonable testament to the strength of the company’s strategy, given that broad indexes have fallen more than 20%. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Although prices were relatively low, insiders chose to sell US$1.0m worth of stock in the past 12 months. This could be a sign of impending weakness.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo Wells Fargo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, Kleber Santos, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$44.44 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$46.35). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was 51% of Kleber Santos's holding. Kleber Santos was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Wells Fargo insiders own 0.08% of the company, currently worth about US$132m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Wells Fargo Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no Wells Fargo insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Wells Fargo insiders selling. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Wells Fargo you should know about.But note: Wells Fargo may not be the best stock to buy.

Selling at an average price of US$51.22, which is higher than the current price might have been the right call as holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Pfizer Pfizer Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the , John Young, for US$7.5m worth of shares, at about US$50.16 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$47.43. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Insiders in Pfizer didn't buy any shares in the last year.

While the Occupy Wall Street protests initially began as a way to oppose the level of money involved in politics and income inequality, with references to the elite 1% holding much of the country's wealth, their ire soon turned to banks and major corporations. However, the protests did not sustain and, after beginning in 2011, faded by 2012.After the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the world, lockdowns were imposed in most countries around the globe and economies came to a standstill, with most business either shut down, or running on a vastly reduced scale. This led to companies laying of millions across the globe, with the hardest hit industries such as the travel industry laying off the most people, with major companies such as The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL) and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) each laying off thousands of employees. Many companies also considered this an opportunity to lay off employees and reduce costs despite record profits, with World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:WWE) one of such companies, laying off dozens of talent despite being at its most profitable.Most Admired Companies in the world in 2022However, the pandemic provided an opportunity to employees which resulted in an improvement in work-life balance in their lives. Many are now refusing to work unless it's completely remote, citing the reduced expenses because of not having to commute, not to mention the invaluable time saved. As the economy rebounded, many businesses realized that they needed more employees to run operations smoothly, only for employees to have realized their self-worth in the meanwhile and not being willing to go back to work under the same conditions that they'd been subjected to earlier. This has also led to the Great Resignation, an ongoing economic trend where employees are resigning en masse, starting in April 2021, where in the United States, more than four million resigned from their jobs, followed by 3.9 million resignations in June 2021.Story continuesThe demand of the employees is similar regardless of class, background and level of experience; better work-life balance, more flexibility and better compensation. According to a study carried out by PwC, 65% of employees said they were looking for a new job while 88% of executives admitted that the rate of turnover in their companies was higher than normal.Companies seem to be coming to the realization that the days of employee loyalty is over, as it should be, and that they need to do a lot more to improve relations between executives and employees. Further, companies are also significantly under fire due to their contributions to climate change. A 2017 report by the Guardian stated that just 100 companies across the world were responsible for 71% of global emissions, which the companies try to cover by attempting to transfer the onus to regular people, as if they're not to blame. In an effort to improve their image, many companies, including of course the most admired companies in the world, are attempting to rectify their contribution to climate change, often pledging to become carbon neutral or at least significantly reducing their carbon emissions over the next decade or two.The most admired companies in the world are also some of the most recognizable. These companies have long realized the importance of retaining and attracting top talent and creating and maintaining and image that has won them plaudits all over the world. We have used Fortune's annual ranking based on corporate reputation for 2021, with the rankings determined from responses from more than 3,700 executives, directors and analysts. These rankings don't insinuate that these are the most ethical companies free from any misdeeds plaguing them, which we'll cover more when talking about each company, but are simply an indication of the reputation and standing of the company. This is why some medical companies have climbed within the list since they've been on the forefront in the battle against the deadliest pandemic in a century. However, while we've chosen the top 20 from Fortune, we have then checked Google Trend statistics for each company. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the most admired companies in the world, starting with number 20:20. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was one of the first pharmaceutical companies to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, which has been essential and integral in allowing the resumption of normal activities across the globe. While Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was nowhere near the top 20 in the previous year, now it kicks off the list of most admired companies in the world as it led by example, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has perhaps been integral in dissipating some of the mistrust the general population has towards the biggest pharmaceutical companies.19. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the biggest conglomerates in the United States. While Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been much maligned for cancer causing talc-based baby powder and was ordered to pay $2.1 billion to the plaintiffs, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was one of the few companies to develop a valid Covid-19 vaccine, which was instrumental in curbing the pandemic.18. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is famous for selling quality items for lower prices and has gained admirers for its focus on sustainability and environmental, social and governance issues by setting measurable goals with the aim to to improve consistently. One of Target Corporation's (NYSE:TGT) recent initiatives includes investing $100 million into Black communities in an effort to combat racism and racial inequality.17. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) being considered an admired company will definitely rankle some feathers. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has faced a ton of lawsuits based on poor working conditions, low wages, poor health care and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) being involved in antiunion activities. The fact that it's still in this list speaks volumes about the disconnect between executives and average employees.16. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Topping the list of the most admired companies in the world for Fortune is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), though it only made it to 16th position in our list.  Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is constantly recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the world as well. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has topped every category used by Fortune in its determination including use of corporate assets, innovation, social responsibility, financial soundness, quality of management, quality of products and services and global competitiveness.15. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A)Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), run by the legendary Warren Buffett, is admired primarily because of the way its been run by the famous investor. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A) is the largest financial services company in the world by revenue.14. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the most well-known companies in the world. In fact, odds are if you're reading this article on a laptop, you're using Microsoft Windows to run your computer! Regularly rated as one of the best places to work at, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) encourages creativity and is held in high regards by its employees.13. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is one of the biggest chains in the world, with more than 33,000 stores globally. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) also pays full time tuition for all eligible partners in Arizona State University's online program, with more than 1,000 Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) partners having graduated through the program. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) aims to have more than 25,000 partners obtain a degree from ASU by 2025. However, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has also opposed the formation of unions.12. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)The most admired delivery company in the world, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has been a part of Fortune's list for at least 22 years. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has more than 850,000 employees worldwide, and despite allegations of distributed substances and narcotics not to mention allegations of tax evasion, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has still been able to maintain its view as an admired company.11. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the few major retailers which has actually been praised by current and ex-employees. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) may not have unions in the majority of locations but 15,000 employees are union members. Further, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has continuously raised the minimum wage of its workers, which is now $16 an hour.10. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the most popular streaming platforms in the world today, with more than 220 million subscribers across the globe. While making the list of the most admired companies in the world, it is unlikely that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be maintaining its ranking considering its poor performance recently losing subscribers while letting go 300 employees in June. Netflix Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has also seen its share price decline by 61% YTD in 2022.9. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) being among the most admired companies in the world is definitely going to be controversial, what with the internet being full of stories of the way Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) mistreats its workers, busts unions and tries to stifle worker rights in multiple instances, the truth is that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is still really admired because of its innovation for customers, support for communities and commitment to the environment. Of course, it's worth noting that it is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) itself which has mentioned the above reasons.8. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)One of the biggest sports goods manufacturers in the world, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has an incredibly strong brand reputation and brand loyalty, which has served it through decades. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)  is also famous for its innovation and creativity, though it does need to do more in terms of social responsibility.7. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL)While Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) infamously became the face of poor customer service after it dragged off a doctor from the plane in 2017, but to its credit, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) did reviews its policies after the incident to improve upon services provided.6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is the most admired media and entertainment company in the world.

However, if you’re going to hold forever, quality counts. For this reason, I’m going with the S&amp;P 500.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTo narrow my choices to seven, I’ve limited my selections to the companies that have grown their dividends per share by more than 10% in the past 18 months. Further, I’ve picked one stock from seven different sectors to provide some diversification.I do not doubt that these seven dividend stocks to buy and hold forever will get the job done, delivering more than adequate long-term returns for investors.Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold: Electronic Arts (EA)Electronic Arts logo on a wallSource: Rick Neves / Shutterstock.comWith the June 2022 dividend payment, Electronic Arts  (NASDAQ:EA) raised its dividend by 11.8% to  19 cents a share. The annual payment of 76 cents yields a low 0.60%. Why am I selecting a stock that yields less than 1%?Potential capital appreciation, that’s why. Over the past 10 years, EA generated an annualized total return of 26.2%, more than double the U.S. market.As I write this on Oct. 25, Electronic Arts is days away from announcing its second quarter 2023 quarterly results. Analyst estimates suggest it will probably deliver lower revenues and earnings from Q2 2022.Not to worry, you’re buying EA stock to buy and hold forever.On Oct. 7, Electronic Arts launched its new EA app for Windows. It replaces Origin on PC, which started way back in  2011. The company listened to feedback from the gaming community before moving the replacement out of its beta phase.“The EA app is our fastest and lightest PC client to date,” the company stated in its blog post announcing the launch.Story continuesThe 30 analysts covering EA stock give it an overweight rating with a $153 target price.Pool Corporation (POOL)Yellow pool float, ring floating in a refreshing blue swimming poolSource: ShutterstockWith the  May 2022 dividend payment, Pool Corporation  (NASDAQ:POOL) raised its dividend by 25.0% to $1 a share. The annual payment of $4 yields a reasonable 1.4%. In April, Charlie Bilello listed the top 20 performing S&amp;P 500 stocks over the past five, 10, 15, and 20 years. POOL made the 10-year list, up 1,215%. Over the past five years, it has had an annualized total return of 20.2%, more than double the U.S. market.And that’s despite a year-to-date total return of nearly 48%.Pool Corp. is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pools and related outdoor living products. It has more than 410 sales centers on three continents.The company reported  Q3 2022 earnings on Oct. 20, which included going over $5 billion in YTD sales, with the fourth quarter still playing out.“We’ve observed increased demand for higher value products and customizations for new pools and remodeling projects, even though the issuance of new pool permits year-to-date has moderated,” stated CEO Peter D. Arvan in its Q3 2022 press release.Over the years, I’ve learned one thing: If you own a house with a pool, you’re not going to sell it if you don’t maintain it. It’s that simple.The  11 analysts covering POOL stock give it an overweight rating with a $350 target price.Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold: Brown-Forman (BF-B)Person holding cellphone with logo of American spirits company Brown-Forman (BF-B) Corporation on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comWith the Dec. 28, 2021 dividend payment, Brown-Forman  (NYSE:BF-B) raised its dividend by 5.0% to $0.1885 a share. The annual payment of 75 cents yields a reasonable 1.1%. I know what you’re thinking. You’re wondering why the maker of Jack Daniel’s and many other fine alcoholic beverages made the cut when it increased the dividend by less than 10%.A day later, on Dec. 29, 2021, it paid a  special dividend of $1 a share, making the total payout $1.1885 a share, 562% higher than the regular payment of $0.1795.I’m a big fan of special dividends. As far back as 2012, I’m on record endorsing the capital allocation practice. It’s an example of a shareholder-friendly company.In early October, Brown-Forman made a big announcement. It was buying Venezuela rum brand Diplomático. While no terms were revealed, the move makes the company a leader in the super-premium rum category.Diplomático’s top markets include the U.S. and Germany. It is sold in more than 100 countries worldwide. To date, Brown-Forman didn’t own a rum brand. This puts in a very upscale crowd.The  20 analysts covering BF-B stock give it a hold rating with a $73.06 target price.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum  (NYSE:OXY) raised its dividend by 1,200% with the April 2022 payment of $0.13 a share. The annual payment of 52 cents yields a low 0.70%. When the oil and gas producer announced the increase in February, it pointed out that it would continue to grow the quarterly dividend as its balance sheet strengthened. It is part of CEO Vicki Hollub’s plan to reward shareholders like Warren Buffett for sticking with it.OXY stock had a good year in the markets. It’s up more than 128% YTD. That puts it up for the past five years. It last traded this high in November 2018.Occidental reports Q3 2022 results on Nov. 9. It is expected to earn $2.50 a share in the third quarter. The analyst estimate for all of 2022 is  $10.22 a share. That’s less than 7x earnings.Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) owns 26.8% of its stock, including  83.9 million warrants to buy shares — with authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to buy up to 50% of the company. Assuming the warrants are exercised, Berkshire would earn more than $141 million in annual dividends from its investment.The  28 analysts covering OXY stock give it a hold rating with a $73.93 target price. The analysts might not like it, but the Oracle of Omaha sure does.Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold: T. Rowe Price (TROW)T row price (TROW) logo magnified through a lens while displayed on a web browserSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comT. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) raised its dividend by 11.1% with the March 2022 payment to $1.20 a share. The annual payment of $4.80 yields a high 4.4%. A year ago, in July, T. Rowe Price paid a juicy $3 a share special dividend.Sure, its stock is down more than 44% YTD and 48% over the past year, but if you have owned TROW stock since June 2021, you’ve collected $9.84 in dividends over 17 months.I’ll take that every day of the week and twice on Sundays.There’s not much T. Rowe Price can do when the markets are in correction mode. When you’re an asset manager in down times, you can only hope that the markets turn higher at some point.In mid-October, the company reported its month-end assets for September. They were  $1.23 trillion, with outflows in the third quarter of $24.6 billion. YTD’s outflows were $44.6 billion, or just 3.6% of its assets under management.The  15 analysts covering TROW stock give it an underweight rating with a $95.50 target price.While the analysts don’t like it, it is still expected to earn $7.87 in 2022. That’s less than 14x earnings. Further, the company’s current earnings yield — the inverse of the P/E ratio — is  9.93%, the highest it’s been in the past decade.Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy StatusSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comFreeport-McMoRan  (NYSE:FCX) raised its dividend by 100.0% with the February 2022 payment to $0.15 a share. The annual payment of 60 cents yields a reasonable 1.9%.  The company’s stock price jumped on Oct. 20 after the company announced better-than-expected Q3 2022 results.Due to a 30% decline in copper prices since March, the company’s third-quarter profit fell by 71% to $404 million from $1.4 billion a year ago. On a per-share basis, it earned 28 cents a share in the quarter, two cents better than the consensus estimate.Despite the negative view by investors about copper, the company has said that demand remains very strong. CEO Richard Adkerson stated in FCX’s Q3 2022 press release:“Despite near-term uncertainties, the long-term market fundamentals and value opportunities for our stakeholders remain highly attractive. I am confident that our strategy centered on being Foremost in Copper will be positive for all stakeholders as global conditions improve.”The  21 analysts covering FCX stock give it an overweight rating with a $35.98 target price.Down nearly 24% YTD, FCX remains well below its 52-week high of $51.99.Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold: Extra Space Storage (EXR)Extra Space Storage (EXR) facility exterior and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comExtra Space Storage  (NYSE:EXR) raised its dividend by 20.0% with the March 2022 payment to $1.50 a share.

""Beer as a category is very resilient.""AB-InBev produces everything from good old affordable Bud Light to more premium priced non-beers such as CutWater.Doukeris says not only haven't beer sales waned this year, consumers don't appear to be trading down to cheaper alternatives.""Not yet — globally, we don't see this,"" Doukeris said when asked about consumers trading down overall. ""Premiumization as a trend continues to grow and is doing well. You think about our global brands, more premium brands, this quarter they grew very well, led by Corona, that grew revenues 23.5%, while we grew revenues 12%, a little bit above that in the quarter. So more premium beers continue to move. It's almost unstoppable trend I think in the category. A lot of headroom to continue to premiumize.""A fan carries a four tray full of Budweiser beer during the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia group F match between Germany and Sweden at Fisht Stadium on June 23, 2018 in Sochi, Russia. (Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images)To Doukeris' point, AB-InBev saw sales of the often higher priced Corona rise 23.5% in the third quarter — a faster clip than the company's total revenue increase of 12.1%. And the company's Beyond Beer segment, comprised mostly of various hard seltzers and beer alternatives, rose 10% from a year ago.AB-InBev also managed to surpass most analyst estimates for the third quarter on the back of demand for higher priced offerings.Here is how AB-Inbev performed compared to Wall Street forecasts:Total Sales: $15.09 billion vs. $15.15 billionOrganic Revenue Growth: +12.1% vs. +10.8%Adjusted EBITDA: $5.31 billion vs. $5.32 billionAdjusted EPS: $0.81 vs. $0.77AB-InBev stock is up 1% in the past month.""Strong beat and raise emblematic of commercial momentum,"" Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein, who has an Outperform rating on AB-InBev shares with a $70 price target, wrote in a client note after the the company's results. ""Further, guidance raise suggests high visibility on costs and continued strong demand in most markets with limited if any trade down and a new round of pricing coming in the U.S. and Europe.

The figure rose 2.6% and outpaced the 2.3% forecast. But perhaps the most significant data point was the Fed’s own inflation gauge, which fell from 7.3% to 4.2%. While market watchers expect the Fed to raise rates again in its November meeting, there is some speculation that the central bank may start slowing down its rate hike policy as early as December.In response to all of this, markets jumped on Friday. The S&amp;P 500 gained more than 2.4%, and the Dow Jones added almost 200 points. Looking at the market's reaction, Jim Cramer, the well-known host of CNBC’s ‘Mad Money’ program, says: “This market’s trading like [this] week we’ll see some real signs that the Fed’s winning its war on inflation, and they can, therefore, ease up on the rate hikes going forward... I wouldn’t be at all surprised if the market got it exactly right.” While investors are seeing a clear ray of hope on the horizon, the risk of recession remains high. Given these conditions, Cramer is recommending two airline stocks for investors, as he sees travel in a ‘recession resistant’ position. In his words, “People aren’t shifting from online to in-person shopping. They’re going places. They’re doing things.” The result is strength for the travel industry as the post-COVID consumer wants to get out and about. And that translates to hot travel demand.So let’s take a closer look at the airline stocks Cramer is recommending. We’ve opened up the TipRanks database to pull their latest stats, and we’ll add in recent commentary from the Street’s analysts. Both are Buy-rated, and both show double-digit upside potential. Here are the details.Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL)The first Cramer Pick we're looking at is Delta Air Lines, one of the largest ‘legacy carriers’ in the airline industry. Delta, based in Atlanta, Georgia, operates some 4,000 daily flights to more than 275 destinations around the world, including more than 500 weekly flights to various European destinations. The company  boasts a market cap of more than $22 billion, and brought in $29.9 billion in revenue last year. In the last 9 financial quarters, Delta has posted 7 sequential revenue gains, marking a strong rebound from the COVID pandemic shutdowns.Story continuesA large part of Delta’s revenue improvements came in the second and third quarters of this year, when the top line jumped from Q1’s $9.4 billion to $13.8 billion in Q2 and just under $14 billion for Q3, a company record. The jump in revenues came as consumers shift their spending to experiences rather than stuff, and travel is a major beneficiary of that shift. Delta’s CEO described the summer travel season as ‘hectic.’In addition to high revenues, the airline reported a second quarter in a row positive earnings, showing that the switch from net loss in Q1 to net gain in Q2 has some staying power. Adjusted EPS in Q3 came in at $1.51, just under the $1.53 forecast but well above the $1.44 EPS posted in Q2.On a negative note, Delta reported a 48% increase in fuel costs during Q3, an indication that the airline is not immune to inflationary effects. Balancing this, the company is predicting further revenue growth in 4Q22, a positive cash flow balance for 2022, and up to $4 billion in annual free cash flow by 2024.In coverage for Morgan Stanley, analyst Ravi Shanker sees an upbeat future for Delta and writes: “We remain bullish the Airline space overall and DAL is one of our preferred ways to play the upside... DAL’s results, guide and  call reinforced this positive view on the topline and dispelled any notion of cracks in demand. We expect to get further reinforcement of the booking curve into the holiday season (and into January) through the rest of airline earnings.""""While inflation is persistent (as it is for the rest of the economy), the operating leverage that DAL will see as demand comes back into a network that is already resourced up to receive it, should help offset the inflation,” Shanker added.Given all of the above, Shanker has high hopes. Along with an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, he keeps a $65 price target on the stock. This target puts the upside potential at 87%. (To watch Shanker’s track record, click here)It’s clear from the Strong Buy consensus rating that the Street in on board with the bulls here – all 10 of the recent analyst reviews are positive, making that rating unanimous. The stock is trading for $34.67 and its $45.70 average price target suggests a gain of ~32% on the one-year timeframe. (See DAL stock forecast on TipRanks)United Airlines Holdings (UAL)Next on our list of ‘Cramer picks’ is Chicago-based United Airlines, another of the industry’s major legacy carriers, and with a $14 billion market cap, a legitimate giant of a corporation. United Airlines is North America’s largest passenger air carrier, and has more 3,100 daily flights to 400 US and international destinations. The company operates out of the major air hubs in Chicago, Houston, and San Francisco, and maintains a fleet of more than 800 aircraft.United has been showing steady revenue gains since the COVID crisis of 2020, and in Q2 and Q3 of this year those gains accelerated. The company’s Q1 revenue was $7.6 billion, up more than double year-over-year, but revenue in Q2 hit $12.1 billion and in Q3, released in mid-October, it hit $12.9 billion. The Q3 result was up 65% y/y, and up 13% from the pre-pandemic 3Q19.United’s earnings switched from negative to positive in Q2 of this year, and in Q3 the adjusted EPS of $2.81 beat the forecast of $2.28, and is up dramatically from the $1.02 EPS loss in Q3 of last year. United’s management is crediting the sharp gains in revenue and earnings to a surge in travel; the company’s CEO says that demand is strong now that workers are ‘untethered from the desk.’This airline has attracted attention from Raymond James’ industry expert Savanthi Syth, who says of United: “We continue to believe 2023 revenue is likely to hold up better than for most U.S. peers due to outsized exposure to large corporate and international travel (still recovering), with somewhat unique cost tailwinds including the restoration of the widebody fleet that further stabilizes the operation, international capacity growth, and lower regional cost headwind (vs. American).”To this end, Syth gives UAL shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, along with a $55 price target that indicates room for ~26% gain going forward into next year. (To watch Syth’s track record, click here)Overall, United’s stock has picked up 8 recent analyst reviews, and these include 6 Buys, 1 Hold, and 1 Sell for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $43.72 and its $56.13 average target suggests a potential upside of ~28% in the coming months.

(NYSE:PNC) shares last year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/more-money-bank-insiders-divested-140028693.html,1667138428,STORY,['PNC'],"[The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.'s (NYSE:PNC) stock rose 4.2% last week, but insiders who sold US$3.4m worth of stock over the last year are probably in a more advantageous position. Selling at an average price of US$187, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best move for these insiders because their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PNC Financial Services GroupThe Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking, Michael Lyons, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$183 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$163. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of PNC Financial Services Group shares, than buying. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At PNC Financial Services Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at PNC Financial Services Group. Specifically, Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking Michael Lyons ditched US$584k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of PNC Financial Services GroupLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. PNC Financial Services Group insiders own about US$229m worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About PNC Financial Services Group Insiders?An insider hasn't bought PNC Financial Services Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. But since PNC Financial Services Group is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most admired companies in the world.It seems that most companies are facing a reckoning right now. While corporations have often been lambasted because of their capitalistic nature and lack of regard for employees and the general population in lieu of massive profits, the protests against companies seem to have only amplified since the pandemic began. While the Occupy Wall Street protests initially began as a way to oppose the level of money involved in politics and income inequality, with references to the elite 1% holding much of the country's wealth, their ire soon turned to banks and major corporations. However, the protests did not sustain and, after beginning in 2011, faded by 2012.After the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the world, lockdowns were imposed in most countries around the globe and economies came to a standstill, with most business either shut down, or running on a vastly reduced scale. This led to companies laying of millions across the globe, with the hardest hit industries such as the travel industry laying off the most people, with major companies such as The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL) and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) each laying off thousands of employees. Many companies also considered this an opportunity to lay off employees and reduce costs despite record profits, with World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:WWE) one of such companies, laying off dozens of talent despite being at its most profitable.Most Admired Companies in the world in 2022However, the pandemic provided an opportunity to employees which resulted in an improvement in work-life balance in their lives. Many are now refusing to work unless it's completely remote, citing the reduced expenses because of not having to commute, not to mention the invaluable time saved. As the economy rebounded, many businesses realized that they needed more employees to run operations smoothly, only for employees to have realized their self-worth in the meanwhile and not being willing to go back to work under the same conditions that they'd been subjected to earlier. This has also led to the Great Resignation, an ongoing economic trend where employees are resigning en masse, starting in April 2021, where in the United States, more than four million resigned from their jobs, followed by 3.9 million resignations in June 2021.Story continuesThe demand of the employees is similar regardless of class, background and level of experience; better work-life balance, more flexibility and better compensation. According to a study carried out by PwC, 65% of employees said they were looking for a new job while 88% of executives admitted that the rate of turnover in their companies was higher than normal.Companies seem to be coming to the realization that the days of employee loyalty is over, as it should be, and that they need to do a lot more to improve relations between executives and employees. Further, companies are also significantly under fire due to their contributions to climate change. A 2017 report by the Guardian stated that just 100 companies across the world were responsible for 71% of global emissions, which the companies try to cover by attempting to transfer the onus to regular people, as if they're not to blame. In an effort to improve their image, many companies, including of course the most admired companies in the world, are attempting to rectify their contribution to climate change, often pledging to become carbon neutral or at least significantly reducing their carbon emissions over the next decade or two.The most admired companies in the world are also some of the most recognizable. These companies have long realized the importance of retaining and attracting top talent and creating and maintaining and image that has won them plaudits all over the world. We have used Fortune's annual ranking based on corporate reputation for 2021, with the rankings determined from responses from more than 3,700 executives, directors and analysts. These rankings don't insinuate that these are the most ethical companies free from any misdeeds plaguing them, which we'll cover more when talking about each company, but are simply an indication of the reputation and standing of the company. This is why some medical companies have climbed within the list since they've been on the forefront in the battle against the deadliest pandemic in a century. However, while we've chosen the top 20 from Fortune, we have then checked Google Trend statistics for each company. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the most admired companies in the world, starting with number 20:20. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was one of the first pharmaceutical companies to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, which has been essential and integral in allowing the resumption of normal activities across the globe. While Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was nowhere near the top 20 in the previous year, now it kicks off the list of most admired companies in the world as it led by example, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has perhaps been integral in dissipating some of the mistrust the general population has towards the biggest pharmaceutical companies.19. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the biggest conglomerates in the United States. While Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been much maligned for cancer causing talc-based baby powder and was ordered to pay $2.1 billion to the plaintiffs, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was one of the few companies to develop a valid Covid-19 vaccine, which was instrumental in curbing the pandemic.18. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is famous for selling quality items for lower prices and has gained admirers for its focus on sustainability and environmental, social and governance issues by setting measurable goals with the aim to to improve consistently. One of Target Corporation's (NYSE:TGT) recent initiatives includes investing $100 million into Black communities in an effort to combat racism and racial inequality.17. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) being considered an admired company will definitely rankle some feathers. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has faced a ton of lawsuits based on poor working conditions, low wages, poor health care and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) being involved in antiunion activities. The fact that it's still in this list speaks volumes about the disconnect between executives and average employees.16. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Topping the list of the most admired companies in the world for Fortune is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), though it only made it to 16th position in our list.  Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is constantly recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the world as well. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has topped every category used by Fortune in its determination including use of corporate assets, innovation, social responsibility, financial soundness, quality of management, quality of products and services and global competitiveness.15. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A)Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), run by the legendary Warren Buffett, is admired primarily because of the way its been run by the famous investor. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A) is the largest financial services company in the world by revenue.14. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the most well-known companies in the world. In fact, odds are if you're reading this article on a laptop, you're using Microsoft Windows to run your computer! Regularly rated as one of the best places to work at, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) encourages creativity and is held in high regards by its employees.13. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is one of the biggest chains in the world, with more than 33,000 stores globally. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) also pays full time tuition for all eligible partners in Arizona State University's online program, with more than 1,000 Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) partners having graduated through the program. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) aims to have more than 25,000 partners obtain a degree from ASU by 2025. However, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has also opposed the formation of unions.12. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)The most admired delivery company in the world, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has been a part of Fortune's list for at least 22 years. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has more than 850,000 employees worldwide, and despite allegations of distributed substances and narcotics not to mention allegations of tax evasion, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has still been able to maintain its view as an admired company.11. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the few major retailers which has actually been praised by current and ex-employees. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) may not have unions in the majority of locations but 15,000 employees are union members. Further, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has continuously raised the minimum wage of its workers, which is now $16 an hour.10. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the most popular streaming platforms in the world today, with more than 220 million subscribers across the globe. While making the list of the most admired companies in the world, it is unlikely that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be maintaining its ranking considering its poor performance recently losing subscribers while letting go 300 employees in June. Netflix Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has also seen its share price decline by 61% YTD in 2022.9. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) being among the most admired companies in the world is definitely going to be controversial, what with the internet being full of stories of the way Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) mistreats its workers, busts unions and tries to stifle worker rights in multiple instances, the truth is that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is still really admired because of its innovation for customers, support for communities and commitment to the environment. Of course, it's worth noting that it is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) itself which has mentioned the above reasons.8. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)One of the biggest sports goods manufacturers in the world, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has an incredibly strong brand reputation and brand loyalty, which has served it through decades. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)  is also famous for its innovation and creativity, though it does need to do more in terms of social responsibility.7. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL)While Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) infamously became the face of poor customer service after it dragged off a doctor from the plane in 2017, but to its credit, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) did reviews its policies after the incident to improve upon services provided.6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is the most admired media and entertainment company in the world. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has been admired in several areas including people management, use of corporate assets, social responsibility, quality of management and quality of products and services. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) seems to have a new lease on life with the launch of Disney+, which has been a massive success so far.Please continue to see the 5 Most Admired Companies in the World.Suggested articles:15 Most Valuable British Companies10 Biggest Publishing Companies in the World 15 Most Valuable Indian Tech Companies In The WorldDisclosure: None. 20 most admired companies in the world is originally published at Insider Monkey. ]"

140,97e7a3c5-8715-31fd-82cc-7c5d983ad88a,SBAC,2022-10-31,12 Best Real Estate Stocks to Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-real-estate-stocks-125913214.html,1667221153,STORY,"['WPC', 'O', 'EQR', 'STAG', 'WELL', 'SBAC', 'AMT', 'PSA-PM', 'EQIX']","[In this article, we discuss the 12 best real estate stocks to buy now. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Best Real Estate Stocks to Buy Now.Real estate stocks are known for insulating an investment portfolio against rising inflation. Inflation grew by 8.2% YoY during September 2022 in the US, surpassing a four-decade high recorded earlier in the year. Although the US Federal Reserve has increased benchmark interest rates five times in 2022, the increase in inflation is showing minimal signs of slowing down and coming close to the Fed’s target of 2%. During such times, the best real estate stocks offer safe long-term investment opportunities to shareholders with attractive dividend yields. Furthermore, these real estate companies lease out the properties owned by them and enjoy the benefit of a regular increase in rent. The rent increase is usually indexed against the consumer price index (CPI), which aids these companies in growing their income in line with the inflation levels.A majority of the best real estate stocks are structured as real estate investment trusts (REITs).

Companies that have done so for 25 consecutive years are crowned Dividend Aristocrats, and there are 65 such companies on the S&amp;P 500.  Then there are the Dividend Kings, which have raised their annual payouts for at least 50 consecutive years.While those companies usually rank among the safest dividend stocks to own and are likely to continue growing their dividends at a modest pace in the years to come, many of them have relatively modest dividend growth rates in the single digits.To find some of the fastest growing dividend stocks of large cap companies often requires looking outside those vaunted lists.

(NYSE:UPS), which has grown its dividend at a CAGR of 11.3% over the last five years. Much of that growth came this year, when UPS jacked its quarterly dividend payments by nearly 50% to $1.52. UPS has a 12-year run of dividend growth going, in addition to a 21-year run of dividend payments.UPS shares currently yield a solid 3.64% and the company’s dividend payments eat up just 43% of the company’s net income at present, so there’s plenty of room for continued growth. While slowing global growth could weigh on package volumes in the near term, UPS has been adept at cutting costs and paying down its debt, resulting in a more efficient company with a stronger balance sheet that will be able to weather any kind of recessionary storm.Hedge fund ownership of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) sank during Q2, as there was a 24% drop in the number of smart money managers long the stock. That continued a longer trend, with the decline in ownership reaching 34% dating back to the third quarter of 2020. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, managed by Michael Larson, owned 740,689 shares of UPS as of June 30.Mayer Capital likes United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)’s growing profit and the company’s plans to distribute that profit to shareholders, as revealed in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“UPS has been a beneficiary of the pandemic-related shift to e-commerce. Revenues increased 15% in the year, with strong leverage in the business boosting operating profit by al- most 67%. Management is focusing on a ‘Better not Bigger’ strategy for the business and divested the UPS Freight business early in the year. Mean- while, the company is expected to increase distributions to shareholders in 2022, from both dividends and share buybacks.”14. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 61 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 10.7% Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) switched to quarterly dividend payments in the final quarter of 2019 and has since raised those payouts by 40% to $1.12. The tech consulting company has a 16-year streak of making dividend payments and a three-year run of dividend growth. Its payout ratio stands at just 37%, while ACN shares yield 1.56%.Not only did Accenture pay out $2.5 billion in dividends during its fiscal 2022, it also repurchased $4.1 billion worth of shares, so the company is richly rewarding shareholders with its growing earnings (up 22% year-over-year to $10.71 during FY22).Hedge fund ownership of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) jumped by 23% during Q1 to hit an all-time high and remained flat during Q2. Hedge funds have been steadily buying into the company in greater numbers, as evidenced by the five straight quarters of ownership growth the stock experienced between Q2 2020 and Q3 2021. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners opened a new stake in ACN during Q2, buying 1.35 million shares.Aristotle Capital Management, which owns 628,965 shares of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) as of June 30, believes the company is well positioned to capitalize on the growing trend towards digital transformation, as detailed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) provides management and technology consulting services and solutions. The company delivers a range of specialized capabilities and solutions to clients across all industries and around the world.

The company’s IT service and solutions business has an attractive mix to capitalize on digital transformation strategies. We have a positive view on Accenture’s historical success in Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A), which supports the company’s growth through talent acquisition as well as niche technology bolt-ons.”13. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 61 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12.1% Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is in the midst of a nine-year run of dividend growth, highlighted by a 25% raise to its quarterly dividend in 2021. The company’s dividend history is complicated by its split with AbbVie however, which necessitated a lower subsequent payout. The company is otherwise considered a Dividend King, with a 50-year streak of dividend growth.The medical device manufacturer pays out just 33% of its net income in dividends, and its shares carry a 1.89% yield. While Abbott’s adjusted diluted EPS fell by 17.9% to $1.15 during Q3, analysts believe the company can grow that figure by 11% over the next five years, which could sustain continued double digit growth in the company’s dividend.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has consistently remained among the second tier of most popular stocks among hedge funds, routinely hovering around the top 50. Several big money managers have large stakes in the company, including Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management and Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates.Another fund with a big stake in the company is Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital which discussed its bullish stance on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG).Abbott has been working through a recall of its infant formula brand Similac in the US, which has continued to pressure its share price. Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”12. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 69 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12.2% Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has an eight-year run of dividend growth ongoing, which included a 33% hike to its quarterly payments in the second quarter of 2021. The company’s payout ratio is a miniscule 26%, so there’s no shortage of future dividend growth opportunities. ORCL shares currently yield 1.65%. Oracle has a growing cloud business that is proving to be a cash cow for the company, which is expected to pull in $5.01 per share in earnings during its current fiscal year ended May 2023.There has been a rise in hedge fund ownership of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) for six straight quarters, with a 31% increase during that time. Gavin Baker’s Atreides Management opened a position in ORCL during Q2, while Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management did so during Q1.First Eagle Investments, which owns the largest stake in Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) as of June 30 among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey, discussed the company’s strong operations in the First Eagle Investments Global Fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Oracle is one of the world’s largest independent enterprise software companies and has been reinventing itself for the cloud-computing environment, a transition pursued primarily through investments in organic research and design and smallish, well-priced acquisitions. That said, Oracle in June closed its largest-ever deal with the acquisition of Cerner, a designer of software to store and analyze medical records and other healthcare data.Oracle took on additional debt to finance this all-cash acquisition and as a result plans to moderate its stock-buyback program to focus on debt reduction. Despite the weak quarter for the stock, Oracle’s operations remain strong; it reported better- than-expected results for its most recent quarter and issued upbeat guidance for the coming fiscal year.”11. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 70 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12.9% Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) shares have one of the lowest yields among this group of growth stocks at just 1.09%, but there’s nonetheless a lot to like about the future of the pharmaceutical giant’s dividend payments, which have been experiencing accelerating growth over the past few years. LLY grew its dividend by 14.7% in 2020, followed by a 14.8% hike in 2021, and a 15.3% increase this year. The company’s payout ratio is 44%.Eli Lilly boasts a promising pipeline of more than 20 candidates that could fuel future earnings growth and dividend increases. The company’s diabetes medicine Mounjaro alone could be a game changer, with analysts projecting as much as $25 billion in annual sales for the treatment at its peak.Hedge fund ownership of Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) jumped by 32% during Q2 to hit an all-time high. There are now twice as many smart money managers long the stock as there were five years earlier. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owns 5.93 million LLY shares as of June 30, while Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP opened a new stake in the company during Q2.Baron Funds is bullish on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)’s diabetes drug Mounjaro, as it discussed in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment is in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is off to a strong start. In addition, Mounjaro may be approved for obesity next year. In clinical trials, Mounjaro delivered up to 22.5% average weight loss in adults with obesity and has the potential to be a top-selling drug. Lilly also has a drug in development for Alzheimer’s disease in the same class as Lecanemab, a drug being developed by Biogen and Eisai that slowed the rate of cognitive decline in a late-stage clinical trial. Lilly is not facing any significant near-term patent expirations and we think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”10. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 71 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 17.3% AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) has a nine-year run of dividend growth going since its split from Abbott Labs and its dividend has been picking up steam at a rapid pace. The company grew its quarterly payments by 50% between Q4 2017 and Q4 2018, and the dividend has risen by more than 50% on top of that since. The next payment of $1.41 is scheduled for November 15 to shareholders of record as of October 14, and the company’s first payment of 2023 will rise again, to $1.48. ABBV shares yield just over 4%.While AbbVie is set to lose the exclusivity on its blockbuster drug Humira next year, the company already has two growing successors on its heels in the form of Rinvoq and Skyrizi, which grew revenue by 56% and 85% respectively during Q2. AbbVie also has a deep and promising pipeline in facial aesthetics treatments, a market that’s expected to grow at a CAGR of 14% through 2028.The number of funds long AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) has ticked down for the past two quarters, falling by 14% during that period. David Harding’s Winton Capital Management and Anna Nikolayevsky’s Axel Capital Management sold off their ABBV stakes during Q2.

(NYSE:ABBV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter, in which it expressed optimism about the company’s drug pipeline:“AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a drug developer best known for Humira, an immunosuppressant that is the best selling drug of all time. Given outsized key product risk (patent cliff and generic launches beginning in 2023), AbbVie has broadened its pipeline, highlighted by its Allergan acquisition. Shares fell on results that missed consensus and indications that legacy franchises were outperforming newer product launches, calling into question AbbVie’s long-term strategy. With promising assets in the pipeline and its robust cash flow profile, we believe AbbVie will grow well into the future.”9. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 72 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 11.1% NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has a 32-year streak of paying dividends and a nine-year run of dividend growth.

NKE shares yield a modest 1.3%, but with the company’s growing margins thanks to its digital initiatives and 34% payout ratio, it’s likely that will continue to push higher in the future. In the near term, Nike’s margins are being pressured by a glut of inventory, but sales rose by 10% in the company’s fiscal Q1 when adjusting for currency, which outpaced Nike’s sales growth from FY22.Hedge funds were buying into NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) during Q2 as the stock continued its descent, as there was a 9% uptick in smart money ownership of the company. Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owns the largest NKE stake as of June 30, holding 8.54 million shares.

(NYSE:NKE) shares’ underperformance during Q3, being one of the fund’s top detractors, as outlined in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Nike: NKE shares were a top detractor this quarter on higher inventory balances leading to lower-than-expected gross margins for the next couple of quarters. The company reported 1Q23 sales and EPS beats, but freight costs, markdowns, and the strong dollar weighed on gross margins. Nike continues to expect low double-digit currency-neutral sales growth, but the strong dollar will reduce overall sales growth and discounted inventory will further reduce gross margins for the year.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. After working through its near-term currency and gross margin issues, we expect the company to return towards management’s guidance of at least 10% annual revenue growth, and return to its accelerating profit growth, as longer-term we expect margins to be materially aided by rising average sales prices (from both increased pricing and a mix shift to more premium products), the company’s deep innovation pipeline, a secular shift from the company’s traditional wholesale channels to a more direct-to-consumer approach (now 35% of revenues up from 16% ten years ago), and a more streamlined supply chain. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect the combined gross and operating margin improvements from its initiatives will drive long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”8. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 80 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 17% The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has one of the highest dividend growth rates on this list over the last five years, having more than doubled its dividend payments during that time. The company has a 12-year run of dividend growth and a 45% payout ratio that makes future raises appear to not be an issue. HD shares currently yield 2.54%. Home Depot has a strong balance sheet and should be able to weather any weakness in the housing market, as evidenced by its performance during the financial crisis, when it was still generating a profit during the housing market’s darkest days.Hedge fund ownership of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has jumped for the three straight quarters, increasing by 34% during that time, even as funds have been selling out of the company’s rival Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) in droves. Richard Chilton’s Chilton Investment Company owns one of the most bullish stakes in HD among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database, holding 753,813 shares as of June 30, giving the fund 5.76% 13F exposure to the stock.Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital, which owns 1.26 million The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) shares as of June 30, believes the company is poised to take market share in the professional customer segment, as revealed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a high-quality operator in the home improvement industry. Macroeconomic concerns, particularly the rise in mortgage rates, caused the share price to pull back and trade at a greater discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Home Depot is well positioned to continue gaining share due to its premium real estate locations, strong operations and recent investments in its supply chain. We like Home Depot’s exposure to the professional customer and believe in its ability to take market share in this segment as we believe home improvement spending has the potential to remain resilient in upcoming years.”7. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 82 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12% Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) has raised its quarterly dividend payments by 79% since 2017 and the company’s payout ratio still stands at a miniscule 9%, so similar growth over the next five years is certainly a possibility. DHR shares do sport a tiny yield of 0.40%, but expect that to rise in the years to come.The life sciences company’s sales are slowing rapidly as Covid testing numbers decline, with 2023 revenue growth expected to be just 0.5%. However, longer-term the company has several strong segments that are growing at double-digit rates which will eventually become more visible once Covid testing numbers stabilize or decline enough to no longer offset those gains.Hedge fund ownership of Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) hit an all-time at the end of 2021, with the stock ranking among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds for the first time. The number of funds long DHR has since dipped by 9%. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management and Dan Loeb’s Third Point are among the company’s biggest smart money backers.The Cooper Investors Global Equities Fund is bullish on Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)’s spinoff of its Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions group, as detailed in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Spin-offs have been a valuable source of uncorrelated return for the portfolio since inception, whether investing in them directly or retaining ownership stakes in the spun-off assets of existing holdings. During the quarter Danaher announced the spin of its Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions group (EAS) expected to close in late 2023. Danaher have been masters of the spin over the last decade and once again this one appears to make sense for both parties. The parent becomes a pure-play life sciences and diagnostics business with higher growth, margins and returns plus more M&amp;A firepower. EAS, with leading positions in water quality through assets like Hach, ChemTreat and Trojan will, as a standalone business, have a more focused M&amp;A strategy and represent an attractive water-related exposure for ESG focused funds. The spinco will still operate with the highly regarded Danaher Business System though (like ‘Fortive Business System’) we expect this to get rebranded while still delivering outstanding financial results.”6. UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 91 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 17.7% Closing out the first part of our list is UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), which has been growing its dividend at an impressive rate for several years, pushing its yield up to 1.2%. Its quarterly dividend payments have more than doubled since 2017, including growing by 13.8% earlier this year to $1.65. The managed care insurer grew adjusted diluted EPS by 28.1% year-over-year in Q3 to $5.79, and has significant secular tailwinds that should allow it to continue growing earnings and expanding its margins. With a payout ratio of just 29%, UNH is well positioned to pay out heftier dividends in the years to come.UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) hit triple digits in hedge fund ownership for the first time in Q4 2018 and reached an all-time high of 110 in Q2 of 2021. Ownership of the stock has dipped by 17% in the four quarters since then. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners owns the largest UNH stake among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database, holding 3.11 million shares on June 30. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management owns 2.87 million shares.Carillon Tower Advisers noted that the defensive aspects of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)’s managed care business helped the company perform well relative to the market in Q2, as discussed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported solid quarterly results and raised 2022 guidance modestly. Additionally, managed care is another industry that is viewed as defensive in the current environment, which helped support UnitedHealth and its peer group.”Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

The two converted funds are the BrandywineGLOBAL–Dynamic US Large Cap Value ETF (NASDAQ: DVAL) and the Martin Currie Sustainable International Equity ETF (NASDAQ: MCSE). Brandywine Global Investment Management, LLC and Martin Currie Inc. are specialist investment managers of Franklin Templeton.""These two funds represent our first mutual-fund-to-ETF conversions,"" said Patrick O’Connor, Head of Global ETFs for Franklin Templeton. ""Leveraging the deep expertise and focus of our independent specialist investment managers, these two funds have historically delivered exceptional results and diversification potential for clients. Now we are excited to continue to offer these investment strategies within the attractive and popular ETF vehicle.""The conversions were first announced in December 2021, and the firm received shareholder approval in June 2022. The two ETFs will be managed in a substantially similar manner as the previous mutual funds. Each ETF will retain its existing investment objective, principal investment strategy, primary subadviser and portfolio management team.DVAL, BrandywineGLOBAL–Dynamic US Large Cap Value ETF, seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing in US equities using a quantitative approach. The fund normally invests at least 80% of its net assets in the equity securities of US large capitalization companies.MCSE, Martin Currie Sustainable International Equity ETF, strives to provide long-term capital appreciation by investing in equity and equity-related securities of foreign companies.

You can find this and other information in each prospectus, or summary prospectus, if available, at www.franklintempleton.com. Please read it carefully.Prior to close of business on October 28, 2022, the Funds referenced operated as open-end mutual funds. The Funds have an identical investment goal and substantially similar investment strategies as the predecessor mutual funds.All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.BrandywineGLOBAL–Dynamic US Large Cap Value ETF Risks:Equity securities are subject to price fluctuation and possible loss of principal. The value approach to investing involves the risk that stocks may remain undervalued. Value stocks may underperform the overall equity market while the market concentrates on growth stocks. The manager’s investment style may become out of favor and/or the manager’s selection process may prove incorrect, which may have a negative impact on the Fund’s performance.Martin Currie Sustainable International Equity ETF Risks:Equity securities are subject to price fluctuation and possible loss of principal. Small- and mid-cap stocks involve greater risks and volatility than large-cap stocks. The fund may be significantly overweight to underweight certain companies, industries or market sectors, which may cause the fund's performance to be more sensitive to developments affecting those companies, industries or sectors. International investments are subject to special risks including currency fluctuations, as well as social, economic and political uncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. To the extent the fund focuses its investments in a single country or only a few countries in a particular geographic region, economic, political, regulatory or other conditions affecting such country or region may have a greater impact on fund performance relative to a more geographically diversified fund. The managers’ environmental social and governance (ESG) strategies may limit the types and number of investments available and, as a result, may forego favorable market opportunities or underperform strategies that are not subject to such criteria. ESG factors or criteria are subjective and qualitative, and the analysis by the manager may not always accurately assess ESG practices of a security or issuer, or reflect the opinions of other investors or advisors. There is no guarantee that the strategy's ESG directives will be successful or will result in better performance and may not work as intended. Derivatives, such as options and futures, can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on fund performance. In addition to the fund's operating expenses, the fund will indirectly bear the operating expenses of any underlying funds. The fund is classified as ""non-diversified,"" which means it may invest a larger percentage of its assets in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund. To the extent the fund invests its assets in a smaller number of issuers, the fund will be more susceptible to negative events affecting those issuers than a diversified fund.ETFs trade like stocks, fluctuate in market value and may trade at prices above or below their net asset value. Brokerage commissions and ETF expenses will reduce returns. ETF shares may be bought or sold throughout the day at their market price (MP), not their Net Asset Value (NAV), on the exchange on which they are listed. Shares of ETFs are tradable on secondary markets and may trade either at a premium or a discount to their NAV on the secondary market. Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the fund are ""created"" at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units. Each ""creator"" or ""Authorized Participant"" enters into an authorized participant agreement with Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc, an affiliate of the fund's sponsor, Franklin Holdings, LLC. Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units directly with the fund. Retail investors buy and sell shares of ETFs at market price (not NAV) in the secondary market throughout the trading day.

That’s not to say that a safe stock will never see a decline – but safe stocks for retirement are more likely to withstand the negative pressures in a poor economic climate.Because these are retirement stocks, we’re also looking for companies that pay a decent dividend. Quarterly or monthly dividend payments are great sources of passive revenue for an investor in retirement.For this list, I use my Portfolio Grader exclusive tool to find the best stocks to buy. The Portfolio Grader evaluates stocks on their fundamentals, such as sales growth and operating margin, and also factors in buying pressure and quantitative factors to determine a letter grade. Just like school, an “A” stock is the best and an “F” stock is at the bottom of the barrel.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBased on the Portfolio Grader rankings, here are seven safe stocks for retirement to buy to help secure that happy retirement.ARLPAlliance Resource Partners$23.81BSMBlack Stone Minerals $17.99GLPGlobal Partners$29.82AMRAlpha Metallurgical Resources$169.31GPCGenuine Parts Company$174.30MNRLBrigham Minerals$30.95AITApplied Industrial Technologies$121.21Alliance Resource Partners (ARLP)A magnifying glass zooms in on the logo for Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (ARLP)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAlliance Resource Partners (NASDAQ:ARLP) is a top coal producer in the eastern U.S. As a master limited partnership, ARLP has the tax benefits of private partnerships as well as the liquidity of publicly traded companies.Alliance is doing a credible job of trying to diversify its business, investing in EV charging station company Francis and electric motor manufacturer Infinitum Electric.Coal is still king of ARLP, though. The company scored big with second-quarter earnings, posting revenue of $616.5 million and earnings per share of $1.23, beating estimates of $563.14 million and EPS of 94 cents – and that performance certainly helps its grade.Story continuesARLP stock is up big in 2022 – more than 80%, and it pays a dividend yield of nearly 6.8%. ARLP has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Black Stone Minerals (BSM)Production operator communicate between central control room by using radio to operate ball valve at offshore oil and gas processing platform for control gases and liquid crude oil process. Energy Stocks. CEI stockSource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.comBlack Stone Minerals (NYSE:BSM) is a bet on high oil prices. And while the price of oil is less than $90 right now, it’s still high – and there’s a solid case to be made that oil prices will stay there.First, consider the global pressures. Saudi Arabia shocked the White House by cutting oil production just before the midterm election – Washington believed that it had struck a deal to boost oil production before the Saudis reportedly backed out. Analysts now expect the price of oil to remain steady at least through the end of the year.That bodes well for BSM stock, which is up 72% so far this year. Second-quarter earnings were also solid, with revenue of $180.37 million and EPS of 41 cents beating estimates of $138.85 million and EPS of 40 cents. And on top of that, Black Stone pays a dividend yield of more than 10%.As long as the price of oil remains high, Black Stone will benefit from inflated profit margins. BSM stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Global Partners (GLP)High gas prices in the U.S. President Biden is considering a gas tax holiday.Source: Laura Gangi Pond / Shutterstock.comHigh oil prices are also giving Global Partners (NYSE:GLP) oversized earnings these days. The gasoline wholesaler and retailer is up 25% so far this year and has increased by 27% since mid-June.The improved cash position gave Global Partners the money it needed to purchase Tidewater Convenience, which allowed it to increase its footprint in the mid-Atlantic.GLP’s revenue in the second quarter was a whopping $5.32 billion or 62% more than a year ago. Net income of $160.64 million and EPS of $4.61 was also a massive improvement on a year-over-year basis.GLP stock also pays a dividend yield of 8.2%, helping push its Portfolio Grader rating to an “A.”Alpha Metallurgical Resources (AMR)A top aerial view of an open pit mine industry, with a big yellow mining truck for coalSource: ShutterstockAlpha Metallurgical Resources (NYSE:AMR) isn’t a household name, but it’s a solid pick if you’re looking for safe stocks to buy for your retirement.Alpha Metallurgical Resources is a major producer of metallurgical coal, which is a grade of coal that can be used to produce coke – not the drink, but the critical component for steelmaking. AMR has 21 mines around the world to churn out coke to make high-quality steel.Maybe you aren’t excited about that business – but if that’s the case, you’ve missed out on some pretty exciting returns. AMR stock is up nearly 170% so far this year. Revenue in the second quarter was $1.34 billion, which was a 238% increase from a year ago.AMR stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Genuine Parts Company (GPC)Person wearing red shoes stepping down on car brake.Source: Nor Gal / ShutterstockIf you want a safe dividend stock, it would hard to find something that fits the bill as well as Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC). The high price of even used automobiles has people keeping their cars longer than ever these days – the average new car buyer is keeping their car for 8.4 years.That means plenty of preventative maintenance – or even some overhauls – to keep older cars on the road. That should help GPC stock keep the profits rolling in. Earnings for the third quarter did just that, with revenue of $5.38 billion and EPS of $2.23 beating top- and bottom-line estimates of $5.37 million in revenue and $2.05 EPS.GPC stock is also a dividend aristocrat, as it raised its dividend payout for 66 consecutive years. You won’t get rich with the 2.1 dividend yield, but it’s consistent and that’s all you need from a safe retirement stock.GPC stock is up 22% so far this year, and it has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Brigham Minerals (MNRL)Offshore oil rig near Harlingen, Nederlande. Oil producing is a major economic factor in the Netherlands.Source: travelview / Shutterstock.comAnother energy stock to consider for your retirement is Brigham Minerals (NYSE:MNRL), a Texas company that makes its money by buying oil and gas mineral and royalty interests. It has oil and gas mineral rights in Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, Wyoming and North Dakota.But the company won’t be around for much longer. In September, Brigham agreed to a merger with Sitio Royalties (NYSE:STR) in an all-stock transaction that is expected to close early next year. Brigham shareholders will receive 1.133 shares of STR stock for each share of MNRL they hold.After the merger, Sitio will be one of the biggest publicly traded mineral and royalty company in the U.S.But for now, MNRL is still being traded and is a solid way to get in on the new company. MRNL stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Applied Industrial Technologies (AIT)workers on a construction site with the sun setting in the backgroundSource: ShutterstockFormerly known as the Ohio Ball Bearing Company, Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE:AIT) makes bearings, power transmission products, power components and systems and other industrial products. It handles everything from power transmissions to seals and fluid power systems and hoses.Many of its products are critical for motor vehicles – which we established earlier are being kept longer than ever by their owners thanks to the increase in prices for used autos. If someone is going to keep their car running, they’re going to need the types of products that Applied Industrial is making.The company has consistently been a good earnings performer, which helps its rating in the Portfolio Grader. For the fiscal fourth quarter 2022, revenue of $1.06 billion was better than analysts’ expectations for $977.43 million. EPS of $2.02 was better than the expected EPS of $1.66.AIT stock is also doing much better than the overall market, showing a 13% gain in 2022. Add in a dividend yield of 1.16 that nonetheless has increased for 12 consecutive years, and you get a stock that has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier has positions in ARPL, BSM, GLP, AMR, MNRL and AIT.

All of the test results were negative, according to a spokesman, who said Disney is working on plans to reopen.Story continuesVideos circulating on China's Twitter-like Weibo, which could not be independently verified, showed people rushing to the park's gates, which were already locked. Videos of people fleeing malls and office buildings for fear of being locked-in have become commonplace on Chinese social media this year.Rising case numbers from outbreaks across China have prompted a tightening of local curbs and lockdowns, including in parts of cities such as the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, as the economic toll of zero-COVID mounts.Data released on Monday showed that Chinese factory activity unexpectedly fell in October, dragged down by softening global demand and strict domestic COVID-19 curbs, which hit production, travel and shipping in the world's second-largest economy.COVID OUTLIERChina has shown little sign of laying groundwork that would enable it to retreat from a COVID policy that it says saves lives and that has made it an outlier as much of the rest of the world tries to live with the coronavirus.At this month's twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress, President Xi Jinping reiterated China's commitment to zero-COVID, disappointing investors and countless Chinese frustrated by lockdowns, travel curbs and testing.""We don't expect the zero-COVID policy to be abandoned until 2024, which means virus disruptions will keep in-person services activity subdued,"" Zichun Huang, economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.New cases in mainland China hit 2,898 on Sunday, topping 2,000 for a second straight day, a tiny number by global standards.In Guangzhou, one of China's biggest cities, the number of new locally transmitted cases totalled 1,110 from Oct. 24-30, up from 402 in the previous seven-day period, with the district of Haizhu, home to 1.8 million people, under lockdown.A Guangzhou resident named Ye said he was sent to a suburban quarantine hotel after being told on Thursday that he was deemed a close contact by virtue of walking on the same street three days earlier around the same time as someone who tested positive.""I do not know how they calculated that. Also there is no room for you to query or dispute it,"" said Ye, an artist in his 50s.FLARE-UPSOver the past week, authorities have raced to get a handle on rising cases in cities across China, including Datong, Xining, Nanjing, Xian, Zhengzhou and Wuhan, forcing temporary lockdown measures.Du Fan, 40, founder of Wuhan Small Animals Protection Association, which won praise from animal lovers during the pandemic's first lockdown in the central city in early 2020, said his residential compound had been locked down on Saturday.""My biggest worry at the moment is that if this continues for too much longer, I'm afraid we won't be able to continue rescuing the animals, because there's no way to carry out a lot of work,"" he said.In the Chinese-controlled territory of Macau, authorities reinstated curbs including locking down a major casino over the weekend after a handful of cases were detected. Macau had been COVID-free for more than three months.However, in Beijing the Universal Resort theme park reopened on Monday after being shut last week because one visitor had tested positive for coronavirus.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most admired companies in the world.It seems that most companies are facing a reckoning right now. While corporations have often been lambasted because of their capitalistic nature and lack of regard for employees and the general population in lieu of massive profits, the protests against companies seem to have only amplified since the pandemic began. While the Occupy Wall Street protests initially began as a way to oppose the level of money involved in politics and income inequality, with references to the elite 1% holding much of the country's wealth, their ire soon turned to banks and major corporations. However, the protests did not sustain and, after beginning in 2011, faded by 2012.After the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the world, lockdowns were imposed in most countries around the globe and economies came to a standstill, with most business either shut down, or running on a vastly reduced scale. This led to companies laying of millions across the globe, with the hardest hit industries such as the travel industry laying off the most people, with major companies such as The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL) and American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) each laying off thousands of employees. Many companies also considered this an opportunity to lay off employees and reduce costs despite record profits, with World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:WWE) one of such companies, laying off dozens of talent despite being at its most profitable.Most Admired Companies in the world in 2022However, the pandemic provided an opportunity to employees which resulted in an improvement in work-life balance in their lives. Many are now refusing to work unless it's completely remote, citing the reduced expenses because of not having to commute, not to mention the invaluable time saved. As the economy rebounded, many businesses realized that they needed more employees to run operations smoothly, only for employees to have realized their self-worth in the meanwhile and not being willing to go back to work under the same conditions that they'd been subjected to earlier. This has also led to the Great Resignation, an ongoing economic trend where employees are resigning en masse, starting in April 2021, where in the United States, more than four million resigned from their jobs, followed by 3.9 million resignations in June 2021.Story continuesThe demand of the employees is similar regardless of class, background and level of experience; better work-life balance, more flexibility and better compensation. According to a study carried out by PwC, 65% of employees said they were looking for a new job while 88% of executives admitted that the rate of turnover in their companies was higher than normal.Companies seem to be coming to the realization that the days of employee loyalty is over, as it should be, and that they need to do a lot more to improve relations between executives and employees. Further, companies are also significantly under fire due to their contributions to climate change. A 2017 report by the Guardian stated that just 100 companies across the world were responsible for 71% of global emissions, which the companies try to cover by attempting to transfer the onus to regular people, as if they're not to blame. In an effort to improve their image, many companies, including of course the most admired companies in the world, are attempting to rectify their contribution to climate change, often pledging to become carbon neutral or at least significantly reducing their carbon emissions over the next decade or two.The most admired companies in the world are also some of the most recognizable. These companies have long realized the importance of retaining and attracting top talent and creating and maintaining and image that has won them plaudits all over the world. We have used Fortune's annual ranking based on corporate reputation for 2021, with the rankings determined from responses from more than 3,700 executives, directors and analysts. These rankings don't insinuate that these are the most ethical companies free from any misdeeds plaguing them, which we'll cover more when talking about each company, but are simply an indication of the reputation and standing of the company. This is why some medical companies have climbed within the list since they've been on the forefront in the battle against the deadliest pandemic in a century. However, while we've chosen the top 20 from Fortune, we have then checked Google Trend statistics for each company. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the most admired companies in the world, starting with number 20:20. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was one of the first pharmaceutical companies to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, which has been essential and integral in allowing the resumption of normal activities across the globe. While Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) was nowhere near the top 20 in the previous year, now it kicks off the list of most admired companies in the world as it led by example, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has perhaps been integral in dissipating some of the mistrust the general population has towards the biggest pharmaceutical companies.19. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the biggest conglomerates in the United States. While Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been much maligned for cancer causing talc-based baby powder and was ordered to pay $2.1 billion to the plaintiffs, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was one of the few companies to develop a valid Covid-19 vaccine, which was instrumental in curbing the pandemic.18. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is famous for selling quality items for lower prices and has gained admirers for its focus on sustainability and environmental, social and governance issues by setting measurable goals with the aim to to improve consistently. One of Target Corporation's (NYSE:TGT) recent initiatives includes investing $100 million into Black communities in an effort to combat racism and racial inequality.17. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) being considered an admired company will definitely rankle some feathers. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has faced a ton of lawsuits based on poor working conditions, low wages, poor health care and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) being involved in antiunion activities. The fact that it's still in this list speaks volumes about the disconnect between executives and average employees.16. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Topping the list of the most admired companies in the world for Fortune is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), though it only made it to 16th position in our list.  Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is constantly recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the world as well. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has topped every category used by Fortune in its determination including use of corporate assets, innovation, social responsibility, financial soundness, quality of management, quality of products and services and global competitiveness.15. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A)Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), run by the legendary Warren Buffett, is admired primarily because of the way its been run by the famous investor. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A) is the largest financial services company in the world by revenue.14. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the most well-known companies in the world. In fact, odds are if you're reading this article on a laptop, you're using Microsoft Windows to run your computer! Regularly rated as one of the best places to work at, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) encourages creativity and is held in high regards by its employees.13. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is one of the biggest chains in the world, with more than 33,000 stores globally. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) also pays full time tuition for all eligible partners in Arizona State University's online program, with more than 1,000 Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) partners having graduated through the program. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) aims to have more than 25,000 partners obtain a degree from ASU by 2025. However, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has also opposed the formation of unions.12. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)The most admired delivery company in the world, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has been a part of Fortune's list for at least 22 years. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has more than 850,000 employees worldwide, and despite allegations of distributed substances and narcotics not to mention allegations of tax evasion, FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) has still been able to maintain its view as an admired company.11. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the few major retailers which has actually been praised by current and ex-employees. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) may not have unions in the majority of locations but 15,000 employees are union members. Further, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has continuously raised the minimum wage of its workers, which is now $16 an hour.10. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the most popular streaming platforms in the world today, with more than 220 million subscribers across the globe. While making the list of the most admired companies in the world, it is unlikely that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be maintaining its ranking considering its poor performance recently losing subscribers while letting go 300 employees in June. Netflix Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has also seen its share price decline by 61% YTD in 2022.9. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) being among the most admired companies in the world is definitely going to be controversial, what with the internet being full of stories of the way Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) mistreats its workers, busts unions and tries to stifle worker rights in multiple instances, the truth is that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is still really admired because of its innovation for customers, support for communities and commitment to the environment. Of course, it's worth noting that it is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) itself which has mentioned the above reasons.8. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)One of the biggest sports goods manufacturers in the world, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has an incredibly strong brand reputation and brand loyalty, which has served it through decades. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)  is also famous for its innovation and creativity, though it does need to do more in terms of social responsibility.7. Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL)While Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) infamously became the face of poor customer service after it dragged off a doctor from the plane in 2017, but to its credit, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) did reviews its policies after the incident to improve upon services provided.6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is the most admired media and entertainment company in the world. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has been admired in several areas including people management, use of corporate assets, social responsibility, quality of management and quality of products and services. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) seems to have a new lease on life with the launch of Disney+, which has been a massive success so far.Please continue to see the 5 Most Admired Companies in the World.Suggested articles:15 Most Valuable British Companies10 Biggest Publishing Companies in the World 15 Most Valuable Indian Tech Companies In The WorldDisclosure: None. 20 most admired companies in the world is originally published at Insider Monkey. ]"

157,37a398d0-156a-3555-987c-1e6d3cb327c7,CMCSA,2022-10-31,Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) institutional owners may be pleased with recent gains after 36% loss over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcast-corporation-nasdaq-cmcsa-institutional-130031743.html,1667221231,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[If you want to know who really controls Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 85% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Last week's US$3.6b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 36% losses.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Comcast, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Comcast ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Comcast?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Comcast. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Comcast, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Comcast is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Capital Research and Management Company with 9.9% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 9.3% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.4% of the company stock. In addition, we found that Brian Roberts, the CEO has 0.8% of the shares allocated to their name.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 19 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of ComcastWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Comcast Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$1.2b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 13% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Comcast , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

If you want to explore similar companies, you can also take a look at Top 5 Life Insurance Companies In The World.Life Insurance Industry: An AnalysisThe life insurance industry is a vital part of the financial services sector in the United States. It helps provide financial security for families in the event of the death of a breadwinner, and also offers a variety of other products and services to meet the needs of policyholders. The industry is highly competitive, with a large number of companies offering a variety of products. Life insurance companies must be licensed in every state in which they do business, and are subject to regulation by the state insurance commissioner. The life insurance industry has undergone a number of changes in recent years, including the introduction of new products, the consolidation of companies, and the emergence of new distribution channels.According to statistics from McKinsey, life insurance made up 45% of global premiums in 2019, up 4.4% from its share in 2018. Global life insurance gross premiums went up by 4% in 2019, in line with the growth rate in 2017 and 2018. Developing economies in the Asia Pacific region exhibited the fastest growth in the world, and grew by 10% in 2019. The pandemic drove the life insurance premiums growth in 2020 and 2021, however, growth attributed to the pandemic appears to be slowing down according to the 2023 insurance outlook by Deloitte. Deloitte analysts expect a minor contraction in global premiums growth in 2022, 0.2%, partly due to rising interest rates and surging inflation. However, Deloitte forecasts that global premiums growth will rebound in 2023 and record a 1.9% increase in the year across emerging markets as the inflation situation cools down and economic conditions improve. Deloitte expects life insurance premiums to fall across North America, Europe, and China in 2022. However, the firm sees emerging markets, excluding China, registering a positive growth print of 3.5% for premiums in 2022, led by India recording a 6% increase in life insurance premiums for the year.

Companies that have done so for 25 consecutive years are crowned Dividend Aristocrats, and there are 65 such companies on the S&amp;P 500.  Then there are the Dividend Kings, which have raised their annual payouts for at least 50 consecutive years.While those companies usually rank among the safest dividend stocks to own and are likely to continue growing their dividends at a modest pace in the years to come, many of them have relatively modest dividend growth rates in the single digits.To find some of the fastest growing dividend stocks of large cap companies often requires looking outside those vaunted lists. These are large companies that in many cases are growing their earnings faster than some of the long-time stalwarts on those lists, which in turn allows them to grow their dividends at a faster rate than those dividend greybeards.These stocks offer the potential for both share appreciation and strong double digit dividend growth over the long-term, which makes them a compelling mix of income and growth stock, and some of the most coveted top dividend stocks on the market.The following list of best dividend growth stocks have all grown their dividends at a CAGR of at least 10% over the past five years, meaning their dividend payments are more than 50% higher than what they were just five years ago.

United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 38 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 11.3% JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) are some of the best large cap dividend stocks with fast growing dividend payments. Another is United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), which has grown its dividend at a CAGR of 11.3% over the last five years. Much of that growth came this year, when UPS jacked its quarterly dividend payments by nearly 50% to $1.52. UPS has a 12-year run of dividend growth going, in addition to a 21-year run of dividend payments.UPS shares currently yield a solid 3.64% and the company’s dividend payments eat up just 43% of the company’s net income at present, so there’s plenty of room for continued growth. While slowing global growth could weigh on package volumes in the near term, UPS has been adept at cutting costs and paying down its debt, resulting in a more efficient company with a stronger balance sheet that will be able to weather any kind of recessionary storm.Hedge fund ownership of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) sank during Q2, as there was a 24% drop in the number of smart money managers long the stock. That continued a longer trend, with the decline in ownership reaching 34% dating back to the third quarter of 2020. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, managed by Michael Larson, owned 740,689 shares of UPS as of June 30.Mayer Capital likes United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)’s growing profit and the company’s plans to distribute that profit to shareholders, as revealed in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“UPS has been a beneficiary of the pandemic-related shift to e-commerce. Revenues increased 15% in the year, with strong leverage in the business boosting operating profit by al- most 67%. Management is focusing on a ‘Better not Bigger’ strategy for the business and divested the UPS Freight business early in the year. Mean- while, the company is expected to increase distributions to shareholders in 2022, from both dividends and share buybacks.”14. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 61 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 10.7% Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) switched to quarterly dividend payments in the final quarter of 2019 and has since raised those payouts by 40% to $1.12. The tech consulting company has a 16-year streak of making dividend payments and a three-year run of dividend growth. Its payout ratio stands at just 37%, while ACN shares yield 1.56%.Not only did Accenture pay out $2.5 billion in dividends during its fiscal 2022, it also repurchased $4.1 billion worth of shares, so the company is richly rewarding shareholders with its growing earnings (up 22% year-over-year to $10.71 during FY22).Hedge fund ownership of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) jumped by 23% during Q1 to hit an all-time high and remained flat during Q2. Hedge funds have been steadily buying into the company in greater numbers, as evidenced by the five straight quarters of ownership growth the stock experienced between Q2 2020 and Q3 2021. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners opened a new stake in ACN during Q2, buying 1.35 million shares.Aristotle Capital Management, which owns 628,965 shares of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) as of June 30, believes the company is well positioned to capitalize on the growing trend towards digital transformation, as detailed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) provides management and technology consulting services and solutions. The company delivers a range of specialized capabilities and solutions to clients across all industries and around the world. Accenture offers a portfolio of management consulting, strategy, digital, technology, interactive and business operations services to some of the leading companies and government organizations.We see digital transformation strategies remain a key initiative for global enterprises and believe Accenture is well-positioned. The company’s IT service and solutions business has an attractive mix to capitalize on digital transformation strategies. We have a positive view on Accenture’s historical success in Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A), which supports the company’s growth through talent acquisition as well as niche technology bolt-ons.”13. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 61 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12.1% Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is in the midst of a nine-year run of dividend growth, highlighted by a 25% raise to its quarterly dividend in 2021. The company’s dividend history is complicated by its split with AbbVie however, which necessitated a lower subsequent payout. The company is otherwise considered a Dividend King, with a 50-year streak of dividend growth.The medical device manufacturer pays out just 33% of its net income in dividends, and its shares carry a 1.89% yield. While Abbott’s adjusted diluted EPS fell by 17.9% to $1.15 during Q3, analysts believe the company can grow that figure by 11% over the next five years, which could sustain continued double digit growth in the company’s dividend.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has consistently remained among the second tier of most popular stocks among hedge funds, routinely hovering around the top 50. Several big money managers have large stakes in the company, including Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management and Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates.Another fund with a big stake in the company is Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital which discussed its bullish stance on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG).Abbott has been working through a recall of its infant formula brand Similac in the US, which has continued to pressure its share price. Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”12. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 69 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12.2% Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has an eight-year run of dividend growth ongoing, which included a 33% hike to its quarterly payments in the second quarter of 2021. The company’s payout ratio is a miniscule 26%, so there’s no shortage of future dividend growth opportunities. ORCL shares currently yield 1.65%. Oracle has a growing cloud business that is proving to be a cash cow for the company, which is expected to pull in $5.01 per share in earnings during its current fiscal year ended May 2023.There has been a rise in hedge fund ownership of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) for six straight quarters, with a 31% increase during that time. Gavin Baker’s Atreides Management opened a position in ORCL during Q2, while Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management did so during Q1.First Eagle Investments, which owns the largest stake in Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) as of June 30 among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey, discussed the company’s strong operations in the First Eagle Investments Global Fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Oracle is one of the world’s largest independent enterprise software companies and has been reinventing itself for the cloud-computing environment, a transition pursued primarily through investments in organic research and design and smallish, well-priced acquisitions. That said, Oracle in June closed its largest-ever deal with the acquisition of Cerner, a designer of software to store and analyze medical records and other healthcare data.Oracle took on additional debt to finance this all-cash acquisition and as a result plans to moderate its stock-buyback program to focus on debt reduction. Despite the weak quarter for the stock, Oracle’s operations remain strong; it reported better- than-expected results for its most recent quarter and issued upbeat guidance for the coming fiscal year.”11. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 70 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12.9% Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) shares have one of the lowest yields among this group of growth stocks at just 1.09%, but there’s nonetheless a lot to like about the future of the pharmaceutical giant’s dividend payments, which have been experiencing accelerating growth over the past few years. LLY grew its dividend by 14.7% in 2020, followed by a 14.8% hike in 2021, and a 15.3% increase this year. The company’s payout ratio is 44%.Eli Lilly boasts a promising pipeline of more than 20 candidates that could fuel future earnings growth and dividend increases. The company’s diabetes medicine Mounjaro alone could be a game changer, with analysts projecting as much as $25 billion in annual sales for the treatment at its peak.Hedge fund ownership of Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) jumped by 32% during Q2 to hit an all-time high. There are now twice as many smart money managers long the stock as there were five years earlier. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owns 5.93 million LLY shares as of June 30, while Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP opened a new stake in the company during Q2.Baron Funds is bullish on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)’s diabetes drug Mounjaro, as it discussed in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment is in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is off to a strong start. In addition, Mounjaro may be approved for obesity next year. In clinical trials, Mounjaro delivered up to 22.5% average weight loss in adults with obesity and has the potential to be a top-selling drug. Lilly also has a drug in development for Alzheimer’s disease in the same class as Lecanemab, a drug being developed by Biogen and Eisai that slowed the rate of cognitive decline in a late-stage clinical trial. Lilly is not facing any significant near-term patent expirations and we think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”10. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 71 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 17.3% AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) has a nine-year run of dividend growth going since its split from Abbott Labs and its dividend has been picking up steam at a rapid pace. The company grew its quarterly payments by 50% between Q4 2017 and Q4 2018, and the dividend has risen by more than 50% on top of that since. The next payment of $1.41 is scheduled for November 15 to shareholders of record as of October 14, and the company’s first payment of 2023 will rise again, to $1.48. ABBV shares yield just over 4%.While AbbVie is set to lose the exclusivity on its blockbuster drug Humira next year, the company already has two growing successors on its heels in the form of Rinvoq and Skyrizi, which grew revenue by 56% and 85% respectively during Q2. AbbVie also has a deep and promising pipeline in facial aesthetics treatments, a market that’s expected to grow at a CAGR of 14% through 2028.The number of funds long AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) has ticked down for the past two quarters, falling by 14% during that period. David Harding’s Winton Capital Management and Anna Nikolayevsky’s Axel Capital Management sold off their ABBV stakes during Q2. Arrowstreet Capital, lead by the team of Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell, held the largest Abbvie stake on June 30 among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database.Baron Funds also discussed AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter, in which it expressed optimism about the company’s drug pipeline:“AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a drug developer best known for Humira, an immunosuppressant that is the best selling drug of all time. Given outsized key product risk (patent cliff and generic launches beginning in 2023), AbbVie has broadened its pipeline, highlighted by its Allergan acquisition. Shares fell on results that missed consensus and indications that legacy franchises were outperforming newer product launches, calling into question AbbVie’s long-term strategy. With promising assets in the pipeline and its robust cash flow profile, we believe AbbVie will grow well into the future.”9. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 72 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 11.1% NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has a 32-year streak of paying dividends and a nine-year run of dividend growth. Since the company’s stock split in 2016, its quarterly dividend payments have grown from $0.16 to $0.305. NKE shares yield a modest 1.3%, but with the company’s growing margins thanks to its digital initiatives and 34% payout ratio, it’s likely that will continue to push higher in the future. In the near term, Nike’s margins are being pressured by a glut of inventory, but sales rose by 10% in the company’s fiscal Q1 when adjusting for currency, which outpaced Nike’s sales growth from FY22.Hedge funds were buying into NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) during Q2 as the stock continued its descent, as there was a 9% uptick in smart money ownership of the company. Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owns the largest NKE stake as of June 30, holding 8.54 million shares. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP sold off 24% of its large Nike position during Q1 and owns 6.73 million shares as of June 30.The RiverPark Large Growth Fund suffered from NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares’ underperformance during Q3, being one of the fund’s top detractors, as outlined in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Nike: NKE shares were a top detractor this quarter on higher inventory balances leading to lower-than-expected gross margins for the next couple of quarters. The company reported 1Q23 sales and EPS beats, but freight costs, markdowns, and the strong dollar weighed on gross margins. Nike continues to expect low double-digit currency-neutral sales growth, but the strong dollar will reduce overall sales growth and discounted inventory will further reduce gross margins for the year.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. After working through its near-term currency and gross margin issues, we expect the company to return towards management’s guidance of at least 10% annual revenue growth, and return to its accelerating profit growth, as longer-term we expect margins to be materially aided by rising average sales prices (from both increased pricing and a mix shift to more premium products), the company’s deep innovation pipeline, a secular shift from the company’s traditional wholesale channels to a more direct-to-consumer approach (now 35% of revenues up from 16% ten years ago), and a more streamlined supply chain. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect the combined gross and operating margin improvements from its initiatives will drive long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”8. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 80 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 17% The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has one of the highest dividend growth rates on this list over the last five years, having more than doubled its dividend payments during that time. The company has a 12-year run of dividend growth and a 45% payout ratio that makes future raises appear to not be an issue. HD shares currently yield 2.54%. Home Depot has a strong balance sheet and should be able to weather any weakness in the housing market, as evidenced by its performance during the financial crisis, when it was still generating a profit during the housing market’s darkest days.Hedge fund ownership of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has jumped for the three straight quarters, increasing by 34% during that time, even as funds have been selling out of the company’s rival Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) in droves. Richard Chilton’s Chilton Investment Company owns one of the most bullish stakes in HD among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database, holding 753,813 shares as of June 30, giving the fund 5.76% 13F exposure to the stock.Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital, which owns 1.26 million The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) shares as of June 30, believes the company is poised to take market share in the professional customer segment, as revealed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a high-quality operator in the home improvement industry. Macroeconomic concerns, particularly the rise in mortgage rates, caused the share price to pull back and trade at a greater discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Home Depot is well positioned to continue gaining share due to its premium real estate locations, strong operations and recent investments in its supply chain. We like Home Depot’s exposure to the professional customer and believe in its ability to take market share in this segment as we believe home improvement spending has the potential to remain resilient in upcoming years.”7. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 82 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12% Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) has raised its quarterly dividend payments by 79% since 2017 and the company’s payout ratio still stands at a miniscule 9%, so similar growth over the next five years is certainly a possibility. DHR shares do sport a tiny yield of 0.40%, but expect that to rise in the years to come.The life sciences company’s sales are slowing rapidly as Covid testing numbers decline, with 2023 revenue growth expected to be just 0.5%. However, longer-term the company has several strong segments that are growing at double-digit rates which will eventually become more visible once Covid testing numbers stabilize or decline enough to no longer offset those gains.Hedge fund ownership of Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) hit an all-time at the end of 2021, with the stock ranking among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds for the first time. The number of funds long DHR has since dipped by 9%. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management and Dan Loeb’s Third Point are among the company’s biggest smart money backers.The Cooper Investors Global Equities Fund is bullish on Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)’s spinoff of its Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions group, as detailed in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Spin-offs have been a valuable source of uncorrelated return for the portfolio since inception, whether investing in them directly or retaining ownership stakes in the spun-off assets of existing holdings. During the quarter Danaher announced the spin of its Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions group (EAS) expected to close in late 2023. Danaher have been masters of the spin over the last decade and once again this one appears to make sense for both parties. The parent becomes a pure-play life sciences and diagnostics business with higher growth, margins and returns plus more M&amp;A firepower. EAS, with leading positions in water quality through assets like Hach, ChemTreat and Trojan will, as a standalone business, have a more focused M&amp;A strategy and represent an attractive water-related exposure for ESG focused funds. The spinco will still operate with the highly regarded Danaher Business System though (like ‘Fortive Business System’) we expect this to get rebranded while still delivering outstanding financial results.”6. UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 91 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 17.7% Closing out the first part of our list is UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), which has been growing its dividend at an impressive rate for several years, pushing its yield up to 1.2%. Its quarterly dividend payments have more than doubled since 2017, including growing by 13.8% earlier this year to $1.65. The managed care insurer grew adjusted diluted EPS by 28.1% year-over-year in Q3 to $5.79, and has significant secular tailwinds that should allow it to continue growing earnings and expanding its margins. With a payout ratio of just 29%, UNH is well positioned to pay out heftier dividends in the years to come.UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) hit triple digits in hedge fund ownership for the first time in Q4 2018 and reached an all-time high of 110 in Q2 of 2021. Ownership of the stock has dipped by 17% in the four quarters since then. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners owns the largest UNH stake among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database, holding 3.11 million shares on June 30. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management owns 2.87 million shares.Carillon Tower Advisers noted that the defensive aspects of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)’s managed care business helped the company perform well relative to the market in Q2, as discussed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported solid quarterly results and raised 2022 guidance modestly. Additionally, managed care is another industry that is viewed as defensive in the current environment, which helped support UnitedHealth and its peer group.”Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to the 5 Best Real Estate Stocks to Buy Now.Real estate stocks are known for insulating an investment portfolio against rising inflation. Inflation grew by 8.2% YoY during September 2022 in the US, surpassing a four-decade high recorded earlier in the year. Although the US Federal Reserve has increased benchmark interest rates five times in 2022, the increase in inflation is showing minimal signs of slowing down and coming close to the Fed’s target of 2%. During such times, the best real estate stocks offer safe long-term investment opportunities to shareholders with attractive dividend yields. Furthermore, these real estate companies lease out the properties owned by them and enjoy the benefit of a regular increase in rent. The rent increase is usually indexed against the consumer price index (CPI), which aids these companies in growing their income in line with the inflation levels.A majority of the best real estate stocks are structured as real estate investment trusts (REITs). REITs are entities that generate 75% of their income from the assets under their ownership which can be either real estate, cash, or US treasuries. Furthermore, they are required to give back at least 90% of their taxable income as dividends to shareholders. According to Nareit, all types of REITs in the US collectively own $4.5 trillion worth of gross assets, and publicly listed REITs own two-thirds of these assets. The market capitalization of all the publicly listed REITs in the US stands at $1.4 trillion as of Q3 2022, with 30 entities included in the S&amp;P 500 Index.

Read this and more market news on the go with Yahoo Finance App.I realize that market watchers have become even more obsessed with imminent Fed decisions and what officials say in various interviews (such as on Yahoo Finance), but there is more going on in business and finance than the central bank.And if we're learning anything this earnings season, it's that it's surprisingly a good time to be a stockpicker as the market clearly defines winning companies versus losing companies.To that end, here are a few stories that have recently caught my attention.Look at GameStop go: Remember when $GME was over $347 a share at the height of the meme stock craze in late January 2021 (note: the stock split 4-1 in July 2022)? Yeah, well, it's a $28 stock today as the company has continued to operationally struggle and Ryan Cohen enjoys sending bizarre tweets out of his Florida compound.Readers of the Morning Brief know where I stand on $GME, but that is neither here nor there — $GME stock has quietly risen 11% in the past month. S3 Partners CEO Bob Sloan, the Wall Street veteran who just in the new Netflix doc on the meme stock craze, made a good point on $GME on Yahoo Finance Live: ""If you look at $GME, I think there's still a billion two short in the stock. If this stock goes past $30, you could see something parabolic.""Bob's comments went viral on Reddit and saw heavy interest on the Yahoo Finance Twitter feed — perhaps teasing another push higher in the stock for whatever the reasons. After all, it's almost the holiday season (video game sales pick up) and the company still has its hardcore fanbase.Story continuesMcDonald's is back in a big way: The Golden Arches put up a third quarter that checked a lot of boxes for Wall Street bulls: 1) Tasty U.S. same-store sales increase of 6% on higher traffic; 2) U.S. same-store sales above consensus increase of 4%; 3) Solid earnings call by management. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports that consumers aren't even balking at higher prices for Big Macs and fries.Clearly, the company has tapped into something with the return of Halloween Happy Meal pails, adult Happy Meal toys, and the beloved McRib. That momentum could carry McDonald's into year end, argues long-time restaurant analyst David Palmer at Evercore ISI: ""While declining consumer sentiment in the U.S. and Europe is a concern, McDonald’s has shown its historical resiliency in recessions. We believe McDonalds is firing on full cylinders including 1) more impactful marketing and promotions (e.g. Adult Happy Meals and McRib Farewell Tour), 2) strong digital and loyalty engagement; and 3) renovated store assets and premium food options.""Workers repair the logo on a McDonald's sign in Manila, Philippines, on October 6, 2015. Picture taken October 6, 2015. REUTERS/Erik De CastroEconomic slowdown hasn't hurt Bud Light sales: I spent some time talking with AB-InBev CEO Michel Doukeris following a third quarter report that I think surprised a lot of folks positively. Total sales were up 12.1% and total volumes gained 3.7%.

(NYSE:PLD) stock gained 9.6% last week, insiders who sold US$8.0m worth of stock over the past year are probably better off. Selling at an average price of US$164, which is higher than the current price, may have been the wisest decision for these insiders as their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Prologis The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PrologisOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Lead Independent Director, Irving Lyons, for US$7.3m worth of shares, at about US$165 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$113. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In total, Prologis insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Prologis insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$137m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Prologis Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Prologis, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. When we did our research, we found 3 warning signs for Prologis (1 can't be ignored!) that we believe deserve your full attention.Of course Prologis may not be the best stock to buy.

The service is meant to act as an alternative to centralized storage providers like Amazon Web Services.The Decentralized Storage Alliance, launched in conjunction with the nonprofit Filecoin Foundation, will work to establish development standards that would help decentralized storage solutions meet the needs of enterprise customers, including making it easier for data centers to onboard onto a decentralized network. Working groups will be created to solve other specific issues that could slow the transition from Web2 to Web3.“As the global data and storage markets are accelerating, there is a lag in the adoption of decentralized storage technologies,” James Canterbury, partner and principal at EY Blockchain, said in the press release.The founding partners aren’t new to the crypto space. AMD’s central and graphics processing units (CPU and GPU) have long been used by crypto miners. Seagate experienced a sales surge last year due to Chia, a blockchain that utilizes the unused computer storage space of miners to validate the network. EY announced a partnership with the Polygon protocol in Sept. 2021 to deploy its own products on the Ethereum blockchain. The first of those products – a supply chain manager – launched earlier this year.“We see decentralized storage as an opportunity to diversify and add resilience to our data infrastructure,” Canterbury continued. “And we see the alliance as a crucial piece of this – enabling adoption of decentralized storage and cohesion across the broader industry.""Read more: What Are IPFS and Filecoin and How Can They Be Used for NFTs?]"

Companies that have done so for 25 consecutive years are crowned Dividend Aristocrats, and there are 65 such companies on the S&amp;P 500.  Then there are the Dividend Kings, which have raised their annual payouts for at least 50 consecutive years.While those companies usually rank among the safest dividend stocks to own and are likely to continue growing their dividends at a modest pace in the years to come, many of them have relatively modest dividend growth rates in the single digits.To find some of the fastest growing dividend stocks of large cap companies often requires looking outside those vaunted lists. These are large companies that in many cases are growing their earnings faster than some of the long-time stalwarts on those lists, which in turn allows them to grow their dividends at a faster rate than those dividend greybeards.These stocks offer the potential for both share appreciation and strong double digit dividend growth over the long-term, which makes them a compelling mix of income and growth stock, and some of the most coveted top dividend stocks on the market.The following list of best dividend growth stocks have all grown their dividends at a CAGR of at least 10% over the past five years, meaning their dividend payments are more than 50% higher than what they were just five years ago.

United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 38 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 11.3% JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) are some of the best large cap dividend stocks with fast growing dividend payments. Another is United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), which has grown its dividend at a CAGR of 11.3% over the last five years. Much of that growth came this year, when UPS jacked its quarterly dividend payments by nearly 50% to $1.52. UPS has a 12-year run of dividend growth going, in addition to a 21-year run of dividend payments.UPS shares currently yield a solid 3.64% and the company’s dividend payments eat up just 43% of the company’s net income at present, so there’s plenty of room for continued growth. While slowing global growth could weigh on package volumes in the near term, UPS has been adept at cutting costs and paying down its debt, resulting in a more efficient company with a stronger balance sheet that will be able to weather any kind of recessionary storm.Hedge fund ownership of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) sank during Q2, as there was a 24% drop in the number of smart money managers long the stock. That continued a longer trend, with the decline in ownership reaching 34% dating back to the third quarter of 2020. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, managed by Michael Larson, owned 740,689 shares of UPS as of June 30.Mayer Capital likes United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)’s growing profit and the company’s plans to distribute that profit to shareholders, as revealed in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“UPS has been a beneficiary of the pandemic-related shift to e-commerce. Revenues increased 15% in the year, with strong leverage in the business boosting operating profit by al- most 67%. Management is focusing on a ‘Better not Bigger’ strategy for the business and divested the UPS Freight business early in the year. Mean- while, the company is expected to increase distributions to shareholders in 2022, from both dividends and share buybacks.”14. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 61 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 10.7% Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) switched to quarterly dividend payments in the final quarter of 2019 and has since raised those payouts by 40% to $1.12. The tech consulting company has a 16-year streak of making dividend payments and a three-year run of dividend growth. Its payout ratio stands at just 37%, while ACN shares yield 1.56%.Not only did Accenture pay out $2.5 billion in dividends during its fiscal 2022, it also repurchased $4.1 billion worth of shares, so the company is richly rewarding shareholders with its growing earnings (up 22% year-over-year to $10.71 during FY22).Hedge fund ownership of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) jumped by 23% during Q1 to hit an all-time high and remained flat during Q2. Hedge funds have been steadily buying into the company in greater numbers, as evidenced by the five straight quarters of ownership growth the stock experienced between Q2 2020 and Q3 2021. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners opened a new stake in ACN during Q2, buying 1.35 million shares.Aristotle Capital Management, which owns 628,965 shares of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) as of June 30, believes the company is well positioned to capitalize on the growing trend towards digital transformation, as detailed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) provides management and technology consulting services and solutions. The company delivers a range of specialized capabilities and solutions to clients across all industries and around the world. Accenture offers a portfolio of management consulting, strategy, digital, technology, interactive and business operations services to some of the leading companies and government organizations.We see digital transformation strategies remain a key initiative for global enterprises and believe Accenture is well-positioned. The company’s IT service and solutions business has an attractive mix to capitalize on digital transformation strategies. We have a positive view on Accenture’s historical success in Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A), which supports the company’s growth through talent acquisition as well as niche technology bolt-ons.”13. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 61 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12.1% Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is in the midst of a nine-year run of dividend growth, highlighted by a 25% raise to its quarterly dividend in 2021. The company’s dividend history is complicated by its split with AbbVie however, which necessitated a lower subsequent payout. The company is otherwise considered a Dividend King, with a 50-year streak of dividend growth.The medical device manufacturer pays out just 33% of its net income in dividends, and its shares carry a 1.89% yield. While Abbott’s adjusted diluted EPS fell by 17.9% to $1.15 during Q3, analysts believe the company can grow that figure by 11% over the next five years, which could sustain continued double digit growth in the company’s dividend.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has consistently remained among the second tier of most popular stocks among hedge funds, routinely hovering around the top 50. Several big money managers have large stakes in the company, including Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management and Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates.Another fund with a big stake in the company is Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital which discussed its bullish stance on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG).Abbott has been working through a recall of its infant formula brand Similac in the US, which has continued to pressure its share price. Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”12. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 69 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12.2% Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has an eight-year run of dividend growth ongoing, which included a 33% hike to its quarterly payments in the second quarter of 2021. The company’s payout ratio is a miniscule 26%, so there’s no shortage of future dividend growth opportunities. ORCL shares currently yield 1.65%. Oracle has a growing cloud business that is proving to be a cash cow for the company, which is expected to pull in $5.01 per share in earnings during its current fiscal year ended May 2023.There has been a rise in hedge fund ownership of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) for six straight quarters, with a 31% increase during that time. Gavin Baker’s Atreides Management opened a position in ORCL during Q2, while Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management did so during Q1.First Eagle Investments, which owns the largest stake in Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) as of June 30 among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey, discussed the company’s strong operations in the First Eagle Investments Global Fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Oracle is one of the world’s largest independent enterprise software companies and has been reinventing itself for the cloud-computing environment, a transition pursued primarily through investments in organic research and design and smallish, well-priced acquisitions. That said, Oracle in June closed its largest-ever deal with the acquisition of Cerner, a designer of software to store and analyze medical records and other healthcare data.Oracle took on additional debt to finance this all-cash acquisition and as a result plans to moderate its stock-buyback program to focus on debt reduction. Despite the weak quarter for the stock, Oracle’s operations remain strong; it reported better- than-expected results for its most recent quarter and issued upbeat guidance for the coming fiscal year.”11. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 70 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12.9% Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) shares have one of the lowest yields among this group of growth stocks at just 1.09%, but there’s nonetheless a lot to like about the future of the pharmaceutical giant’s dividend payments, which have been experiencing accelerating growth over the past few years. LLY grew its dividend by 14.7% in 2020, followed by a 14.8% hike in 2021, and a 15.3% increase this year. The company’s payout ratio is 44%.Eli Lilly boasts a promising pipeline of more than 20 candidates that could fuel future earnings growth and dividend increases. The company’s diabetes medicine Mounjaro alone could be a game changer, with analysts projecting as much as $25 billion in annual sales for the treatment at its peak.Hedge fund ownership of Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) jumped by 32% during Q2 to hit an all-time high. There are now twice as many smart money managers long the stock as there were five years earlier. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owns 5.93 million LLY shares as of June 30, while Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP opened a new stake in the company during Q2.Baron Funds is bullish on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)’s diabetes drug Mounjaro, as it discussed in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment is in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is off to a strong start. In addition, Mounjaro may be approved for obesity next year. In clinical trials, Mounjaro delivered up to 22.5% average weight loss in adults with obesity and has the potential to be a top-selling drug. Lilly also has a drug in development for Alzheimer’s disease in the same class as Lecanemab, a drug being developed by Biogen and Eisai that slowed the rate of cognitive decline in a late-stage clinical trial. Lilly is not facing any significant near-term patent expirations and we think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”10. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 71 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 17.3% AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) has a nine-year run of dividend growth going since its split from Abbott Labs and its dividend has been picking up steam at a rapid pace. The company grew its quarterly payments by 50% between Q4 2017 and Q4 2018, and the dividend has risen by more than 50% on top of that since. The next payment of $1.41 is scheduled for November 15 to shareholders of record as of October 14, and the company’s first payment of 2023 will rise again, to $1.48. ABBV shares yield just over 4%.While AbbVie is set to lose the exclusivity on its blockbuster drug Humira next year, the company already has two growing successors on its heels in the form of Rinvoq and Skyrizi, which grew revenue by 56% and 85% respectively during Q2. AbbVie also has a deep and promising pipeline in facial aesthetics treatments, a market that’s expected to grow at a CAGR of 14% through 2028.The number of funds long AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) has ticked down for the past two quarters, falling by 14% during that period. David Harding’s Winton Capital Management and Anna Nikolayevsky’s Axel Capital Management sold off their ABBV stakes during Q2. Arrowstreet Capital, lead by the team of Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell, held the largest Abbvie stake on June 30 among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database.Baron Funds also discussed AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter, in which it expressed optimism about the company’s drug pipeline:“AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a drug developer best known for Humira, an immunosuppressant that is the best selling drug of all time. Given outsized key product risk (patent cliff and generic launches beginning in 2023), AbbVie has broadened its pipeline, highlighted by its Allergan acquisition. Shares fell on results that missed consensus and indications that legacy franchises were outperforming newer product launches, calling into question AbbVie’s long-term strategy. With promising assets in the pipeline and its robust cash flow profile, we believe AbbVie will grow well into the future.”9. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 72 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 11.1% NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has a 32-year streak of paying dividends and a nine-year run of dividend growth. Since the company’s stock split in 2016, its quarterly dividend payments have grown from $0.16 to $0.305. NKE shares yield a modest 1.3%, but with the company’s growing margins thanks to its digital initiatives and 34% payout ratio, it’s likely that will continue to push higher in the future. In the near term, Nike’s margins are being pressured by a glut of inventory, but sales rose by 10% in the company’s fiscal Q1 when adjusting for currency, which outpaced Nike’s sales growth from FY22.Hedge funds were buying into NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) during Q2 as the stock continued its descent, as there was a 9% uptick in smart money ownership of the company. Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owns the largest NKE stake as of June 30, holding 8.54 million shares. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP sold off 24% of its large Nike position during Q1 and owns 6.73 million shares as of June 30.The RiverPark Large Growth Fund suffered from NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares’ underperformance during Q3, being one of the fund’s top detractors, as outlined in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Nike: NKE shares were a top detractor this quarter on higher inventory balances leading to lower-than-expected gross margins for the next couple of quarters. The company reported 1Q23 sales and EPS beats, but freight costs, markdowns, and the strong dollar weighed on gross margins. Nike continues to expect low double-digit currency-neutral sales growth, but the strong dollar will reduce overall sales growth and discounted inventory will further reduce gross margins for the year.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. After working through its near-term currency and gross margin issues, we expect the company to return towards management’s guidance of at least 10% annual revenue growth, and return to its accelerating profit growth, as longer-term we expect margins to be materially aided by rising average sales prices (from both increased pricing and a mix shift to more premium products), the company’s deep innovation pipeline, a secular shift from the company’s traditional wholesale channels to a more direct-to-consumer approach (now 35% of revenues up from 16% ten years ago), and a more streamlined supply chain. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect the combined gross and operating margin improvements from its initiatives will drive long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”8. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 80 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 17% The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has one of the highest dividend growth rates on this list over the last five years, having more than doubled its dividend payments during that time. The company has a 12-year run of dividend growth and a 45% payout ratio that makes future raises appear to not be an issue. HD shares currently yield 2.54%. Home Depot has a strong balance sheet and should be able to weather any weakness in the housing market, as evidenced by its performance during the financial crisis, when it was still generating a profit during the housing market’s darkest days.Hedge fund ownership of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has jumped for the three straight quarters, increasing by 34% during that time, even as funds have been selling out of the company’s rival Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) in droves. Richard Chilton’s Chilton Investment Company owns one of the most bullish stakes in HD among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database, holding 753,813 shares as of June 30, giving the fund 5.76% 13F exposure to the stock.Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital, which owns 1.26 million The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) shares as of June 30, believes the company is poised to take market share in the professional customer segment, as revealed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a high-quality operator in the home improvement industry. Macroeconomic concerns, particularly the rise in mortgage rates, caused the share price to pull back and trade at a greater discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Home Depot is well positioned to continue gaining share due to its premium real estate locations, strong operations and recent investments in its supply chain. We like Home Depot’s exposure to the professional customer and believe in its ability to take market share in this segment as we believe home improvement spending has the potential to remain resilient in upcoming years.”7. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 82 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12% Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) has raised its quarterly dividend payments by 79% since 2017 and the company’s payout ratio still stands at a miniscule 9%, so similar growth over the next five years is certainly a possibility. DHR shares do sport a tiny yield of 0.40%, but expect that to rise in the years to come.The life sciences company’s sales are slowing rapidly as Covid testing numbers decline, with 2023 revenue growth expected to be just 0.5%. However, longer-term the company has several strong segments that are growing at double-digit rates which will eventually become more visible once Covid testing numbers stabilize or decline enough to no longer offset those gains.Hedge fund ownership of Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) hit an all-time at the end of 2021, with the stock ranking among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds for the first time. The number of funds long DHR has since dipped by 9%. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management and Dan Loeb’s Third Point are among the company’s biggest smart money backers.The Cooper Investors Global Equities Fund is bullish on Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)’s spinoff of its Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions group, as detailed in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Spin-offs have been a valuable source of uncorrelated return for the portfolio since inception, whether investing in them directly or retaining ownership stakes in the spun-off assets of existing holdings. During the quarter Danaher announced the spin of its Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions group (EAS) expected to close in late 2023. Danaher have been masters of the spin over the last decade and once again this one appears to make sense for both parties. The parent becomes a pure-play life sciences and diagnostics business with higher growth, margins and returns plus more M&amp;A firepower. EAS, with leading positions in water quality through assets like Hach, ChemTreat and Trojan will, as a standalone business, have a more focused M&amp;A strategy and represent an attractive water-related exposure for ESG focused funds. The spinco will still operate with the highly regarded Danaher Business System though (like ‘Fortive Business System’) we expect this to get rebranded while still delivering outstanding financial results.”6. UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 91 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 17.7% Closing out the first part of our list is UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), which has been growing its dividend at an impressive rate for several years, pushing its yield up to 1.2%. Its quarterly dividend payments have more than doubled since 2017, including growing by 13.8% earlier this year to $1.65. The managed care insurer grew adjusted diluted EPS by 28.1% year-over-year in Q3 to $5.79, and has significant secular tailwinds that should allow it to continue growing earnings and expanding its margins. With a payout ratio of just 29%, UNH is well positioned to pay out heftier dividends in the years to come.UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) hit triple digits in hedge fund ownership for the first time in Q4 2018 and reached an all-time high of 110 in Q2 of 2021.

169,1c3b8a17-78e1-373a-83bc-de69911fe225,UPS,2022-10-31,United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) shareholders have earned a 11% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-parcel-nyse-ups-shareholders-110015903.html,1667214015,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 14% in the last quarter. But the silver lining is the stock is up over five years. In that time, it is up 45%, which isn't bad, but is below the market return of 60%. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 22% drop, in the last year.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, United Parcel Service managed to grow its earnings per share at 26% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 8% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that United Parcel Service has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling United Parcel Service stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of United Parcel Service, it has a TSR of 68% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveThe total return of 19% received by United Parcel Service shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -21%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. If the stock price has been impacted by changing sentiment, rather than deteriorating business conditions, it could spell opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.00bUS$4.57bUS$4.99bUS$5.45bUS$5.80bUS$6.09bUS$6.35bUS$6.57bUS$6.77bUS$6.95bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x5Est @ 6.36%Est @ 5.05%Est @ 4.13%Est @ 3.48%Est @ 3.03%Est @ 2.72% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.9% US$3.8kUS$4.1kUS$4.2kUS$4.3kUS$4.4kUS$4.3kUS$4.2kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$41bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 5.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (5.9%– 2.0%) = US$180bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$180b÷ ( 1 + 5.9%)10= US$101bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$143b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$314, the company appears quite good value at a 44% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Vertex Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.842. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 largest defense contractors in the world in 2022.The world seems to be heading towards a recession, despite being able to seemingly get over a global pandemic due to the early development of a vaccine which saved millions of lives. Inflation has reached recorded highs, and while you may think that most countries would be focused on their own economies and trying to ease the lives of the people living in them, geopolitical upheaval has made a mockery of this belief. In February 2022, Russia initiated an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which eight months later, is still no closer to an end with heavy losses to both sides, though the latter has definitely suffered the worst of it, with thousands of civilians dying and major infrastructure being destroyed by Russia. The West, to counter growing Russian threat, has united against it despite some disagreements, and supplied weapons and aid to Ukraine to be able to defend its territory. Regardless of who emerges victorious, the current geopolitical scenario bodes quite well for the defense contractor industry.The defense industry is one of the few industries to have emerged largely unscathed from the pandemic and has continued to maintain modest growth in the US, while delivering significant growth in Europe, according to a report by PwC. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, global military spending set a new record of $2.1 trillion in 2021, and remember, this was before a major war which has led to significantly higher military spending in 2022 by most of the Western countries. While the industry wasn't majorly affected by the pandemic, it did face some issues especially due to worker absenteeism and supply chain shortages, after the global supply chain faced considerable challenges.Before the Russian invasion, most military spending was to counter terrorism, especially in the United States and Europe. For other countries such as India and Pakistan, military spending is to ensure preparedness amidst rising tensions between the two countries, especially after India's Air Force transgressed Pakistani territory and was shot down by the Pakistan Army. Meanwhile, China has also continued to spend massively on its military, to establish its might even as relations with the West continue to deteriorate and skirmished with India, its neighbor, have taken place as well. China, along with the United States, dominates the list of the biggest defense contractors in the world.Story continuesLargest Defense Contractors in the World in 2022Photo by Somchai Kongkamsri from PexelsAfter Russia's invasion, priorities of Western nations have changed significantly, reverting more to Cold War style priorities; as an example, both Finland and Sweden have applied for NATO membership after the invasion despite threats by Russia. Meanwhile, the United States, realizing the importance of countering Russian aggression, has pledged at least $16.9 billion to Ukraine since January 2021, of which $16.2 billion have been provided after the invasion in February. The European Union member countries have also not held back, providing important weapons and aid to Ukraine, which is a major reason why it has been able to resist Russia's invasion to this extent so far, and this increase in defense spending is beneficial to the biggest defense contractors in the world in 2022.According to the Business Research Company, the global defense market grew from $475 billion in 2021 to $514 billion in 2022, at a CAGR of 8.2%, aided by the Russia Ukraine war, and is expected to increase at a CAGR of 3.2% to $581 billion by 2026. To determine the biggest defense contractors in the world in 2022, we referred the Fortune 500 global list and the Fortune 500 list. We then ranked each defense company based on its revenues, profits, assets and number of employees, with 40% weightage being assigned to the first two criteria and 20% weightage being assigned to the last two. So, let's take a look at the companies most likely to benefit from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, starting with number 15:15. Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

(NYSE:HII) was launched in 2011 as a spin-off of another company in our list, Northrop Grumman.14. Textron Inc.

""Beer as a category is very resilient.""AB-InBev produces everything from good old affordable Bud Light to more premium priced non-beers such as CutWater.Doukeris says not only haven't beer sales waned this year, consumers don't appear to be trading down to cheaper alternatives.""Not yet — globally, we don't see this,"" Doukeris said when asked about consumers trading down overall. ""Premiumization as a trend continues to grow and is doing well. You think about our global brands, more premium brands, this quarter they grew very well, led by Corona, that grew revenues 23.5%, while we grew revenues 12%, a little bit above that in the quarter. So more premium beers continue to move. It's almost unstoppable trend I think in the category. A lot of headroom to continue to premiumize.""A fan carries a four tray full of Budweiser beer during the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia group F match between Germany and Sweden at Fisht Stadium on June 23, 2018 in Sochi, Russia. (Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images)To Doukeris' point, AB-InBev saw sales of the often higher priced Corona rise 23.5% in the third quarter — a faster clip than the company's total revenue increase of 12.1%. And the company's Beyond Beer segment, comprised mostly of various hard seltzers and beer alternatives, rose 10% from a year ago.AB-InBev also managed to surpass most analyst estimates for the third quarter on the back of demand for higher priced offerings.Here is how AB-Inbev performed compared to Wall Street forecasts:Total Sales: $15.09 billion vs. $15.15 billionOrganic Revenue Growth: +12.1% vs. +10.8%Adjusted EBITDA: $5.31 billion vs. $5.32 billionAdjusted EPS: $0.81 vs. $0.77AB-InBev stock is up 1% in the past month.""Strong beat and raise emblematic of commercial momentum,"" Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein, who has an Outperform rating on AB-InBev shares with a $70 price target, wrote in a client note after the the company's results. ""Further, guidance raise suggests high visibility on costs and continued strong demand in most markets with limited if any trade down and a new round of pricing coming in the U.S. and Europe. Valuation is compelling.""Story continuesOttenstein added that sales and margins ""should improve as mobility improves and revenge partying continues through World Cup / year-end.""Doukeris echoed the optimism on the potential sales impact of the World Cup set to kick off in Qatar in late November.""Numbers from FIFA say that like 2.5, 3 billion people watch the games globally,"" Doukeris said.

178,76f4b3dd-e4bc-32ed-bf72-0140714bb027,KO,2022-10-31,A Deep Dive Into MSFT’s and KO’s Earnings,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deep-dive-msft-ko-earnings-203212401.html,1666902732,STORY,"['MSFT', '^GSPC', 'KO']","[As I’m sure you’re well aware now… we’re delving deeper into my favorite time of year: earnings season.And this week is a busy one, with 165 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting this week alone.Remember, earnings season is where we find out which companies are growing… and which are not. A good report can boost shares higher, while a bad one can send shares falling…InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWe’re seeing this trend play out this week. Yesterday, Alphabet, Inc.’s (GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation’s (MSFT) post-earnings declines dragged stocks down on the heels of their lackluster reports, knocking the tech-heavy NASDAQ down 2%.In today’s Market 360, we’re going to take a look at two big earnings reports this week: Microsoft and The Coca-Cola Company (KO).Then tomorrow, we’ll review the much-anticipated FAANG earnings, with the last of these stocks set to report today after the closing bell.Let’s jump right in.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)Microsoft reported its first-quarter results in fiscal year 2022 on Tuesday afternoon.The company did beat on the top and bottom lines: Earnings of $2.35 per share and revenue of $50.12 billion beat analysts’ expectations for earnings of $2.30 per share and revenue of $49.61 billion.However, Microsoft missed on revenue forecasts for its cloud divisions and lowered forward-looking guidance.Regarding the cloud divisions…Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud business segment, which includes the Azure and other cloud services, generated $20.33 billion in quarterly revenue, up 20% year-over-year but less than the $20.36 billion estimated.Microsoft expects $52.35 billion to $53.35 billion in revenue for the fiscal second quarter, which would be 2% growth. This missed analyst expectations for $56.05 billion.On the earnings conference call, CEO Satya Nadella said that cyclical trends are affecting Microsoft’s consumer business. CFO Amy Hood noted weak demand for PCs in September will continue to hit the company’s consumer segment.Story continuesBottom line: The decline in PC sales and the dollar’s strength – as MSFT is a multinational company that is adversely affected by a strong U.S. dollar – continued to weigh on its profits and growth.Microsoft shares declined 6.7% in after-hours trading Tuesday and have trended lower since the company’s disappointing results.Taking a look at Portfolio Grader, Microsoft was recently downgraded to a C-rating, or a “Hold.”While my Portfolio Grader isn’t telling investors to run for the hills just yet, it did anticipate caution, as it downgraded MSFT to a hold two weeks ago.Shares of the tech giant have fallen roughly 25% this year, compared to the S&amp;P 500’s 19% drop. As I shared yesterday in a Special Market Podcast to my Growth Investor readers, the fact is we are seeing a shift away from tech. As such, I would remain focused on companies with growing earnings that are not subject to the affects of the strong dollar.The Coca-Cola Company (KO)The Coca-Cola Company (KO) also reported on Tuesday. Coco-Cola reported third-quarter earnings for its fiscal year 2022.The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.69, compared to estimates for earnings per share of $0.64. KO also announced that revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $11.05 billion, beating analysts’ expectations for revenue of $10.52 billion.Coco-Cola noted that it has had to hike prices to keep up with rising commodity costs and shipping expenses. Expenses are expected to continue to climb in 2023 due to inflation. The company’s executives indicated that more price hikes might be in store in the next 12 months. As a multinational company, the company warned that the strong dollar and foreign currency may way on earnings and revenue next year.That said, KO’s earnings were certainly a bright spot. Shares closed up 2.3% on Tuesday.In fact, year-to-date, the company’s shares continue to outperform the S&amp;P 500…The company currently sports a B-rating in Portfolio Grader and has been in buy territory for the last 10 months.Investors who acted could have road shares higher… beating the broad market.The fact is that earnings are working. You just need to position yourself with the companies that will beat in times of inflation and a strong dollar like we’re experiencing now.This Quarter’s Market LeadersMy Growth Investor stocks are breaking out as market leaders amidst this quarter’s earnings season.My average Growth Investor stock is characterized by 64.2% annual sales growth and 473.9% annual earnings growth, yet trade at just only 7.2 times median forecasted 2023 earnings.Furthermore, my average Growth Investor stock is cash rich and boosted their dividend 152% in the past year. In the previous quarter, the average earnings surprise was 31.5%, so I am anticipating another spectacular earnings announcement season for my Growth Investor stocks!You see, the Growth Investor Buy List stocks largely represent an anti-ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) portfolio. CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin and Jim Cramer helped to push ESG stocks, which capitulated last year after Wall Street did a “pump and dump” for the Rivian Automotive, Inc. (RIVN) and Lucid Group, Inc. (LCID) IPOs that were briefly worth more than Ford Motor Company (F) and General Motors Company (GM), respectively.Unfortunately, the prices of lithium, nickel and cobalt soared, so electric vehicles (EVs) are now luxury items due to soaring battery costs. It’s questionable if Rivian and Lucid can even find enough batteries to reach profitability. Even Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), with booming EV sales, has been punished for having lowered fourth-quarter sales expectations due somewhat to battery supply complications.Wall Street’s anti-fossil fuel and ESG push drove energy stocks down to less than 2% of the S&amp;P 500 a year ago.Today, energy stocks are the best performing sector and now represent approximately 6% of the S&amp;P 500. Within two years, I expect energy stocks will be 30% of the S&amp;P 500 and appreciate 100% per year for the next couple years!My Growth Investor Buy List stocks are well positioned to continue to profit from the energy and commodity inflation that has enveloped the world. The Federal Reserve is increasing key interest rates to try to squelch inflation, but energy and food inflation continues to rise from ESG policies that are inherently inflationary due to the attacks on fossil fuels and chemical fertilizers.In this month’s Growth Investor issue, which I will release tomorrow evening, I’ll be sharing an exciting energy stock with a high dividend yield that also sports an AA-rating (meaning it has an A-rating in Portfolio Grader and Dividend Grader), so it offers a solid blend of income and growth. I will also reveal my Top Stocks to act on that are also great bets for new money right now.To access the issue the moment it’s released, simply click here.

179,01c197c2-01da-3fd7-bb85-895bb84be078,WM,2022-10-31,"A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-waste-management-110044933.html,1667214044,STORY,['WM'],"[Does the October share price for Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Waste Management The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.99bUS$2.67bUS$2.90bUS$3.13bUS$3.31bUS$3.45bUS$3.58bUS$3.70bUS$3.80bUS$3.90bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x9Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 5.58%Est @ 4.5%Est @ 3.74%Est @ 3.21%Est @ 2.84%Est @ 2.58% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$1.9kUS$2.3kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$23bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.0%) = US$87bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$87b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$46bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$68b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$158, the company appears about fair value at a 5.2% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Waste Management as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.981. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Companies that have done so for 25 consecutive years are crowned Dividend Aristocrats, and there are 65 such companies on the S&amp;P 500.  Then there are the Dividend Kings, which have raised their annual payouts for at least 50 consecutive years.While those companies usually rank among the safest dividend stocks to own and are likely to continue growing their dividends at a modest pace in the years to come, many of them have relatively modest dividend growth rates in the single digits.To find some of the fastest growing dividend stocks of large cap companies often requires looking outside those vaunted lists.

United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 38 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 11.3% JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) are some of the best large cap dividend stocks with fast growing dividend payments. Another is United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), which has grown its dividend at a CAGR of 11.3% over the last five years. Much of that growth came this year, when UPS jacked its quarterly dividend payments by nearly 50% to $1.52. UPS has a 12-year run of dividend growth going, in addition to a 21-year run of dividend payments.UPS shares currently yield a solid 3.64% and the company’s dividend payments eat up just 43% of the company’s net income at present, so there’s plenty of room for continued growth. While slowing global growth could weigh on package volumes in the near term, UPS has been adept at cutting costs and paying down its debt, resulting in a more efficient company with a stronger balance sheet that will be able to weather any kind of recessionary storm.Hedge fund ownership of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) sank during Q2, as there was a 24% drop in the number of smart money managers long the stock. That continued a longer trend, with the decline in ownership reaching 34% dating back to the third quarter of 2020. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, managed by Michael Larson, owned 740,689 shares of UPS as of June 30.Mayer Capital likes United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)’s growing profit and the company’s plans to distribute that profit to shareholders, as revealed in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“UPS has been a beneficiary of the pandemic-related shift to e-commerce. Revenues increased 15% in the year, with strong leverage in the business boosting operating profit by al- most 67%. Management is focusing on a ‘Better not Bigger’ strategy for the business and divested the UPS Freight business early in the year. Mean- while, the company is expected to increase distributions to shareholders in 2022, from both dividends and share buybacks.”14. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 61 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 10.7% Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) switched to quarterly dividend payments in the final quarter of 2019 and has since raised those payouts by 40% to $1.12. The tech consulting company has a 16-year streak of making dividend payments and a three-year run of dividend growth. Its payout ratio stands at just 37%, while ACN shares yield 1.56%.Not only did Accenture pay out $2.5 billion in dividends during its fiscal 2022, it also repurchased $4.1 billion worth of shares, so the company is richly rewarding shareholders with its growing earnings (up 22% year-over-year to $10.71 during FY22).Hedge fund ownership of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) jumped by 23% during Q1 to hit an all-time high and remained flat during Q2. Hedge funds have been steadily buying into the company in greater numbers, as evidenced by the five straight quarters of ownership growth the stock experienced between Q2 2020 and Q3 2021. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners opened a new stake in ACN during Q2, buying 1.35 million shares.Aristotle Capital Management, which owns 628,965 shares of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) as of June 30, believes the company is well positioned to capitalize on the growing trend towards digital transformation, as detailed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) provides management and technology consulting services and solutions. The company delivers a range of specialized capabilities and solutions to clients across all industries and around the world. Accenture offers a portfolio of management consulting, strategy, digital, technology, interactive and business operations services to some of the leading companies and government organizations.We see digital transformation strategies remain a key initiative for global enterprises and believe Accenture is well-positioned. The company’s IT service and solutions business has an attractive mix to capitalize on digital transformation strategies. We have a positive view on Accenture’s historical success in Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A), which supports the company’s growth through talent acquisition as well as niche technology bolt-ons.”13. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 61 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12.1% Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is in the midst of a nine-year run of dividend growth, highlighted by a 25% raise to its quarterly dividend in 2021. The company’s dividend history is complicated by its split with AbbVie however, which necessitated a lower subsequent payout. The company is otherwise considered a Dividend King, with a 50-year streak of dividend growth.The medical device manufacturer pays out just 33% of its net income in dividends, and its shares carry a 1.89% yield. While Abbott’s adjusted diluted EPS fell by 17.9% to $1.15 during Q3, analysts believe the company can grow that figure by 11% over the next five years, which could sustain continued double digit growth in the company’s dividend.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has consistently remained among the second tier of most popular stocks among hedge funds, routinely hovering around the top 50. Several big money managers have large stakes in the company, including Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management and Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates.Another fund with a big stake in the company is Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital which discussed its bullish stance on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also among our bottom contributors were health care products manufacturer Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), global pharmaceutical company Pfizer, media and technology giant Alphabet, and insurance company American International Group (AIG).Abbott has been working through a recall of its infant formula brand Similac in the US, which has continued to pressure its share price. Although the recall will impact near-term revenues, we are not concerned about any long-term impacts. We remain optimistic about the company given it is one of the highest quality names in health care, in our view, with a talented management team that makes smart capital allocation decisions. Abbott also has leading health care and consumer franchises with a particularly strong competitive position in its medical device business. The company continues to launch innovative products in key strategic areas (such as diabetes, structural heart, and diagnostics), which should help drive not only revenue growth but margin expansion.”12. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 69 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12.2% Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has an eight-year run of dividend growth ongoing, which included a 33% hike to its quarterly payments in the second quarter of 2021. The company’s payout ratio is a miniscule 26%, so there’s no shortage of future dividend growth opportunities. ORCL shares currently yield 1.65%. Oracle has a growing cloud business that is proving to be a cash cow for the company, which is expected to pull in $5.01 per share in earnings during its current fiscal year ended May 2023.There has been a rise in hedge fund ownership of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) for six straight quarters, with a 31% increase during that time. Gavin Baker’s Atreides Management opened a position in ORCL during Q2, while Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management did so during Q1.First Eagle Investments, which owns the largest stake in Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) as of June 30 among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey, discussed the company’s strong operations in the First Eagle Investments Global Fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Oracle is one of the world’s largest independent enterprise software companies and has been reinventing itself for the cloud-computing environment, a transition pursued primarily through investments in organic research and design and smallish, well-priced acquisitions. That said, Oracle in June closed its largest-ever deal with the acquisition of Cerner, a designer of software to store and analyze medical records and other healthcare data.Oracle took on additional debt to finance this all-cash acquisition and as a result plans to moderate its stock-buyback program to focus on debt reduction. Despite the weak quarter for the stock, Oracle’s operations remain strong; it reported better- than-expected results for its most recent quarter and issued upbeat guidance for the coming fiscal year.”11. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 70 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12.9% Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) shares have one of the lowest yields among this group of growth stocks at just 1.09%, but there’s nonetheless a lot to like about the future of the pharmaceutical giant’s dividend payments, which have been experiencing accelerating growth over the past few years. LLY grew its dividend by 14.7% in 2020, followed by a 14.8% hike in 2021, and a 15.3% increase this year. The company’s payout ratio is 44%.Eli Lilly boasts a promising pipeline of more than 20 candidates that could fuel future earnings growth and dividend increases. The company’s diabetes medicine Mounjaro alone could be a game changer, with analysts projecting as much as $25 billion in annual sales for the treatment at its peak.Hedge fund ownership of Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) jumped by 32% during Q2 to hit an all-time high. There are now twice as many smart money managers long the stock as there were five years earlier. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owns 5.93 million LLY shares as of June 30, while Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP opened a new stake in the company during Q2.Baron Funds is bullish on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)’s diabetes drug Mounjaro, as it discussed in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“In pharmaceuticals, our largest investment is in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). Lilly’s new diabetes drug Mounjaro is off to a strong start. In addition, Mounjaro may be approved for obesity next year. In clinical trials, Mounjaro delivered up to 22.5% average weight loss in adults with obesity and has the potential to be a top-selling drug. Lilly also has a drug in development for Alzheimer’s disease in the same class as Lecanemab, a drug being developed by Biogen and Eisai that slowed the rate of cognitive decline in a late-stage clinical trial. Lilly is not facing any significant near-term patent expirations and we think the company should be able to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.”10. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 71 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 17.3% AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) has a nine-year run of dividend growth going since its split from Abbott Labs and its dividend has been picking up steam at a rapid pace. The company grew its quarterly payments by 50% between Q4 2017 and Q4 2018, and the dividend has risen by more than 50% on top of that since. The next payment of $1.41 is scheduled for November 15 to shareholders of record as of October 14, and the company’s first payment of 2023 will rise again, to $1.48. ABBV shares yield just over 4%.While AbbVie is set to lose the exclusivity on its blockbuster drug Humira next year, the company already has two growing successors on its heels in the form of Rinvoq and Skyrizi, which grew revenue by 56% and 85% respectively during Q2. AbbVie also has a deep and promising pipeline in facial aesthetics treatments, a market that’s expected to grow at a CAGR of 14% through 2028.The number of funds long AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) has ticked down for the past two quarters, falling by 14% during that period. David Harding’s Winton Capital Management and Anna Nikolayevsky’s Axel Capital Management sold off their ABBV stakes during Q2. Arrowstreet Capital, lead by the team of Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell, held the largest Abbvie stake on June 30 among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database.Baron Funds also discussed AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in its Q3 2022 investor letter, in which it expressed optimism about the company’s drug pipeline:“AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a drug developer best known for Humira, an immunosuppressant that is the best selling drug of all time. Given outsized key product risk (patent cliff and generic launches beginning in 2023), AbbVie has broadened its pipeline, highlighted by its Allergan acquisition. Shares fell on results that missed consensus and indications that legacy franchises were outperforming newer product launches, calling into question AbbVie’s long-term strategy. With promising assets in the pipeline and its robust cash flow profile, we believe AbbVie will grow well into the future.”9. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 72 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 11.1% NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has a 32-year streak of paying dividends and a nine-year run of dividend growth. Since the company’s stock split in 2016, its quarterly dividend payments have grown from $0.16 to $0.305. NKE shares yield a modest 1.3%, but with the company’s growing margins thanks to its digital initiatives and 34% payout ratio, it’s likely that will continue to push higher in the future. In the near term, Nike’s margins are being pressured by a glut of inventory, but sales rose by 10% in the company’s fiscal Q1 when adjusting for currency, which outpaced Nike’s sales growth from FY22.Hedge funds were buying into NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) during Q2 as the stock continued its descent, as there was a 9% uptick in smart money ownership of the company. Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owns the largest NKE stake as of June 30, holding 8.54 million shares. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP sold off 24% of its large Nike position during Q1 and owns 6.73 million shares as of June 30.The RiverPark Large Growth Fund suffered from NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) shares’ underperformance during Q3, being one of the fund’s top detractors, as outlined in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Nike: NKE shares were a top detractor this quarter on higher inventory balances leading to lower-than-expected gross margins for the next couple of quarters. The company reported 1Q23 sales and EPS beats, but freight costs, markdowns, and the strong dollar weighed on gross margins. Nike continues to expect low double-digit currency-neutral sales growth, but the strong dollar will reduce overall sales growth and discounted inventory will further reduce gross margins for the year.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $46 billion in revenue, $6 billion in 2021 annual free cash flow, and over $4 billion of excess cash. After working through its near-term currency and gross margin issues, we expect the company to return towards management’s guidance of at least 10% annual revenue growth, and return to its accelerating profit growth, as longer-term we expect margins to be materially aided by rising average sales prices (from both increased pricing and a mix shift to more premium products), the company’s deep innovation pipeline, a secular shift from the company’s traditional wholesale channels to a more direct-to-consumer approach (now 35% of revenues up from 16% ten years ago), and a more streamlined supply chain. We believe that the continued global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect the combined gross and operating margin improvements from its initiatives will drive long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future.”8. The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 80 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 17% The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has one of the highest dividend growth rates on this list over the last five years, having more than doubled its dividend payments during that time. The company has a 12-year run of dividend growth and a 45% payout ratio that makes future raises appear to not be an issue. HD shares currently yield 2.54%. Home Depot has a strong balance sheet and should be able to weather any weakness in the housing market, as evidenced by its performance during the financial crisis, when it was still generating a profit during the housing market’s darkest days.Hedge fund ownership of The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has jumped for the three straight quarters, increasing by 34% during that time, even as funds have been selling out of the company’s rival Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) in droves. Richard Chilton’s Chilton Investment Company owns one of the most bullish stakes in HD among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database, holding 753,813 shares as of June 30, giving the fund 5.76% 13F exposure to the stock.Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital, which owns 1.26 million The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) shares as of June 30, believes the company is poised to take market share in the professional customer segment, as revealed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a high-quality operator in the home improvement industry. Macroeconomic concerns, particularly the rise in mortgage rates, caused the share price to pull back and trade at a greater discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Home Depot is well positioned to continue gaining share due to its premium real estate locations, strong operations and recent investments in its supply chain. We like Home Depot’s exposure to the professional customer and believe in its ability to take market share in this segment as we believe home improvement spending has the potential to remain resilient in upcoming years.”7. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 82 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 12% Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) has raised its quarterly dividend payments by 79% since 2017 and the company’s payout ratio still stands at a miniscule 9%, so similar growth over the next five years is certainly a possibility. DHR shares do sport a tiny yield of 0.40%, but expect that to rise in the years to come.The life sciences company’s sales are slowing rapidly as Covid testing numbers decline, with 2023 revenue growth expected to be just 0.5%. However, longer-term the company has several strong segments that are growing at double-digit rates which will eventually become more visible once Covid testing numbers stabilize or decline enough to no longer offset those gains.Hedge fund ownership of Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) hit an all-time at the end of 2021, with the stock ranking among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds for the first time. The number of funds long DHR has since dipped by 9%. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management and Dan Loeb’s Third Point are among the company’s biggest smart money backers.The Cooper Investors Global Equities Fund is bullish on Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)’s spinoff of its Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions group, as detailed in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Spin-offs have been a valuable source of uncorrelated return for the portfolio since inception, whether investing in them directly or retaining ownership stakes in the spun-off assets of existing holdings. During the quarter Danaher announced the spin of its Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions group (EAS) expected to close in late 2023. Danaher have been masters of the spin over the last decade and once again this one appears to make sense for both parties. The parent becomes a pure-play life sciences and diagnostics business with higher growth, margins and returns plus more M&amp;A firepower. EAS, with leading positions in water quality through assets like Hach, ChemTreat and Trojan will, as a standalone business, have a more focused M&amp;A strategy and represent an attractive water-related exposure for ESG focused funds. The spinco will still operate with the highly regarded Danaher Business System though (like ‘Fortive Business System’) we expect this to get rebranded while still delivering outstanding financial results.”6. UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 91 5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 17.7% Closing out the first part of our list is UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), which has been growing its dividend at an impressive rate for several years, pushing its yield up to 1.2%. Its quarterly dividend payments have more than doubled since 2017, including growing by 13.8% earlier this year to $1.65. The managed care insurer grew adjusted diluted EPS by 28.1% year-over-year in Q3 to $5.79, and has significant secular tailwinds that should allow it to continue growing earnings and expanding its margins. With a payout ratio of just 29%, UNH is well positioned to pay out heftier dividends in the years to come.UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) hit triple digits in hedge fund ownership for the first time in Q4 2018 and reached an all-time high of 110 in Q2 of 2021. Ownership of the stock has dipped by 17% in the four quarters since then. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners owns the largest UNH stake among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database, holding 3.11 million shares on June 30. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management owns 2.87 million shares.Carillon Tower Advisers noted that the defensive aspects of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)’s managed care business helped the company perform well relative to the market in Q2, as discussed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported solid quarterly results and raised 2022 guidance modestly. Additionally, managed care is another industry that is viewed as defensive in the current environment, which helped support UnitedHealth and its peer group.”Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADP). The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months.

186,b2e406a7-2686-3d90-98bc-7c34b878330c,PG,2022-10-31,Selling US$34m worth of The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) stock at high prices would have gotten insiders a handsome reward,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/selling-us-34m-worth-procter-120135996.html,1667217695,STORY,['PG'],"[Last week, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company's (NYSE:PG) stock jumped 5.2%, but insiders who sold US$34m worth of stock in over the past year are likely to be in a better position. Selling at an average price of US$150, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best move for these insiders because their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Procter &amp; GambleThe President, Jon Moeller, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$4.5m worth of shares at a price of US$149 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$135. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Procter &amp; Gamble insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Procter &amp; Gamble Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Procter &amp; Gamble. In total, insiders sold US$26m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider Ownership Of Procter &amp; GambleFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Procter &amp; Gamble insiders own 0.07% of the company, worth about US$223m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Procter &amp; Gamble Insiders?Insiders sold Procter &amp; Gamble shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Procter &amp; Gamble makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

193,702cb629-e8b7-3cb8-b1d1-82c17b1dd2c8,GPS,2022-10-31,Exclusive-Gap says Russia deliveries stopped in March. But its clothing kept coming,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-gap-says-russia-deliveries-100239501.html,1667210559,STORY,['GPS'],"[By Siddharth Cavale, Steve Stecklow and David Gauthier-VillarsNEW YORK/LONDON/ISTANBUL (Reuters) -In March, clothing retailer Gap Inc joined numerous Western companies in announcing that it was halting deliveries to Russia to protest its invasion of Ukraine.“As a values-led company, one that is proud to do the right thing over the past 53 years in business, at this time, we have also suspended deliveries to Russia, where we have a small franchise presence,” the San Francisco-based company announced in a March 10 message to its employees.But Russian customs records reviewed by Reuters show that between March 11 and July 16, Gap's franchisee in Moscow received 1,585 clothing shipments with a declared value of $5.2 million. More than three-quarters of the deliveries list the supplier as Gap Europe Ltd, a London-based unit of Gap Inc.The Russian customs records are drawn from several commercial providers of trade data and go through Sept. 30. They provide details of Russian imports from customs forms, including suppliers, importers, product descriptions and declared values.The Gap shipments included everything from ""knitted children’s socks"" and ""children’s pajamas"" to ""textile blouses for women"" and ""textile shorts for men.""Clothing, except for luxury items, generally doesn’t fall under the recent Western sanctions on Russia so as not to punish ordinary citizens. But the post-March 10 shipments appear to contradict Gap’s claim to its employees.A Gap Inc spokesperson in San Francisco told Reuters in an email on Oct. 19 that “we stopped shipments to Russia as we announced in March and have not resumed.”Reuters later provided Gap with Russian customs data showing the 1,585 shipments after March 10 to Gap Retail LLC, a Gap franchisee in Moscow. It is operated by Fiba Perakende Grubu, an Istanbul-based retailer that runs all the Gap stores in Russia, Turkey and Ukraine.On Oct. 28, Gap acknowledged to Reuters that it had continued facilitating deliveries of clothes to Russia until April – a month after it told employees it had suspended all deliveries.Story continues“Because orders are made many months in advance, our franchise partner collected its final order from our distribution center in April. Gap neither shipped nor sold any merchandise to our Russian franchise partner since their final order was processed,” the Gap spokesman said in response to questions posed by Reuters.Gap didn’t respond to questions about exactly when the orders were placed, when they were fulfilled or why it didn’t cancel outstanding orders after its March 10 announcement.Asked why the clothing shipments to Russia continued until July, a Fiba Perakende manager said in a statement, “These shipments were delayed due to longer transit times via Turkey, as well as additional handling time at Russian customs.”But according to the Russian customs records reviewed by Reuters, the vast majority of the clothing shipments make no mention of Turkey as a transit point. Fiba didn’t respond to a question about the discrepancy. ‘SOME ITEMS ARE MISSING’The Fiba Perakende statement added that “due to Gap Inc’s decision to indefinitely suspend delivery of Gap products to Russia, Fiba is in the process of winding down its Gap franchise business in Russia, upon depletion of any remaining on-hand stock in Russia.”Along with its e-commerce website, gap.ru, Fiba Perakende said in its statement it had operated 23 stores in three major Russian cities.Gap Europe disclosed $9.6 million in annual franchise sales for Russia in its last fiscal year, ending Jan. 30, 2021, down from $11.5 million the prior year, according to its annual report and financial statements. Gap Europe’s business has been struggling, and it closed dozens of its company-operated stores last year in the United Kingdom and Ireland. A Gap Europe director didn’t respond to a request for comment about the Russian shipments.A woman who answered the telephone this week at a Gap store in central Moscow said it remained open. Asked about its clothing selection, she replied, “Yes, we have some choice. Of course, it depends what you are looking for. Some items are missing.”Russian customs records show more than 1,200 shipments of Gap clothing to Russia between March 11 – the day after Gap Inc’s announcement that it was halting shipments – and June 21. In every case, the supplier was listed as Gap Europe with the Netherlands as the departure country and Russia as the destination – with no mention of Turkey as a transit point. In its most recent annual report, Gap Europe said it was changing its distribution center for its franchise business from the United Kingdom to the Netherlands.Other shipments to Russia in June and July list the supplier as either “Ankara customs” or another Istanbul company that is linked to Fiba Perakende – suggesting the clothing may have passed through Turkey.After July 16, the customs records show no shipments to Gap Retail in Moscow, indicating that the apparel flow to Russia had stopped.Gap's March statement that it had suspended deliveries to Russia also said it would donate $1 million worth of clothing to Ukrainian refugees. In its latest statement to Reuters, Gap said, “We stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.”(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in New York, Steve Stecklow in London and David Gauthier-Villars in Istanbul; Editing by Vanessa O'Connell and Chris Sanders)]"
