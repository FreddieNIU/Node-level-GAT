You should consider the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 10/20/2011.The fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $40.69 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. When you look at long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets. But in strong bull markets, growth stocks are more likely to be winners.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.06%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.36%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 20.80% of the portfolio.

The Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index is designed to measure the performance of high dividend yielding stocks issued by U.S. companies that have a record of consistently paying dividends, selected for fundamental strength relative to their peers, based on financial ratios.The ETF has lost about -6.41% so far this year and is down about -3.09% in the last one year (as of 11/10/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $66.43 and $81.94.The ETF has a beta of 0.90 and standard deviation of 23.56% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space.

6,356c4cad-aef4-315c-96d4-05627fb214e9,WDC,2022-11-10,Increases to CEO Compensation Might Be Put On Hold For Now at Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/increases-ceo-compensation-might-put-101820594.html,1668075500,STORY,['WDC'],"[The underwhelming share price performance of Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) in the past three years would have disappointed many shareholders. However, what is unusual is that EPS growth has been positive, suggesting that the share price has diverged from fundamentals. Shareholders may want to question the board on the future direction of the company at the upcoming AGM on 16 November 2022. They could also influence management through voting on resolutions such as executive remuneration. We think shareholders might be reluctant to increase compensation for the CEO at the moment, according to our analysis below. See our latest analysis for Western Digital Comparing Western Digital Corporation's CEO Compensation With The IndustryAccording to our data, Western Digital Corporation has a market capitalization of US$11b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth US$32m over the year to July 2022. That's a notable increase of 88% on last year. We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at US$1.3m.In comparison with other companies in the industry with market capitalizations over US$8.0b, the reported median total CEO compensation was US$19m. Accordingly, our analysis reveals that Western Digital Corporation pays David Goeckeler north of the industry median. Moreover, David Goeckeler also holds US$5.4m worth of Western Digital stock directly under their own name, which reveals to us that they have a significant personal stake in the company.Component20222021Proportion (2022)SalaryUS$1.3mUS$1.3m4%OtherUS$31mUS$16m96%Total CompensationUS$32mUS$17m100%On an industry level, roughly 16% of total compensation represents salary and 84% is other remuneration. Western Digital has chosen to walk a path less trodden, opting to compensate its CEO with less of a traditional salary and more non-salary rewards over the last year. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance.Story continuesceo-compensationA Look at Western Digital Corporation's Growth NumbersOver the past three years, Western Digital Corporation has seen its earnings per share (EPS) grow by 110% per year. In the last year, its revenue is down 3.1%.This demonstrates that the company has been improving recently and is good news for the shareholders. While it would be good to see revenue growth, profits matter more in the end. Moving away from current form for a second, it could be important to check this free visual depiction of what analysts expect for the future.Has Western Digital Corporation Been A Good Investment?The return of -31% over three years would not have pleased Western Digital Corporation shareholders. This suggests it would be unwise for the company to pay the CEO too generously.To Conclude...Western Digital primarily uses non-salary benefits to reward its CEO. Despite the growth in its earnings, the share price decline in the past three years is certainly concerning. The stock's movement is disjointed with the company's earnings growth, which ideally should move in the same direction. Shareholders would be keen to know what's holding the stock back when earnings have grown. These concerns should be addressed at the upcoming AGM, where shareholders can question the board and evaluate if their judgement and decision making is still in line with their expectations.CEO compensation is an important area to keep your eyes on, but we've also need to pay attention to other attributes of the company. That's why we did our research, and identified 2 warning signs for Western Digital (of which 1 can't be ignored!) that you should know about in order to have a holistic understanding of the stock.Arguably, business quality is much more important than CEO compensation levels.

8,b3fda3a9-1669-387b-a4ce-55353c485618,NUE,2022-11-10,Those who invested in Nucor (NYSE:NUE) five years ago are up 179%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-nucor-nyse-nue-193435276.html,1668022475,STORY,['NUE'],"[The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For instance, the price of Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) stock is up an impressive 145% over the last five years. And in the last month, the share price has gained 17%. This could be related to the recent financial results that were recently released - you could check the most recent data by reading our company report.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Nucor There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Nucor managed to grow its earnings per share at 58% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 20% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 4.03.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Nucor has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? Take a more thorough look at Nucor's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Nucor, it has a TSR of 179% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Nucor has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 21% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 23% per year, is even more impressive. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Nucor better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Nucor (1 can't be ignored)  that you should be aware of.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Acuity Brands (AYI) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to AYI for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Acuity Brands' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Acuity Brands' main business drivers.Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, Acuity Brands, Inc. is the parent company of Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. (“ABL”) and other subsidiaries. The company manufactures and distributes lighting fixtures and related components that comprise devices such as luminaries, lighting controls, and controllers for various building systems, power supplies, prismatic skylights, and drivers, as well as integrated systems designed to optimize energy efficiency and comfort for various indoor and outdoor applications.The company intended to separate the lighting, lighting controls and components business and intelligent buildings business. In sync with this, during the third quarter of fiscal 2021, the company completed the realignment of its business operations and structured into two units: Acuity Brands Lighting and Lighting Controls or ABL (accounting for 94.9% of fiscal 2021 net sales) and Intelligent Spaces Group or ISG (5.1%).Additionally, it has expanded its solutions portfolio, including software and services, that benefits economy in data analytics that enables the Internet of Things (“IoT”); supports the advancement of smart buildings, cities, and grid; and allows businesses to develop custom applications to scale their operations.The portfolio of lighting solutions comprises lighting products utilizing fluorescent, light emitting diode (LED), organic LED (OLED), high intensity discharge, metal halide, and incandescent light sources to illuminate a number of applications.Acuity Brands provides lighting solutions for commercial, institutional, industrial, infrastructure, and residential applications throughout North America and as well as Europe and Asia. The company has one reportable segment serving the North American and select international markets.The company has a wide variety of brands that include Lithonia Lighting, Holophane, Peerless, Gotham, Mark Architectural Lighting, Winona Lighting, Juno, Indy, Aculux, Healthcare Lighting, Hydrel, American Electric Lighting, Antique Street Lamps, Sunoptics, eldoLED, Distech Controls, nLight, ROAM, Sensor Switch, Power Sentry, IOTA, and Atrius.Story continuesBottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Acuity Brands, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in November 2012 would be worth $3,015.70, or a gain of 201.57%, as of November 9, 2022, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 177.90% and gold's return of -4.99% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for AYI.Acuity Brands’ shares have outperformed the industry in the past year. The trend is likely to continue, backed by strong fourth-quarter and fiscal 2022 results. The top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased on a year-over-year basis. Higher sales from both the segments, along with price increases and product and productivity improvements, drove the results. Also, a diversified portfolio of innovative lighting control solutions and energy-efficient luminaries adds to the positives. However, gross and adjusted operating margins contracted 50 basis points (bps) each in the fiscal fourth quarter due to higher material, labor and freight costs. For fiscal 2023, net sales are expected to be within $4.1-$4.3 billion. Adjusted earnings are likely to be in the range of $13-$14.50 per share.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 13.16%, and there have been 4 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

You can skip our introductory talk on Charlie Munger and read Charlie Munger Stock Portfolio: 2 Biggest Positions.Charlie Munger, the 98-year-old billionaire investor and a partner of Warren Buffett, bought the Daily Journal in late 1970s through the New America Fund. Because of his background, Munger transformed the Daily Journal into a law publication. Munger graduated magna cum laude with a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1948. At Harvard, he was a member of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau. The company now sells software to court systems and justice agencies, and publishes newspapers.Earlier this year, Munger gave up the chairman title at the Daily Journal Corp. and donated $1 million of stock to create an equity-incentive plan for the company.Charlie Munger has invited the wrath of retail investors on platforms like Reddit because of his harsh comments against cryptocurrencies. Earlier this year, Munger reportedly said during an annual meeting of the Daily Journal that cryptocurrencies should be banned.“I certainly didn’t invest in crypto. I’m proud of the fact I’ve avoided it. It’s like a venereal disease or something. I just regard it as beneath contempt.”Munger also praised China for dealing with crypto with an iron hand.Munger also once called Bitcoin “rat poison.”“Certainly the great short squeeze in GameStop was wretched excess, certainly the Bitcoin thing is wretched excess. I would argue that venture capital is throwing too much money too fast, and there’s a considerable wretched excess in venture capital and other forms of private equity,” said Munger during the annual meeting.""Munger’s publication made a lot of money during the housing crisis of 2008 as it used to publish foreclosure notices related to the housing markets of California and Arizona. However, after the economy recovered, Munger’s publication started investing in stocks. The SEC was quick to object that the publication did not qualify to invest in stocks as it was not an investment company. However, as reported by the FT, the Daily Journal’s counsel responded:Story continues“The board recognized that this decision would be contrary to the conventional (but questionable) notion that the least risky way to preserve corporate capital for the long-term benefit of stockholders is to invest it in government bonds at interest rates approximating zero, notwithstanding rising inflation.”Overall, the Daily Journal’s strategy of investing in stocks has been successful. According to FT, the fund reported at the end of June that it had $187 million of unrealized gains on a $342 million portfolio. The company has also enjoyed millions of dollars in dividends. This became an excellent hedge against the risks and downturns in the publication industry, which has crushed many publications as they scramble to earn the elusive advertising revenue.However, some believe the Daily Journal's strategy of amassing Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) shares throughout 2021 was extremely bad, as the fund has suffered huge losses from that investment this year. The fund was buying huge stakes in the Chinese company when Chinese regulators were getting ready to punish the ecommerce company. Several hedge funds started exiting Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in 2021. But Munger was late. Reports also suggest that Alibaba was Munger's personal choice and it was his decision to pile into the Chinese company.Unlike his friend and partner Warren Buffett, who has a fairly diversified portfolio, Munger's investment portfolio has just five stocks as of the end of the second quarter.The Daily Journal, being a public company, has suffered in 2022 as its stock tanked over 20% year to date as of October 31.Charlie Munger Stock Portfolio: 5 Biggest PositionsCharlie MungerOur MethodologyFor this article we picked the top holdings of Charlie Munger based on his fund the Daily Journal's second quarter portfolio.Charlie Munger Stock Portfolio: 5 Biggest Positions5. POSCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PKX)Charlie Munger’s hedge fund made no change in its holding in the South Korean Steel company Posco. The fund owned 9,745 shares of the company which had a value of $357,000 at the end of June. The company recently said that it expects it Q3 operating profit to decline by more than 70% on a year-over-year basis, mainly because of Typhoon Hinnamnor, which affected the company’s steel mills. On a year-to-date basis the stock has lost 24%.Among the notable hedge funds having sizable stakes in the company include Richard S. Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management, Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital and Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP. A total of 8 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in the company at the end of the second quarter.4. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)Like his friend and partner Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger is also a fan of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB). At the end of the June quarter, Munger’s hedge fund owned 140,000 shares of the company. The total worth of these shares was $5.7 million. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) recently received all required approvals for the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank's core regional banking franchise from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (OTCPK:MBFJF) (MUFG). The deal, which is expected to close by December 1, will bring one million customers for U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and around 190,000 small business customers on the West Coast.  In its third quarter results, the bank beat the Street’s revenue estimates by $130 million. Average loans in the period jumped 13.5% as compared to the same quarter last year. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)'s results were helped by a sharp rise in net interest income, loan and deposit growth as well as higher interest rates.U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) presents an attractive buying opportunity as it has lost 30% year to date. Its PE ratio is now under 10. It has a strong dividend yield of over 4% and the company has increased its payout consistently for the last 10 years.At the end of the June quarter, 43 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in the company, compared to 40 in the period earlier.Here is what ClearBridge Investments Dividend Strategy has to say about U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We have increased our exposure to interest-rate sensitive banks by adding to existing positions in U.S. Bancorp.”3. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)  has been featuring in Charlie Munger’s portfolio for several quarters. Charlie Munger’s fund reported owning 300,000 Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)  shares as of the end of the second quarter. The total worth of these shares was $24 million. Earlier this year, Munger cut his stake in Alibaba in half. As of the end of the first quarter, Munger’s hedge fund had owned just 300,000 American depositary shares in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), down from a whopping 602,060 shares at the end of last year.In late September, Citi said in a note to investors that while Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)  has improved its operational efficiency, rising Covid cases and lockdown could hurt the company. Citi’s analyst Alicia Yap cut her revenue estimates for Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)  by 0.6% for fiscal 2023 but raised non-GAAP profit estimates by 15.2%. The analyst has a Buy rating on the stock.Hedge fund sentiment for Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)  is showing signs of strength. As of the end of the second quarter, of the 895 funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 106 had stakes in the company, compared to 100 funds in the previous quarter. Ken Fisher has a $1.65 billion stake in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) .Here is what Mawer Investment Management has to say about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Other companies that have seen declines include those that have been impacted by macroeconomic uncertainty in China. Both Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) have reported results that are negative fundamentally, and while both have been under pressure from new competition, the recent results are also a reflection of the economic state in China.” Click to continue reading and see Charlie Munger Stock Portfolio: 2 Biggest Positions.Suggested articles:11 Best Nanocap Stocks To Invest In12 Best Future Stocks To Buy12 Best New Stocks To Buy NowDisclosure: None.

12,c2ca5484-d145-3cc8-8c1c-2d68437a2064,USB,2022-11-10,Bet on These Equity ETFs to Follow Warren Buffett,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bet-equity-etfs-warren-buffett-180006876.html,1668016806,STORY,"['USB', 'AAPL', 'USB-PQ', 'CVX', 'HPQ', 'KBWB']","[Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has turned a winner this year despite wild stock market gyrations. The world’s richest people including Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos have seen their net worth nosediving in 2022 — except for Warren Buffett.Per a Motley Fool article, due to an acquisition in 1998 of reinsurance company General Re, Buffett's company owns a specialty investment firm known as New England Asset Management (NEAM). Although Buffett isn't directly involved in NEAM's investment portfolio, the securities NEAM buys are, eventually, owned by Buffett's company.Interestingly, majority of NEAM’s portfolio is concentrated on five stocks as of June-end, namely Apple (AAPL), U.S. Bancorp (USB), Bank of America (BAC), HP Inc. (HPQ) and Chevron Corporation (CVX), per the Motley Fool.Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few ETF strategies that could be followed if you are a fan of Warren Buffet.Apple: 47.24% of Invested AssetsApple AAPL is a key holding of Berkshire’s portfolio, making up more than 45% of Berkshire’s portfolio by market value. The Oracle of Omaha investor now owns over 5% of outstanding the Apple stock.There is a set of consumers who always choose to buy Apple products irrespective of inflationary pressure. In 2017, Buffett indicated that the Apple stock is a buy candidate as consumers ‘want the product’ despite its prices.This gives Apple the leeway to pass on the rising costs to consumers (which won’t hurt sales) due to sheer brand name. And Apple is now paying off to Buffett.Despite massive tech crash due to big tech earnings woes and rising rates, Apple has lost the least (down 6.4%) past month among famous FAAMG group. Facebook or Meta lost 9.7% past month, Alphabet (GOOG) is off 14.5%, Microsoft has shed about 9.4% and Amazon retreated 24.7% past month.Plus, Information Technology business normally does not require recurrent capital investments, which makes it an inflation-friendly investment. Hence, one can bet on Apple ETFs like Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC and Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT).Story continuesU.S. Bancorp: 13.76% of Invested AssetsWarren Buffett is a big fan of bank stock. Regional bank U.S. Bancorp USB make up about 13.8% of invested assets at the end of June and has been a continuous holding in NEAM's portfolio for more than two decades. USB is up 4.6% past month.The company has a decent earnings surprise history. The company’s strong loan and deposit balances are positives. U.S. Bancorp’s decent liquidity position is likely to support capital-deployment plans. USB has about 11% exposure to iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF IAT and 7.7% focus on Invesco KBW Bank ETF KBWB.Bank of America: 11.96% of Invested AssetsYet another big holding of NEAM is Bank of America BAC, which Berkshire Hathaway also bets big on. Bank of America's third-quarter 2022 results were primarily aided by higher rates and loan growth. The opening of new financial centers, enhancement in digital capabilities and cost-saving efforts are expected to keep aiding the company’s financials. Bank of America has 8.92% exposure Invesco KBW Bank ETF (KBWB) and 7.36% focus on iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF IYG.HP: 9.12% of Invested AssetsLike Buffett, New England Asset Management's investment team is also charmed by with HP's HPQ capital return program. The company increased its base annual payout by 29% in 2021, and has been aggressively repurchasing its common stock. HP has 10.97% exposure to Invesco S&amp;P SmallCap Energy ETF PSCE.Chevron: 5.26% of Invested AssetsThe energy supermajor is considered one of the best placed integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production growth, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin. Chevron’s CVX Noble Energy takeover expanded its footprint in the region and the DJ Basin along with the addition of cash generating offshore assets in Israel. In shareholder friendly moves, the integrated major recently hiked its dividend and boosted the stock repurchase program. Considering all of these factors, Wall Street expects the company’s EPS to grow 132.8% this year.Chevron has 19.48% exposure to Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLE and 16.75% focus on iShares U.S. Energy ETF IYE.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It comes as no surprise, then, that he doesn't take any personal credit for being named to the Twin Cities Business 2022 Notable Military Veteran Executive list.""What this award truly reflects is the work of the Proud to Serve team and what we've all accomplished,"" said Lippert, executive vice president for Payment Services Operations, who also leads the U.S. Bank Proud to Serve business resource group (BRG).Proud to Serve, an employee-led group, plays a leading role in shaping how the company supports military and veteran employees, customers and community members. The group has more than 5,000 members across the country, and its partnership with human resources led to U.S. Bank enhancing its military-related leave for U.S.-based employees earlier this year. The strength of Proud to Serve is one of several reasons cited by Military Times when ranking U.S. Bank as one of the ‘Best for Vets"" employers each year since the list debuted in 2010.The collaboration with Lippert and the Proud to Serve BRG ""has enabled us to deliver an optimal experience for our active duty, veteran employees, as well as those who are now retired from the military,"" said Elcio Barcelos, chief human resources officer at U.S. Bank.The Twin Cities Business list features ""veterans who have forged remarkable civilian careers following their military service."" Lippert, a former submarine officer in the Navy, joined U.S. Bank in 2020 to lead the Payment Services Operations team. His team is responsible for customer experience and operations across three lines of business - Retail Payment Solutions, Elavon and Corporate Payments and Treasury Services in the U.S. and Europe.Lippert's military roots run deep. His father is a retired Vice Admiral who served 38 years in the Navy and his grandfather fought on an aircraft carrier in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the largest naval battle of World War II. Lippert's military career included five deployments on the U.S.S. MAINE (SSBN-741), a ballistic missile, nuclear-powered submarine, and a shore tour of teaching nuclear physics at the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command.Story continues""There are so many practices that I learned and used in the submarine force I use in my day-to-day work, especially in operations,"" he said.Lippert's military service has prepared him for the unexpected, like a global pandemic. In March 2020, he wrote a piece for LinkedIn that applied his lessons as a submarine officer on long undersea deployments to the sudden shift people faced in social distancing.Under Lippert's leadership, Proud to Serve provides personal welcome emails for new veteran and military employees from leaders who are also veterans or servicemembers and a checklist to help them acclimate and connect. The group also provides input into the specialized products and services for veteran and military customers, as well as community initiatives such as partnering with military service organizations to donate off-lease vehicles to veterans and mortgage-free homes to wounded veterans.It's important to create a work environment that's attractive to veterans and active military, Lippert said, because ""veterans bring a diversity of thought that is driven by their unique set of experiences.""When you have that diversity of thought, you come up with better outcomes for our employees and customers,"" he said.Learn more about U.S. Bank hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.usbank.com/index.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/724747/US-Bank-Exec-Honored-for-Forging-Remarkable-Career-After-Serving-in-Navy]"

Walmart stock has held up better than the broader market and investors are hoping a strong third quarter could give WMT stock a boost into positive territory this year. Walmart’s report will also show if the company can fend off rising competition from Amazon AMZN and Target TGT during an economic crunch with the latter also reporting earnings next week. To combat the competition Walmart has strived to advance its e-commerce business along with its retail stores.The Basics Walmart is well known for its “rollback” prices, which is significant as consumers look to lower costs. However, Wall Street will be scoping the company’s bottom line to see if these exclusive discounts are beneficial to Walmart during the current economic environment with operating costs rising for most businesses.In addition to running its core supercenters along with Sam’s Clubs domestically, the company has expanded its international operations with a presence in Canada, Chile, China, India, Mexico, Africa, and Central America. Walmart has also made the push into healthcare launching Walmart Health in 2019 to continue diversifying its business which also includes a growing subscription service.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ3 Outlook The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WMT’s Q3 earnings is $1.31 per share, which would be a decline of -9% from Q3 2021. Sales for Q3 are expected to be up 5% at $147.41 billion. This may be a slight indication that operating costs are weighing down the company’s bottom line in a tougher overall economic environment.Earnings estimates are slightly up from $1.30 at the beginning of the quarter. Year over year, WMT earnings are also expected to decline -9% in fiscal 2023, but rise 11% in FY24 at $6.52 per share. Top line growth is expected, with sales projected to be up 5% in fiscal 2023 and another 3% in FY24 to $618.97 billion.Story continuesPerformance &amp; Valuation Year to date, WMT is only down -3% to outperform the S&amp;P 500’s -21% and roughly match the Retail-Supermarkets Market’s +1%. Over the last decade, WMT is up +156% when including its dividend to beat its Zacks Subindustry’s +148% but lag the benchmark. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWMT’s historical performance has been very respectable and investors are hoping this continues as the economic downturn is favorable for omnichannel players like Walmart that offer consumers options to cut back on expenses.Trading around $139 per share, WMT has a forward P/E of 24.4X. This is well above the industry average of 11.6X but Walmart has shown itself to be a leader. WMT does trade at a discount to its decade-high of 28.1X and slightly above the median of 18X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineGoing into its Q3 earnings WMT lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its Retail-Supermarkets Industry is in the top 38% of over 250 Zacks Industries. Walmart could use strong beats on both its top and bottom lines. This could be a catalyst for WMT stock and show the company can continue benefiting in the current market environment.Wall Street will be monitoring Walmart’s ability to manage rising operating costs as the company’s business model offers many of its products at a discount to its competitors through its “rollback” prices.Investors may be rewarded for holding the stock as the current economic downturn could shift more consumers to Walmart. Plus, WMT offers a solid 1.57% annual dividend yield at $2.24 per share and the Average Zacks Price Target suggests 7% upside from current levels.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

18,7246bbd5-1990-3aad-82f5-4fe806f3d1b8,WMT,2022-11-10,13 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks to Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-best-consumer-staples-dividend-162141293.html,1668010901,STORY,"['COST', 'CL', 'MDLZ', 'PEP', 'ADM', 'WMT', 'TGT', 'HSY', 'KO', 'PG']","[In this article, we will discuss 13 best consumer staples dividend stocks to buy now. You can skip our detailed analysis of the sector and its performance this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. The sizzling inflation and continuous interest rate hikes have taken nearly every sector into its fold this year. However, the consumer staples sector is performing better than the rest of the market because these companies exhibit strong demand for their products even during weak economic conditions. The growing demand gives the sector hedging capabilities against inflation, which makes investors pick these stocks over other risky industries. Some of the well-known names in the consumer staples sector include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP).Consumer staples companies benefitted a lot during the pandemic due to increased consumer spending, especially through digital channels. According to a report by JPMorgan, e-commerce represented 12% of gross sales in the first six months of 2020 and showed a 60% growth from the prior-year period (see the biggest e-commerce companies). The shift in the companies’ way of running businesses has further expanded the sector as people now have access to various online systems. This year’s returns have also shown that shares of the consumer staple companies have trounced their counterparts. The S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples index declined by 6.22% year-to-date, compared with a 29.6% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology index. Another report by Fidelity Investments shows that the consumer staples sector delivered a 14% annualized return in the last three years ending March 2022, compared with an 11% and 13.2% return for the energy and industrial sectors.Due to their non-cyclic nature, consumer staples have stable earnings, consistent cash flows, and strong balance sheets, which are very important from a dividend perspective. In the current market, investors prefer safe stocks that would help them to stay afloat and generate stable income. For this reason, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks in the sector.Story continues13 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks to Buy NowCopyright: jetcityimage / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are from the consumer staples sector and pay dividends to shareholders. We analyzed these stocks through their dividend policies, balance sheets, and overall fundamentals. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yields as of November 8.13. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Dividend Yield as of November 8: 0.73%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American multinational big-box store company. In October, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $525 with an Overweight rating on the shares, appreciating the company's unit growth and market share gains.In fiscal Q4 2022, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) reported revenue of $72 billion, which showed a 15% growth from the same period last year. The company ended the quarter with over $10.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Its total current assets amounted to over $32.6 billion, compared with $29.5 billion in the prior-year quarter.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 18 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks in the consumer staples sector.

Here is what the firm has to say:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”12.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)7.

(WMT) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-inc-wmt-trending-stock-140002909.html,1668002402,STORY,['WMT'],"[Walmart (WMT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest retailer have returned +7.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry, which Walmart falls in, has gained 11%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Walmart is expected to post earnings of $1.31 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.85 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -9.4%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.52 indicates a change of +11.5% from what Walmart is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Walmart.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for WMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Walmart, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $147.41 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $600.74 billion and $618.97 billion estimates indicate +4.9% and +3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalmart reported revenues of $152.86 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.4%. EPS of $1.77 for the same period compares with $1.78 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $151.41 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.95%. The EPS surprise was +10.63%.Over the last four quarters, Walmart surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walmart is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walmart. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Cisco Systems (CSCO) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.85 a share seven days away from its upcoming earnings release on November 16, 2022.CSCO has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.46%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.85 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.84.CSCO is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Microchip Technology (MCHP) as well.Microchip Technology, which is readying to report earnings on February 2, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.55 a share, and MCHP is 85 days out from its next earnings report.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Microchip Technology is $1.54, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.58%.CSCO and MCHP's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Expectations for future meetings are divided.The U.S. dollar firmed on Thursday, with the euro dipping 0.6% to $0.9947 while the yen was steady 146.45 per dollar..The greenback hit a 32-year high of 151.94 yen in October and a 20-year peak against the euro in September when the European common currency dropped as low as $0.9528.The benchmark 10 year U.S. Treasury yield was at 4.1%, a touch lower on the day, while European government bond yields were little changed.The looming CPI data meant markets largely looked through the outcome of the U.S. mid-term elections. Republicans were edging closer to securing a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives while control of the Senate hung in the balance.CHINA's COVID SURGEAnother factor for markets is that China is again grappling with a COVID-19 surge, with the southern metropolis of Guangzhou reporting thousands of cases. Chinese blue-chips lost 0.7% and the Hong Kong benchmark fell 1.7%.Apple Inc supplier and iPhone assembler Foxconn said on Thursday it expected flattish revenue in the fourth quarter, as the company grapples with COVID curbs at a major factory in China's Zhengzhou industrial hub.In the crypto world, bitcoin rose 5% to $16,666 on Thursday, steadying after plunging sharply for two straight sessions to as low as $15,632, its lowest level since late 2020.Binance, the world's biggest crypto exchange, said late on Wednesday that it had decided not to acquire smaller rival FTX, which has grappled with a severe liquidity crunch and warned it faces bankruptcy without more capital.In commodities, oil prices edged down, after tumbling around 3% in the previous session on fears about demand from China and rising U.S. crude stocks.U.S. crude oil futures were 0.7% lower at $85.23 per barrel, while Brent crude futures lost 0.33% to $92.28.Gold was steady with the spot price at $1,707.3 per ounce.(Reporting by Stella Qiu in Sydney and Alun John in London ; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise, Kirsten Donovan)]"

The release of millions of barrels of predominantly sour crude has left the U.S. Gulf Coast, home to the world's largest heavy oil refining centre, awash in crude of similar quality to WCS.In September, BP-Husky Toledo, Ohio, refinery operated by BP Plc, which processes up to 90,000 barrels per day (bpd) of heavy crude, shut following a fatal fire.The Canadian oil market was slow to react to the Toledo outage, according to a Calgary-based industry source, and as other U.S. refineries went into scheduled turnarounds cutting demand further, WCS-WTI differentials collapsed.Other factors weighing on WCS include competition from cheap Russian crude on the global market and high natural gas prices that made refining heavy oil more expensive.Meanwhile, output in Alberta, home of the oil sands and Canada's largest crude-producing province, hit a record 3.88 million barrels per day in September, up 9.6% from the same period a year earlier, according to ATB Financial.HOW DOES THIS COMPARE TO PREVIOUS BLOWOUTS?WCS hit a record discount of more than $50 a barrel below WTI in October 2018 when a lack of space on export pipelines and refinery maintenance led to a glut of crude in Alberta.However, unlike previous WCS blowouts, the current deep discount is led by weak downstream demand, rather than pipeline bottlenecks. Since Enbridge Inc's Line 3 replacement project started operating last year, Canada's export capacity has been broadly in line with production.Story continuesWHO IS MOST AFFECTED?Pure-play heavy oil producers without refining capacity are most impacted by weak WCS prices. These include MEG Energy and Athabasca Oil, according to RBC Capital Markets.WHAT NEXT?A number of industry analysts and company CEOs, including Cenovus Energy CEO Alex Pourbaix, say they expect a deep WCS discount to persist throughout the first half of 2023.The U.S. SPR releases are due to wind up at year-end, but upheaval in the global crude market due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine is clouding the outlook for WCS.""I can't say it's very bullish as long as Russia is still being Russia,"" one broker said.

For the third quarter, the Madison Dividend Income Fund (Class Y) declined -7.8%, compared to the S&amp;P 500 Index, Russell 1000 Value Index, and Lipper Equity Income peer group declines of -4.9%, -5.6%, -5.8%, respectively. On a year-to-date basis, the Fund declined -16.9%, which outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index and Russell 1000 Value Index returns of -23.9% and -17.8%, respectively, compared to the Lipper Equity Income peer group return of -16.0%. Try to spare some time to check the fund’s top 5 holdings for you to have an idea about their best stock picks this 2022.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Madison Dividend Income Fund mentioned Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and explained its insights for the company. Founded in 1935, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is a New York, New York-based multinational investment management and financial services company with a $144.4 billion market capitalization. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) delivered a -13.12% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are down by -14.47%. The stock closed at $85.28 per share on November 08, 2022.Here is what Madison Dividend Income Fund has to say about Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""This quarter we are highlighting Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) as a relative yield example in the Financial sector. MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results.

Operating expenses in the second quarter of Fiscal 2023 were $816 million on a reported basis.

Europe operating income in the second quarter was $135 million on both a reported basis and an adjusted basis. Adjusted Europe operating margin was 27.3%, down 530 basis points to last year, driven by increased foreign currency headwinds, freight expenses and timing of marketing investments in the quarter.

Inventory growth primarily reflected earlier receipts and higher goods-in-transit to mitigate global supply chain delays and meet strong consumer demand along with increased product costs and continued elevation in product mix.The Company repurchased approximately $170 million of Class A Common Stock in the second quarter.Full Year Fiscal 2023 and Third Quarter OutlookThe Company's outlook is based on its best assessment of the current macroeconomic environment, including ongoing global supply chain and other inflationary pressures, foreign currency volatility, the war in Ukraine, COVID-19 variants and other COVID-related disruptions. The full year Fiscal 2023 and third quarter guidance excludes restructuring-related and other net charges, as described in the ""Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures"" section of this press release.For Fiscal 2023, the Company continues to expect constant currency revenues to increase approximately high-single digits to last year, or about 8%, on a 52-week comparable basis. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 730 basis points in Fiscal 2023. On a 53-week comparable basis, Fiscal 2023 revenue growth is still expected to be negatively impacted by approximately 100 basis points due to the absence of the 53rd week compared to the prior year.The Company expects operating margin for Fiscal 2023 at the low end of its previous range of 14.0% to 14.5% in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact operating margin by approximately 200 basis points in Fiscal 2023. This compares to operating margin of 13.1% on a 52-week comparable basis and 13.4% on a 53-week basis in the prior year, both on a reported basis. Gross margin is still expected to increase approximately 30 to 50 basis points in constant currency on a 52-week comparable basis, with stronger AUR and favorable product mix more than offsetting higher freight and product cost inflation. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact gross margins by approximately 170 basis points in Fiscal 2023.For the third quarter, the Company expects revenue to increase low- to mid-single digits in constant currency to last year. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by approximately 780 basis points. The third quarter and second half outlook reflects increased caution around consumer sentiment in Europe and North America.Operating margin for the third quarter is expected to be in a range of 17.3% to 17.8% in constant currency, driven primarily by gross margin expansion. Foreign currency is expected to negatively impact third quarter operating margin by approximately 180 basis points and gross margin by approximately 170 basis points.Third quarter and full year Fiscal 2023 tax rates are both expected to be in the range of 25% to 26%, assuming a continuation of current tax laws.The Company moderated its plan for capital expenditures for Fiscal 2023 to approximately $250 million to $275 million based on timing of projects.Conference CallAs previously announced, the Company will host a conference call and live online webcast today, Thursday, November 10, 2022, at 9:00 A.M.

NWSA witnessed revenue declines across all its segments except Dow Jones.Shares of this diversified media and information services company have lost 7.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 10.4%.Quarterly DetailsNews Corporation delivered adjusted quarterly earnings of 12 cents a share. The bottom-line figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents and plunged 47.8% from adjusted earnings of 23 cents reported in the last fiscal year’s comparable period.Total revenues of $2,478 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,568 million and dipped 1% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s levels. The decline was mainly due to negative foreign currency fluctuations and lower revenues at the Book Publishing segment on account of lower physical book sales from Amazon, partly offset by higher revenues in the Dow Jones segment. Foreign currency fluctuations had a 6% negative impact on revenues. Adjusted revenues rose 3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTotal EBITDA decreased 15% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level to $350 million, thanks to higher costs due to inflationary pressures and lower sales. Foreign currency fluctuations had a $23-million negative impact on total segment EBITDA. Adjusted total segment EBITDA fell 13%.Segment DetailsRevenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment slipped 1% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading to $421 million, induced by a 5% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted segment revenues increased 3%.Revenues in Move dipped 6% to $169 million due to lower real-estate revenues, somewhat offset by increased advertising revenues. Real Estate revenues, contributing 84% to total Move revenues, fell 9% due to the tough macroeconomic landscape, including higher household interest rates. The referral model generated 30% of the overall Move revenues in the reported quarter. Move’s internal data shows that average monthly unique users of Realtor.com’s web and mobile sites fell 11% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s tally to 86 million. Lead volume also dropped 32%.Revenues at the REA Group inched up 2% to $252 million, driven by greater depth penetration, growth in national listings and higher Australian residential revenues on price increases. The upside was somewhat offset by 9% foreign currency headwinds and lower financial services revenues.The Subscription Video Services segment’s revenues were $502 million, down 2% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals. Foreign currency fluctuations adversely impacted the segment’s revenues by 8%. Increased revenues from Kayo and BINGE as well as higher commercial and advertising revenues were partly offset by fewer residential broadcast subscribers. Adjusted segment’s revenues rose 6% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level to $542 million.Foxtel Group streaming subscription revenues represented nearly 25% of the overall circulation and subscription revenues compared with 19% in the prior year. Foxtel’s total closing paid subscribers were 4.5 million as of Sep 30, 2022, reflecting an increase of 16% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level. The upside can be attributed to an increase in BINGE and Kayo subscribers, partly offset by lower residential broadcast subscribers. Broadcast subscriber churn improved slightly to 14.2% from 14% in the previous fiscal year. Broadcast ARPU grew 1% from the year-earlier fiscal quarter’s reading to A$83 (US$57).This presently Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) player’s revenues at the Dow Jones segment rose 16% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level to $515 million. This includes contributions of $34 million and $18 million from the buyouts of OPIS and CMA, respectively. Adjusted segment revenues grew 6% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level owing to higher circulation and subscription revenues from digital subscription gains and growth in the Risk &amp; Compliance products, and increased digital advertising revenues. The segment’s digital revenues contributed 79% to total revenues compared with 75% seen in the last fiscal year.Circulation and subscription revenues improved 19% during the fiscal quarter under discussion. Circulation revenues rose 5%, driven by consistent strength in the digital-only subscriptions at The Wall Street Journal. Professional information business revenues jumped 40%, mainly driven by the OPIS and CMA acquisitions and an improvement in the Risk &amp; Compliance products, offset by negative currency fluctuations. Digital circulation revenues represented 68% of the circulation revenues.Advertising revenues increased 4%, primarily owing to an 11% rise in digital advertising revenues, partly offset by a 6%-drop in print advertising revenues.

Within the segment, revenues at News Corp Australia rose 1%, while the metric at News UK declined 9%. Adjusted revenues for the segment climbed 6%.Circulation and subscription revenues dipped 6% due to lower print volumes and a 12% adverse impact from foreign currency fluctuations.Advertising revenues dipped 4% due to negative foreign currency fluctuations of 9% because of a fall in print advertising at News UK and lower revenues at Wireless Group, partly due to the absence of the Euro 2020.Digital revenues contributed 36% to the News Media segment’s revenues compared with 33% in the year-ago fiscal quarter.

56,e6ad9b7f-36cd-3e07-bc07-d45977c77343,NWS,2022-11-10,4 Stocks to Watch in a Prospering Entertainment Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-watch-prospering-entertainment-141302197.html,1668003182.0,STORY,"['WWE', 'NWSA', '^GSPC']","[The Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry is benefiting from a spike in demand for digital entertainment, fueled by lingering capacity and operational limitations in movie theaters, theme parks and cruise lines. Increased consumption of media, music and news over the web triggered by the work-and-learn-at-home wave has been a key catalyst for industry participants like News Corporation NWSA, World Wrestling Entertainment WWE, iQIYI IQ and CuriosityStream CURI. Companies have been focusing on a superior product strategy and prudent capital investments. Steady recovery in the advertising spending environment and resumption of production pipelines bode well for film and television production companies.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry comprises companies involved in film and TV production, distribution and exhibition. The main activities of the industry participants include the production and distribution of entertainment content to theaters, TV networks, video-on-demand platforms, streaming services and other exhibitors. Imax offers entertainment technology and specializes in motion picture technologies and presentations. Industry participants produce and distribute motion pictures for theatrical and straight-to-video releases besides TV programming. These players are heavily dependent on the box-office performance of their films, both domestically and internationally, the number of film releases and the ratings of TV shows.3 Film and Television Production Industry Trends in FocusOver-the-Top Services Gaining Prominence: Companies involved in content creation are looking to distribute content through over-the-top services to leverage the popularity of their franchises. With this, they are looking to provide exclusive content and a differentiated experience. However, streaming companies are increasingly producing original and award-winning feed to reduce licensing costs and excessive dependence on third-party content providers. This is likely to hurt industry participants’ content distribution strategy.Story continuesBinge-Watching Driving Consumption: Factors such as binge-watching, deepening Internet penetration and advancement in mobile, video, and wireless technologies have got viewers glued to small screens. In order to keep pace with new consumption patterns, industry participants are turning to digital content distribution. The emergence of digital capabilities is making consumer data easily available to companies. With the use of AI tools, production houses are gaining a better understanding of user preference. This is helping them produce content that strikes a chord with viewers. However, increasing spending on content and sales &amp; marketing is hurting profitability due to stiff competition from streaming players.Technological Advancement Aids Prospects: Exhibitors are turning to highly efficient and cost-effective technologies like laser-based projection systems to enhance image quality and the entire movie experience. Additionally, the use of technologies like motion seating, immersive audio systems and interactive movies among others is expected to enhance the viewing experience. The increasing adoption of AR and VR technologies bodes well for industry participants. However, the evolution of alternative motion picture distribution channels such as home video, pay-per-view, streaming services, video-on-demand, Internet and syndicated and broadcast television is hurting exhibitors.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 1.2%, which is fairly typical for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft Microsoft's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Before making this announcement, Microsoft was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 49.9%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 20% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendMicrosoft Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.80 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.72. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 13% over that duration. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Microsoft has impressed us by growing EPS at 22% per year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.Microsoft Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Microsoft is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for Microsoft that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Is Microsoft not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

Getting kids interested in the stock market and then investing in different firms might be the perfect way to do that. For children, it is perhaps best to get started with big brands that are household names. Some of these, like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), are likely to be safe investments for kids as they start learning about the market. This is also an excellent time to buy these stocks as they are on sale and are likely to deliver positive returns over the long-term.Kids usually pick up financial habits from their parents, and these stocks are some of the best investments for adults as well. Children can learn about budgeting, saving, and investing as they experiment with stocks. Investing takes a good amount of sacrifice and patience as well, both traits that are critical for the development of kids. One of the best possible gifts that a parent can give their child is money management lessons and investing in the stock market is a fun way of delivering such a gift.  Our MethodologyThe companies that make products for children were selected for the list. The analyst ratings of these firms and the latest updates related to them are also discussed to provide some additional context. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.12 Best Kid-Friendly Stocks to Buy NowPixabay/Public DomainBest Kid-Friendly Stocks to Buy Now12.

The business enjoyed strong engagement last year with players of EA games spending 20% more time than even during 2020, helped by the delayed sales of the PS5 console. A potentially important development is the ongoing negotiation between EA and FIFA regarding the licensing of the FIFA brand for the EA football game. Strongly worded public statements have been slung from both parties as part of the negotiation process, but this could certainly be an opportunity for EA.”9.

We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”7. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65  CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) provides health services in the United States. On November 1, Walgreens Boots, Walmart and CVS health revealed that they have reached a tentative agreement to pay more than $12 billion for the sale of opioid painkillers to states and local governments. CVS will pay $4.9 billion, Walgreens minimum $4 billion and Walmart will pay $3 billion.On October 20, BofA analyst Michael Cherny maintained a Buy rating on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) stock and lowered the price target to $118 from $122, noting that the company expects Q3 results to be generally steady with well-understood near-term tailwinds and headwinds.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Connecticut-based investment firm AQR Capital Management is a leading shareholder in CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) with 3.4 million shares worth more than $312.7 million.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Vltava Fund, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109     The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) together with its subsidiaries, operates as an entertainment company worldwide.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the best kid-friendly stocks to buy now according to elite investors. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Oakmark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the most beloved consumer companies in the world. Its media business has a rich library of intellectual property, which provides a powerful engine for creating new content across the Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars brands. This content also contributes to the success of Disney’s theme parks, which generated nearly half the company’s earnings and grew more than 10% annually in the decade before the pandemic. Shares have fallen nearly 50% over the past year as investors worried about the company’s ability to transition its media business to a direct-to-consumer streaming world. This transition has required management to make investments in its Disney+ streaming service that are depressing profitability today. However, we believe these investments will ultimately produce attractive returns as Disney+ continues to grow subscribers and increase pricing over time. As a result, we were able to purchase shares at a substantial discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Kid-Friendly Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested Articles:10 Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look Back12 Best Reddit Stocks To Invest In12 Best Financial Dividend Stocks to Invest InDisclosure.

Get it sent directly to your inbox every Wednesday by 4 p.m. ET. SubscribeWednesday, Nov. 9, 2022The holidays won't save the game industry from its terrible yearVideo game sales around the world have slumped in 2022, and experts predict that even the holiday shopping season won't rescue the industry from its terrible year.The pandemic lockdowns powered growth in video games last year and in 2020, as couch-bound gamers searched for a distraction from COVID-19. From 2019 to 2021, the global video game content and services market grew 26%, jumping from $151 billion to $191 billion, according to Ampere Analysis.That growth cooled in 2022, as the pandemic eased and the economy faltered. Microsoft (MSFT), Sony (SONY), EA (EA), and Take-Two (TTWO) each saw year-over-year sales declines. Nintendo (NTDOY) says it expects to sell 2 million fewer Switch consoles this year due to continued chip shortages, though it raised its sales forecast thanks to the weaker Japanese yen. Even mobile gaming sales are declining, with NPD Group predicting a 9% drop in the third quarter of 2023 from the same time a year earlier.While the holiday season traditionally brings huge game sales, experts predict a muted fourth quarter thanks to a lack of new, exciting content. We'd usually see hot titles for the holidays, but pandemic-related delays have pushed many games into 2023. Yes, the pandemic has eased enough to get people off of their couches — but it's still throwing snags in the supply chain. Those disruptions could strike a blow to an industry that's already suffering from year-over-year comparisons to its pandemic-driven highs in 2021.“This holiday season is set up to be a natural let-down just from a quantity perspective,” Jefferies analyst Andrew Uerkwitz told Yahoo Finance. “If you look at the number of games last year to this year, it's actually down. There's been over 100 games delayed over the last 24 months. And that's publicly announced delays.”Story continuesFew games, but plenty of eager gamersGame companies traditionally release their biggest titles in the lead-up to the holidays to get their hits out during the busiest shopping season of the year.A man walks an advertisement of Nintendo Switch at an electronics retail chain store in Tokyo on Oct. 13, 2021. (AP Photo/Koji Sasahara)Last year, the gaming giants fired off a host of big-name titles including “Halo Infinite,” “Battlefield 2042,” “Metroid Dread,” and “Call of Duty Vanguard” to name a few. While “Battlefield” and “Call of Duty” underperformed expectations, the titles were still among the best performing of the year in terms of U.S. sales. This year will be different.“As it happens, this holiday season we don't have a very big release schedule,” Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told Yahoo Finance. “There is no ‘Cyberpunk.’ There is no ‘Battlefield.’ We have the games that come out every year, which are ‘FIFA’ and ‘Call of Duty.’ ”“God of War Ragnarok” and “The Callisto Protocol,” two highly anticipated games that launch Wednesday and in December, respectively, could help improve sales, but there’s no guarantee that they’ll lift the entire industry.To be sure, people are still looking for games to play. Activision Blizzard’s “Call of Duty Modern Warfare II,” which came out in October, sold $1 billion worth of copies in its first 10 days on the market. Over at EA, some 10.3 million players jumped onto “FIFA 23” in the game’s first week of availability in September.Even so, EA cut its full-year net bookings forecast on the strong U.S. dollar, which is hurting overseas sales, from between $7.89 billion and $8.1 billion to between $7.65 billion and $7.85 billion.Activision Blizzard sold $1 billion worth of copies of 'Call of Duty' in 10 days this year. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File)Gamers will have to wait until next year to get their hands on new titles. According to Uerkwitz, more than 100 games that were initially scheduled to be released in time for the holiday season are delayed until sometime in 2023 either due to quality checks or because of COVID-related slowdowns.“And that's publicly announced delays,” Uerkwitz explained. “That's not games that quietly got delayed internally or whatnot. And so just a lack of quantity of high-profile AAA games I think has been a large part of the year-over-year decline in PC and console.”Then there’s the drop in mobile games sales. According to SensorTower, mobile game spending dropped 6% year-over-year to $21.1 billion in Q1 2022 and 6.9% year-over-year in Q2 to $20.1 billion.“The reason that 2022 will be down overall, isn't necessarily that consoles and PCs have had a rough year, although they had, it's because mobile gaming appears to be on track to drop 6% or 8%,” Lewis Ward, IDC research director of gaming, eSports and VR/AR, told Yahoo Finance. “If that happens, even if consoles and PCs had a great year, we could probably still be down year over year.”PS5 by PlayStation is displayed in a GameStop in Manhattan, New York, U.S., December 7, 2021. REUTERS/Andrew KellyThat doesn’t mean that the holiday season will be a complete bust. According to Pachter, if there is a year-over-year decline in sales, it will likely be somewhere in the 1% to 2% range. That said, even a small decline means that the overall downward sales trend for the year won’t change.A brighter 2023While the holiday season could be a let-down for the gaming industry, the year ahead should offer some relief despite high inflation and foreign exchange headwinds. That's because a large number of big-name games are expected to hit the market in 2023.“Assuming recessionary concerns dissipate, and inflation gets back under a reasonable level of control or back to a baseline norm of low single digits in 2023, the baseline that the gaming industry was on before COVID will probably reassert itself,” Ward explained.High-profile games set to launch in 2023 include Nintendo’s “Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,” Ubisoft’s “Skull and Bones,” Activision Blizzard’s “Diablo 4,” Bethesda’s “Starfield,” and a slew of others.Those titles alone will likely sell millions of units. Toss in annual releases like “Madden” and gamers dropping their cash on online games like “Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0,” and 2023 will look far better than gaming’s terrible 2022.By Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

This is causing a disadvantage to its European rivals and is damaging the European cloud computing ecosystem.Along with Amazon, which is currently the leader in cloud computing services, this complaint has also been supported by French cloud provider OVHcloud and Italy-based Aruba SpA.Microsoft Faces Tough Scrutiny and Legal WoesThe antitrust allegations, however, don’t come as a surprise to Microsoft, as it has been facing numerous legal complaints in recent years.German cloud-storage company Nextcloud has shown concerns about Microsoft’s practice of linking products together. Last year, it filed a complaint with the EU about Microsoft’s practice of bundling its OneDrive storage product with the Windows operating system.The business-messaging app Slack also accused Microsoft in 2020 of trying to suppress competition by tying its Teams platform for business communication with its Office productivity software.Microsoft Corporation Price and ConsensusMicrosoft Corporation Price and ConsensusMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation QuoteBesides this, one of the biggest probes Microsoft is facing in the United Kingdom is its deal to acquire the gaming company, Activision Blizzard ATVI.The acquisition is facing an in-depth probe in the United Kingdom, which has entered the second phase of review with the Competition and Markets Authority, as they believe that this acquisition could hurt competition in gaming consoles, subscription services and cloud gaming if Microsoft refuses to give competitors access to Activision's best-selling games.This acquisition got Microsoft in a tussle with Sony SONY, which also offers cloud gaming through its PlayStation Plus subscription. The company raised concerns that the acquisition could influence people to switch from PlayStation to Xbox. Activision’s most popular game, the Call of Duty series, has been the best-selling game in its genre, and losing that to Microsoft could take away huge business from Sony.However, in response, Microsoft has promised to keep Call of Duty on the PlayStation for at least several more years beyond its current contract with Sony. It is also contemplating making it available on the Nintendo Switch console, where the game isn't currently available.This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has also shown its will to cooperate with the European Commission as and when required to address their concerns.Story continuesYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.On the brighter side, Microsoft achieved approval from Brazil’s competition authority as they stated that they operate in a highly dynamic and competitive industry and that the merger will not harm competition in any way.Saudi Arabia has also signed off on the deal, but it still awaits important decisions from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and authorities in the U.K. and the EU.Microsoft might face possible conditions imposed on the gaming deal by regulators, which compel them to keep access open to Call of Duty for longer and ensure that its rivals aren't getting a lesser version. Despite this, if the acquisition is successfully closed, it will be the largest in the history of the tech industry.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Safe Dividend Stocks with Over 3% Yield. Investors are flocking to dividend stocks this year amid the broader bloodbath that is crushing growth stocks. Dividend stocks that have a history of raising their payouts have become attractive as they provide some sort of security to investors who hungry for certainty as the Fed has no intention to slow interest rate hikes.Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal quoted Credit Suisse analysts, who said that high-dividend stocks have continued to outperform companies with lower payouts since 2020. The WSJ report also cited Max Wasserman, the founder of Miramar Capital, who said:“If I have a choice between you buying more of your stock or you giving me cash…I’d rather have the cash.""Analysts believe the popularity of dividend stocks is expected to continue into the next year as investors now prefer stocks that are paying stable payouts instead of growth companies that promise profits far into the future that is everything but certain. The same WSJ article mentioned that as of May 24, the S&amp;P 500 High Dividend index was up 3.6% this year, compared to a 13% decline for the S&amp;P 500 Buyback index in the same period.Beginner investors who have budget constraints are also piling into dividend ETFs, which provide more diversification and risk mitigation.Image by Steve Buissinne from PixabayMethodologyFor this article, we picked dividend stocks that have a yield of over 3% as of October 26. We have also mentioned the number of hedge funds having stakes in these companies based on Insider Monkey's database of 865 hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter this year. Our analysis has also indicated that hedge funds are preferring dividend stocks this year. They are also establishing large stakes in defensive players to prepare for a possible recession.Story continuesSafe Dividend Stock with Over 3% Yield10. Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O)Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) has become perhaps one of the most attractive dividend plays in 2022 for several reasons, the most important being the company’s monthly payouts. This monthly dividend stock, whose yield stands at over 4% as of October 26, has increased its dividend for 26 years now. The current macroeconomic uncertainty and inflation did not bar the company from breaking its dividend growth streak, as it announced a 0.2% increase in its dividend in October. Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) also announced recently that it invested about $1.8 billion in properties and properties under development or expansion in the third quarter, bringing its total investments to $5 billion.Of the 895 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 19 had stakes in the company as of the end of the June quarter, compared to 22 in the quarter earlier.Stuart J. Zimmer’s Zimmer Partners was the biggest stakeholder of the company at the end of June with a stake worth over $51 million.9. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA)Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is a high-yield dividend stock which has seen its payout increase consistently for the last 47 years. The stock’s dividend yield stands at about 5.4% as of October 26. In October, the stock jumped after the company posted strong fiscal Q4 results and also issued guidance for fiscal 2023. Revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter came in at $32.45 billion, beating estimates. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) increased its U.S. Healthcare fiscal year 2025 sales target to $11 billion to $12 billion, from the previous target of $9 billion to $10 billion. The segment is expected to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA by fiscal year 2024.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) also reiterated its expectations to achieve low-teens adjusted EPS growth in fiscal year 2025.Hedge funds continue to pile into this strong stock despite the macroeconomic volatility. 40 elite funds in the database of Insider Monkey were long WBA as of the end of the second quarter, compared to 38 funds in the previous quarter. Stephen Dubois' Camber Capital Management was the biggest stakeholder of the company at the end of the June quarter, as it owned a $107 million stake in the company.Here is what Aristotle Capital Management Global Equity has to say about Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company’s progress.”8. Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. (NYSE:TDS)Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. (NYSE:TDS) is a US-based telecommunications services company. While the company has a market cap of just $1.8 billion, its dividend yield stands at 4.48% and it has been increasing its dividend consistently for the last 48 years. In September, Citi included the stock among its top buys in the communications sector.Over the past 30 days, the stock is up 11%, as of October 26. Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. (NYSE:TDS) company saw an uptick in hedge fund sentiment in the second quarter. Of the 895 funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 16 funds reported having stakes in the company at the end of the quarter, compared to 12 funds in the previous quarter.Several notable hedge funds are major stakeholders of TDS, as of the end of the second quarter. For example, the biggest stakeholder of the company in our database was Mario Gabelli's GAMCO, which reported owning a $27 million stake in the company at the end of June this year.7. Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK)Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) is a Fortune 500 company that sells household and hardware products. The stock has a dividend yield of 4% as of October 26. This company has increased its dividend for 55 years without a break. Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) is operating in the power tools market and is exposed to the cyclical trends. It also has a huge exposure to international markets, which creates problems when foreign currency headwinds are strong. The stock has lost 57% in value year to date. However, analysts believe the company could perform well when inflation begins to decline worldwide.As of the end of the second quarter, 32 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK). The total value of these stakes was about $497 million. This is compared to 38 funds in the previous quarter which had $922 million worth of stakes.

China accounts for much of its production, and their zero-tolerance approach to pandemic safety measures has led to disruption, compounded by shipping difficulties and rising materials expenses. We still believe one outcome of the pandemic will be a buoyant home improvement market, given that one never knows when the next pandemic lockdown may occur.”6.

66,af91c3b5-027c-3152-809d-819dacc7ca8d,SBUX,2022-11-10,Alibaba (BABA) vs. Starbucks (SBUX): Which Stock is Better if China Reopens,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-baba-vs-starbucks-sbux-010201484.html,1668042121,STORY,"['9988.HK', 'SBUX', 'BABA']","[With more countries across Asia reopening, China is expected to reopen as well for international business and travel at some point in the near future. Although the country has not committed to reopening it is thought to be months away from doing so.News of such caused a rally in Chinese stocks last week. Investors may be considering these equities among other companies that add exposure to China’s huge economy to their portfolio.Let’s take a look at two stocks investors may be considering as the world’s second-largest economy is expected to eventually loosen its Zero-Covid policy.Alibaba BABAAlibaba is one of the most recognizable companies in the world with sales of $133.27 billion last year.BABA still trades 60% below its 52-week highs after the recent rally among Chinese equities. The rally boosted the stock from its recent low of $58.01 per share in October. However, BABA is still down -45% YTD to underperform the S&amp;P 500’s -21%. This is on par with its peer group’s -42%. The last few years have been very tumultuous for the stock as a large part of BABA’s decline hinged on fears of Chinese stocks being delisted on U.S. stock exchanges and the Chinese government cracking down on its big tech firms.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnfortunately for BABA, earnings estimate revisions have also started to decline again. And Alibaba’s core e-commerce business and online retail businesses won’t necessarily be directly affected by a China reopening which is something investors may want to be mindful of. While BABA still trades more reasonably than its past with a P/E of 11.4X, fears of the Chinese government heavily regulating domestic tech companies are still concerning as well and may take its toll on the company’s future earnings power.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchYear over year, BABA’s earnings are now expected to be down -11% in fiscal 2023 but rise 7% in FY24 at $7.90 a share, which is down from $8.33 per share 90 days ago. Sales are now expected to be virtually flat this year and rise 11% in fiscal 2024 to $148.21 billion.Story continuesBABA currently lands a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in correlation with earnings estimate revisions recently trending down for the current quarter, fiscal 2023, and FY24. While the stock may see a short-term boost from China reopening it won’t necessarily see the direct effects of increased consumer travel and spending from foreigners.Starbucks SBUX Starbucks (SBUX) is a viable option that investors may want to consider as the company has considerable exposure to China, operating over 6,000 stores in the country. The U.S and China combined account for 61% of the company’s global portfolio.China’s zero covid policy continues to take a toll on Starbucks’ revenue. During Starbucks recent fiscal Q4 earnings report earlier this month, the company’s International revenue declined 7% from Q4 2021 to $1.8 billion, primarily attributable to Covid-19 related restrictions in China. Operating income for its International segment was also down 42% at $217.6 million compared to $377.4 million in Q4 2021.Overall, China revenue was down -20% during the quarter at $775 million compared to $964 million in Q4 2021.With SBUX stock down 22% from its highs, the reopening of travel to China and locals being able to live their lives more freely without the scrutiny of Zero-Covid could give Starbucks a nice boost now and be very beneficial long term. The company is directly affected by consumer spending and declining store sales as its locations remain popular with Americans and other foreign visitors to China.SBUX’s -21% YTD performance is near the broader market’s decline. Over the last five years and prior to the pandemic, we can see SBUX is up +61%, which should be noted is considerably better than BABA’s -65% decline and also outperformed the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSBUX also trades reasonably relative to its past with a forward P/E of 27.5X. This is slightly above the industry average of 23.7X but well below its decade-high of 97.6X and near the median of 28.8X. Also, it is quite plausible that a China reopening could lead to immediate growth for SBUX.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchYear over year, earnings are now expected to be up 15% in fiscal 2023 and rise another 17% in FY24 at $3.99 per share, which is up from $3.96 at the beginning of the quarter. Top line growth is expected, with sales expected to be up 11% in fiscal 2023 and rise another 11% in FY24 to $39.93 billion.SBUX currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). EPS estimate revisions have slightly trended down for the current quarter and fiscal 2023, but are going up for FY24. Earnings estimate revisions could continue to improve if China reopens. SBUX also offers patient investors a solid 2.11% annual dividend yield at $1.96 per share.Bottom LineThe expectation that China will ease its Zero-Covid policy could certainly be a short-term catalyst for Chinese big tech companies like Alibaba, Baidu BIDU, and more. However, increased travel and consumer spending from foreigners won’t necessarily have a direct effect on their businesses.Starbucks on the other hand is a very viable investment for a reopened China as the company continues to grow its operations in the country and will remain popular among Americans and other foreign visitors. This may also help eliminate some of the risks associated with the regulations of Chinese companies, but still add the valuable foreign exposure China offers.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, HF Sinclair Corp, DINO, LPL Financial Holdings Inc. LPLA, Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC and Halliburton Co. HAL.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Must-Buy High-Flying Stocks of 2022Wall Street has experienced a disappointing 2022 so far. U.S. stock markets saw astonishing growth in the coronavirus-ridden last two years owing to unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli and ultra-dovish monetary policies adopted by the Fed.However, the complete devastation of the global supply-chain system, the shortage of labor, the lingering war between Russia and Ukraine and a zero-tolerance approach to COVD-19 infection taken by China resulted in global inflation, especially record-high inflation in the United States.Global financial markets have been rattled by the Fed’s highly aggressive monetary stance to combat 40-year high inflation. The interest rate has already jumped 3.75% this year with more hikes underway. Yields on U.S. sovereign bonds have skyrocketed and the dollar price index reached a two-decade high.Consequently, year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have plummeted 8.7%, 19.7% and 32.1%, respectively. Despite these severe headwinds several large-cap stocks are flying high in 2022. Investment in these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should provide solid returns in the near term.A Relief RallyU.S. stock markets have been witnessing an impressive rally since the beginning of October. We are not out of the woods as inflation remains elevated. In the post-FOMC meeting statement in November, the Fed Chairman clearly indicated that the terminal interest rate this rate-hiking cycle would be higher than 5%.Story continuesYet, markets continue to rally on the assumption that the Fed may lower the magnitude of rate hike from the December FOMC meeting. A series of recently released economic data has also suggested that the central bank’s ultra-hawkish monetary policies have started giving the needed results, albeit at a slow pace.The U.S. stock market momentum is likely to continue in November as the country’s GDP grew 2.6% in the third quarter, beating the consensus estimate of 2.2%. Market participants were worried that the economy might enter a recession after it contracted in the first two quarters of this year.In third-quarter 2022, the chain-weighted price index — a cost-of-living index adjusted for consumer behavior — rose 4.1%, well below the consensus estimate of a 5.3%. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index increased 4.2%, exhibiting a sharp fall from 7.3% in the second quarter. The core (excluding the volatile food and energy items) PCE price index — Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — rose 4.5% in the third quarter, in line with the market’s expectation.Out Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) stocks that have popped year to date with solid upside left for the rest of 2022. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days indicating that the market is expecting these companies to do good business in the near term. Each of our picks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. has been gaining from solid demand, improved productivity and product innovations. Persistent growth in the Nutrition segment of ADM, aided by significant gains in the Human and Animal Nutrition units, remains the key growth driver.Archer-Daniels-Midland expects the nutrition segment to record operating profit growth of 20% in 2022. The company has been significantly progressing on its three strategic pillars — optimize, drive and growth.Archer-Daniels-Midland has an expected earnings growth rate of 42.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.6% over the last seven days. The stock price of ADM has appreciated 42.6% year to date.HF Sinclair Corp, operates as an independent energy company. DINO produces and markets gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, renewable diesel, specialty lubricant products, specialty chemicals, specialty and modified asphalt, and others.HF Sinclair also owns and operates refineries located in Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. DINO markets its refined products principally in the Southwest United States and the Rocky Mountains, Pacific Northwest, and other neighboring Plains states.HF Sinclair has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year.

The stock price of DINO has soared 91.1% year to date.LPL Financial Holdings Inc. has been benefiting from strategic acquisitions, including the buyout of Waddell &amp; Reed's wealth management business. Solid advisor productivity and recruiting efforts are expected to keep aiding the advisory revenues of LPLA. Moreover, LPL Financial's efficient capital deployment activities reflect a solid balance sheet position.LPL Financial has an expected earnings growth rate of 61.3% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.8% over the last 30 days. The stock price of LPLA has surged 68.1% year to date.Marathon Petroleum Corp. is poised for further price gains based on a slew of positives. MPC’s $21 billion sales of its Speedway retail business provided it with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement under which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.MPC’s exposure to more stable cash flows from the logistics segment diversifies the earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon Petroleum is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed as a preferred downstream operator to own now.Marathon Petroleum has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.9% over the last seven days. The stock price of MPC has jumped 86.1% year to date.Halliburton Co. provides products and services to the energy industry worldwide. High commodity prices have increased demand for HAL’s services in North America, to which it is heavily exposed.In particular, Halliburton’s key Completion &amp; Production unit margins are likely to improve, with management expecting better pricing leverage going forward. Besides, Halliburton's strong free cash flow generating ability indicates its financial strength.HAL’s healthy relationship with national oil companies and digitization efforts also bode well. The increasing cloud-based data flow between sites and back office translates into expanded margins for Halliburton.Halliburton has an expected earnings growth rate of 92.6% for the current year.

71,94e7014b-69f3-35af-a1da-d25153cc0e89,ADM,2022-11-10,Should You Buy Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) For Its Upcoming Dividend?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-archer-daniels-midland-company-101325031.html,1668075205,STORY,['ADM'],"[Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Archer-Daniels-Midland investors that purchase the stock on or after the 15th of November will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 7th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.40 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.60 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Archer-Daniels-Midland has a trailing yield of 1.7% on the current stock price of $93.06. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Archer-Daniels-Midland's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Archer-Daniels-Midland is paying out just 22% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It distributed 32% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's positive to see that Archer-Daniels-Midland's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see Archer-Daniels-Midland has grown its earnings rapidly, up 28% a year for the past five years. Archer-Daniels-Midland is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Archer-Daniels-Midland has increased its dividend at approximately 8.6% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Archer-Daniels-Midland? We love that Archer-Daniels-Midland is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about Archer-Daniels-Midland, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Archer-Daniels-Midland is facing.

72,7246bbd5-1990-3aad-82f5-4fe806f3d1b8,ADM,2022-11-10,13 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks to Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-best-consumer-staples-dividend-162141293.html,1668010901,STORY,['ADM'],"[In this article, we will discuss 13 best consumer staples dividend stocks to buy now. You can skip our detailed analysis of the sector and its performance this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. The sizzling inflation and continuous interest rate hikes have taken nearly every sector into its fold this year. However, the consumer staples sector is performing better than the rest of the market because these companies exhibit strong demand for their products even during weak economic conditions. The growing demand gives the sector hedging capabilities against inflation, which makes investors pick these stocks over other risky industries. Some of the well-known names in the consumer staples sector include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP).Consumer staples companies benefitted a lot during the pandemic due to increased consumer spending, especially through digital channels. According to a report by JPMorgan, e-commerce represented 12% of gross sales in the first six months of 2020 and showed a 60% growth from the prior-year period (see the biggest e-commerce companies). The shift in the companies’ way of running businesses has further expanded the sector as people now have access to various online systems. This year’s returns have also shown that shares of the consumer staple companies have trounced their counterparts. The S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples index declined by 6.22% year-to-date, compared with a 29.6% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology index. Another report by Fidelity Investments shows that the consumer staples sector delivered a 14% annualized return in the last three years ending March 2022, compared with an 11% and 13.2% return for the energy and industrial sectors.Due to their non-cyclic nature, consumer staples have stable earnings, consistent cash flows, and strong balance sheets, which are very important from a dividend perspective. In the current market, investors prefer safe stocks that would help them to stay afloat and generate stable income. For this reason, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks in the sector.Story continues13 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks to Buy NowCopyright: jetcityimage / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are from the consumer staples sector and pay dividends to shareholders. We analyzed these stocks through their dividend policies, balance sheets, and overall fundamentals. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yields as of November 8.13. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Dividend Yield as of November 8: 0.73%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American multinational big-box store company. In October, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $525 with an Overweight rating on the shares, appreciating the company's unit growth and market share gains.In fiscal Q4 2022, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) reported revenue of $72 billion, which showed a 15% growth from the same period last year. The company ended the quarter with over $10.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Its total current assets amounted to over $32.6 billion, compared with $29.5 billion in the prior-year quarter.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 18 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks in the consumer staples sector. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share for a dividend yield of 0.73%, as of November 8.At the end of Q2 2022, 64 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), up from 61 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $4.76 billion. With stakes over $2 billion, Fisher Asset Management owned the largest position in the company in Q2.In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), investors are also paying attention to Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) due to its strong dividend policy.Cooper Investors mentioned Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”12. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Dividend Yield as of November 8: 1.56%Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail company that operates a chain of hypermarkets and grocery stores.

(NYSE:WMT) in October to $165 with a Buy rating on the shares, calling the company a value leader in retail.

(NYSE:WMT) was a popular buy among elite funds in Q2 2022, as 67 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned positions in it, up from 60 a quarter earlier. The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a total value of over $3.78 billion.Leaven Partners mentioned Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”11. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM)Dividend Yield as of November 8: 1.66%Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is an Illinois-based multinational food processing and commodities trading company.

The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a consolidated value of nearly $659 million.Diamond Hill Capital mentioned Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“ADM is a leading agricultural processor that also operates a global nutrition business focused on the development of ingredients and flavors for food and beverages, supplements and more. The company’s recent operating results have benefited (unfortunately) from the war in Ukraine as grain prices and agricultural markets globally experienced strong price increases. ADM is positioned well to benefit from the volatility due to its stable North American agricultural base.”10.

Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Dividend Yield as of November 8: 2.52%Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is a New York-based multinational consumer products company that specializes in healthcare, personal care, and other household products.

The company paid $1.2 billion in dividends to shareholders during the quarter, up from $1.1 billion paid during the same period last year.On September 9, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share, in line with its previous dividend. The company holds a 60-year streak of consistent dividend payments, which places it as one of the best dividend stocks on our list. Moreover, it has raised its payouts at a CAGR of 3.09% in the last five years.

These stakes have a total value of nearly $3 billion.Third Point mentioned Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its recently-published Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)7.

EL asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Lenovo Group Ltd. LNVGY, HP Inc. HPQ and Dell Technologies Inc. DELL.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:The Zacks Consumer Staples sector has fared better than most in 2022, down roughly 7% and widely outperforming the general market.Companies in the sector have the advantageous ability to generate revenue in the face of many economic situations, helping explain why it’s been a brighter spot in an otherwise dim market.A widely-recognized company residing in the realm, Archer Daniels Midland, has seen its near-term earnings outlook turn visibly bright over the last several months, helping to land the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Archer Daniels Midland is a leading producer of food and beverage ingredients and goods made from various agricultural products.Let’s take a deeper dive into how the company currently stacks up.Share Performance Year-to-date, ADM shares have been visibly strong, tacking on more than 40% in value and leaving the S&amp;P 500 in the dust.Over the last month, shares have continued on their market-beating trajectory, up a double-digit 11% and again outperforming the S&amp;P 500.The strong price action of ADM shares in 2022 indicates that buyers have been present all year long, something we can’t say for the majority of stocks in 2022.ValuationShares are reasonably priced, further bolstered by its Style Score of an A for Value.ADM shares trade at a 12.9X forward earnings multiple, nicely beneath the 14.2X five-year median and reflecting a 35% discount relative to its Zacks sector average.Quarterly PerformanceADM has been on an impressive earnings streak, exceeding both revenue and earnings estimates in eight consecutive quarters.Story continuesJust in its latest print, Archer Daniels Midland penciled in a sizable 31% bottom-line beat paired with a 7.8% sales surprise.DividendsInvestors love dividends. After all, who doesn’t enjoy getting paid?ADM’s annual dividend yield currently sits at 1.7%, lower than that of its Zacks sector. Still, the company’s 4.1% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps to pick up the slack in a big way.Further, ADM has a sustainable payout ratio of 22% of its earnings.Bottom LineOne of the best ways investors can find expected winners is by utilizing the Zacks Rank – one of the most potent market tools out there that gives investors a massive advantage.The top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.Archer Daniels Midland would be an excellent stock for investors to keep on their watchlists, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Bear of the Day:The Zacks Consumer Staples sector has fared better than most in 2022, down roughly 7% and widely outperforming the general market.However, one company in the realm that’s been a slight exception is The Estee Lauder Companies, Inc.The Estee Lauder Companies is one of the world's leading manufacturers and marketers of skincare, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products. The company's products are sold through department stores, mass retailers, company-owned retail stores, hair salons, and travel-related establishments.Analysts have been bearish regarding EL’s near-term earnings outlook, pushing it into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Let’s take a deeper dive into the company.Share PerformanceIt’s been a challenging road for EL shares in 2022, down more than 40% and widely underperforming the general market.And over the last three months, shares have continued on their downward trajectory, down more than 20% and again underperforming the general market.The adverse price action of EL shares tells us that sellers have remained in control, something we’ve seen with many stocks in a historically-volatile 2022.ValuationThe company’s forward earnings multiple sits at 38.4X, on the higher end of the spectrum and perhaps steering away value-focused investors.Further, the current value is above its five-year median of 34.1X and reflects a 92% premium relative to its Zacks sector average of 19.9X.The company carries a Value Style Score of an F.Quarterly Performance Still, the company carries a strong earnings track record, surpassing the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in nine consecutive quarters. Just in its latest print, EL registered a 6.2% bottom-line beat.Revenue results have also been strong, with EL penciling in seven top-line beats across its last ten quarters.Bottom LineNegative earnings estimate revisions and steep valuation multiples paint a less-than-ideal picture for the company in the short term.The Estee Lauder Companies is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), telling us it has a weak near-term earnings outlook.Investors should pivot to stocks that either carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks have a much stronger earnings outlook and potential to deliver explosive gains in the short term.Additional content:Can the PC Market Bounce Back from Its Recent Lows?Global PC sales, which surged at the height of the pandemic, have once again started declining. Sales of PCs, which include laptops and tablets, saw an unexpected jump during the peak of the pandemic as millions worked remotely. However, demand appears to be declining once again as things return to normal and people go back to their workplaces and schools.However, there are several other factors that are posing challenges for the PC market, the supply chain crisis being one of the biggest. It must overcome a number of obstacles, including a supply-chain problem. The industry thus needs to overcome these challenges to bounce back from the present situation.Global PC Shipment Hit New LowSeveral industries were left battered by the COVID-19 outbreak but some also managed to be big beneficiaries of the pandemic. One of them that benefited the most was the PC sector. However, things have once more shifted, and this year's sales are in free fall.According to a report from Gartner, global PC shipments totaled 68 million units in the third quarter of 2022, a 19.5% decline year over year. This is the sharpest drop in nine years and the second straight quarter of double-digit decline. PC shipments totaled 72 million in the second quarter, recording a decline of 12.6% year over year.PC sales started slowing last year once the economy started reopening. This year has particularly been worse given that sales have declined drastically in all the first three quarters of the year.The primary reason behind the decline in the third quarter was the lack of demand for PCs during the back-to-school season and shrinking enterprise purchasing.Challenges GaloreIndustry leaders have been suffering the most because of the decline in demand for PCs. The top three PC makers have likewise had the biggest loss throughout this time, despite the fact that their ranking has not changed.Lenovo Group Ltd., which is still the market leader, saw its market share increase in the third quarter of 2022 to 23.7%. However, on a year-over-year basis, LNGVY recorded a 16% decline in sales. This is also the fourth straight quarter of sales decline for Lenovo Group Limited.HP Inc. held its position as the second largest in terms of market share. HP now holds 18% of the market share but it managed to sell only 12.7 million units. This is also the second consecutive quarter when HP had less than 20% market share. Moreover, HP recorded a 26.5% year-over-year decline in sales in the third quarter.Dell Technologies Inc., the third largest player, saw its shipments plummet more than 20% in third-quarter 2022, after declining 5.2% in the previous quarter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The United States, one of the biggest markets, has seen a steep decline in PC sales in 2022. The U.S. PC market plummeted 17.3% in the third quarter, recording five straight quarters of declines. Slowing laptop sales is affecting the overall PC market in the United States, although demand for desktops showed modest improvement.The PC industry is facing several challenges. Inflation has been a major concern in the United States, which has seen people cutting down on expensive goods. The third quarter saw the supply-chain crisis finally easing but high inventory is now a fresh concern as demand continues to shrink in both the consumer and business markets.Lower demand for PC is also impacting semiconductor sales now. Several chipmakers have said that weaker demand for PCs is impacting its revenues.Overall, 2022 has been fairly challenging for the PC market and experts believe that the market will not improve before 2023. Given the ongoing challenges and weak demand, 2022 is likely to see a 13% year-over-year fall in global PC shipments, according to Gartner. The firm had earlier predicted a 9.5% year-over-year decline in salesWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

74,6b2cf1c5-a27c-33a2-83b7-b5003ede4b5b,ADM,2022-11-10,Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Archer Daniels Midland Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-archer-133001469.html,1668000601,STORY,['ADM'],"[For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ADM for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Archer Daniels Midland's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Archer Daniels Midland's main business drivers.Incorporated in Delaware in 1923, Archer Daniels Midland Company is successor to the Daniels Linseed Co. Founded in 1902, this Illinois-based company is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products.The company processes oilseeds, corn, wheat, cocoa and other feedstuffs. Moreover, it engages in the manufacturing, sale, and distribution of products like natural flavor ingredients, flavor systems, natural colors, proteins, emulsifiers, soluble fiber, polyols, hydrocolloids, natural health and nutrition products as well as other specialty food and feed ingredients.Archer Daniels also has a worldwide grain elevator and transportation network for procurement, storage, cleansing and transportation of agricultural commodities. Archer Daniels also makes important investments in joint ventures to aid growth.Starting first-quarter 2018, the company realigned its business segments to reflect a new operating structure. It currently reports through the Carbohydrate Solutions, Nutrition, Oilseeds and Origination segments.On May 29, 2019, Archer Daniels created a new business unit, namely, Ag Services &amp; Oilseeds. The unit combined the company’s Origination and Oilseed operations in a single reporting structure which came into operations from Jul 1, 2019.The Ag Services &amp; Oilseeds (78.6% of 2021 total revenues) includes the Agricultural Services business, excluding Milling and engages in originating, merchandising, crushing and processing oilseeds.The Carbohydrate Solutions segment (13%) comprises the Corn and Milling operations.Nutrition segment (7.9%) includes Animal Nutrition and Bioactives businesses as well as the Wild Flavors &amp; Specialty Ingredients segment (WFSI).The Other segment (0.4%) primarily includes the company’s financial business units. However, it makes negligible contribution to the company’s revenues.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Archer Daniels Midland ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in November 2012 would be worth $3,784.45, or a gain of 278.45%, as of November 9, 2022, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.The S&amp;P 500 rose 177.90% and the price of gold increased -4.99% over the same time frame in comparison.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for ADM.Shares of Archer Daniels have outpaced the industry in a year's time on robust earnings surprise trend, which continued in third-quarter 2022. Both top and bottom lines beat estimates and grew year over year. This marked the 13th straight quarter of an earnings surprise and the 12th straight quarter of adjusted operating profit growth. Results were bolstered by robust global demand, gains from the integrated global value chain and a solid product portfolio. Persistent growth in the Nutrition segment remained a key growth driver. It expects the nutrition segment operating profit growth of 15-20% in 2022. The fourth-quarter performance is likely to be higher year over year, driven by the continued demand in the Human Nutrition unit. However, rising SG&amp;A costs act as a deterrent. Higher inflation also remain concerning.The stock is up 11.69% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 7 higher, for fiscal 2022. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

75,e5cdd298-b923-3f8d-a579-e10ad27c5bb8,ADM,2022-11-10,5 Must-Buy High-Flying Stocks of 2022 With More Upside Left,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-must-buy-high-flying-130301010.html,1667998981,STORY,['ADM'],"[Wall Street has experienced a disappointing 2022 so far. U.S. stock markets saw astonishing growth in the coronavirus-ridden last two years owing to unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli and ultra-dovish monetary policies adopted by the Fed.However, the complete devastation of the global supply-chain system, the shortage of labor, the lingering war between Russia and Ukraine and a zero-tolerance approach to COVD-19 infection taken by China resulted in global inflation, especially record-high inflation in the United States.Global financial markets have been rattled by the Fed’s highly aggressive monetary stance to combat 40-year high inflation. The interest rate has already jumped 3.75% this year with more hikes underway. Yields on U.S. sovereign bonds have skyrocketed and the dollar price index reached a two-decade high.Consequently, year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have plummeted 8.7%, 19.7% and 32.1%, respectively. Despite these severe headwinds several large-cap stocks are flying high in 2022. Investment in these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should provide solid returns in the near term.A Relief RallyU.S. stock markets have been witnessing an impressive rally since the beginning of October. We are not out of the woods as inflation remains elevated. In the post-FOMC meeting statement in November, the Fed Chairman clearly indicated that the terminal interest rate this rate-hiking cycle would be higher than 5%.Yet, markets continue to rally on the assumption that the Fed may lower the magnitude of rate hike from the December FOMC meeting. A series of recently released economic data has also suggested that the central bank’s ultra-hawkish monetary policies have started giving the needed results, albeit at a slow pace.The U.S. stock market momentum is likely to continue in November as the country’s GDP grew 2.6% in the third quarter, beating the consensus estimate of 2.2%. Market participants were worried that the economy might enter a recession after it contracted in the first two quarters of this year.Story continuesIn third-quarter 2022, the chain-weighted price index — a cost-of-living index adjusted for consumer behavior — rose 4.1%, well below the consensus estimate of a 5.3%. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index increased 4.2%, exhibiting a sharp fall from 7.3% in the second quarter. The core (excluding the volatile food and energy items) PCE price index — Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — rose 4.5% in the third quarter, in line with the market’s expectation.Out Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) stocks that have popped year to date with solid upside left for the rest of 2022. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days indicating that the market is expecting these companies to do good business in the near term. Each of our picks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchArcher-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM has been gaining from solid demand, improved productivity and product innovations. Persistent growth in the Nutrition segment of ADM, aided by significant gains in the Human and Animal Nutrition units, remains the key growth driver.Archer-Daniels-Midland expects the nutrition segment to record operating profit growth of 20% in 2022. The company has been significantly progressing on its three strategic pillars — optimize, drive and growth.Archer-Daniels-Midland has an expected earnings growth rate of 42.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.6% over the last seven days. The stock price of ADM has appreciated 42.6% year to date.HF Sinclair Corp, DINO operates as an independent energy company.

LPLA has been benefiting from strategic acquisitions, including the buyout of Waddell &amp; Reed's wealth management business.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.8% over the last 30 days. The stock price of LPLA has surged 68.1% year to date.Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC is poised for further price gains based on a slew of positives. MPC’s $21 billion sales of its Speedway retail business provided it with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement under which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.MPC’s exposure to more stable cash flows from the logistics segment diversifies the earnings stream and offers a buffer against the volatile refining business. Consequently, Marathon Petroleum is primed for significant capital appreciation and is viewed as a preferred downstream operator to own now.Marathon Petroleum has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.9% over the last seven days. The stock price of MPC has jumped 86.1% year to date.Halliburton Co. HAL provides products and services to the energy industry worldwide. High commodity prices have increased demand for HAL’s services in North America, to which it is heavily exposed.In particular, Halliburton’s key Completion &amp; Production unit margins are likely to improve, with management expecting better pricing leverage going forward. Besides, Halliburton's strong free cash flow generating ability indicates its financial strength.HAL’s healthy relationship with national oil companies and digitization efforts also bode well. The increasing cloud-based data flow between sites and back office translates into expanded margins for Halliburton.Halliburton has an expected earnings growth rate of 92.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the last seven days.

This move was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 2.08%. At the same time, the Dow lost 1.95%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.17%.Heading into today, shares of the maker of software used to test and develop chips had gained 5.13% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.81% and lagging the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.29% in that time.Synopsys will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.84, up 1.1% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $1.28 billion, up 11.01% from the prior-year quarter.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Synopsys. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.09% lower. Synopsys currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Looking at its valuation, Synopsys is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 28.55.

Shareholders not resident in Sweden who wish to accept the Offer (as defined below) must make inquiries concerning applicable legislation and possible tax consequences. Shareholders should refer to the offer restrictions included in the section titled ""Important information"" at the end of this announcement and in the offer document, which has been published on the Offer website (www.smokefree-offer.com). Shareholders in the United States should also refer to the section entitled ""Special notice to shareholders in the United States"" at the end of this announcement.On May 11, 2022, Philip Morris Holland Holdings B.V.1 (""PMHH""), an affiliate of Philip Morris International Inc. (""PMI""), announced a recommended public offer to the shareholders of Swedish Match AB (""Swedish Match"") to tender all shares in Swedish Match2 to PMHH (the ""Offer""). On November 7, 2022, PMHH declared the Offer unconditional and announced that it would complete the Offer and acquire all shares in Swedish Match that have been tendered in the Offer. In addition, PMHH extended the acceptance period until November 25, 2022 and informed the Swedish Match shareholders that the price in the Offer for shares tendered during the further extended acceptance period will be reduced to SEK 115.07 in cash per share due to the resolved dividend payment by Swedish Match of SEK 0.93 per share for shareholders of record as of November 14, 2022.The shares tendered in the Offer at the end of the acceptance period (which expired on November 4, 2022) amounted to in aggregate 1,255,989,816 shares in Swedish Match3, corresponding to approximately 82.59 percent4 of the share capital and the voting rights in Swedish Match. Settlement for shares tendered in the Offer up to and including November 4, 2022, is expected to be initiated around November 11, 2022.Story continuesAs set forth in the offer document regarding the Offer made public on June 28, 2022 (the ""Offer Document""), PMHH and its affiliates may, to the extent permissible under applicable law or regulations, acquire, or take measures to acquire, shares in Swedish Match in other ways than through the Offer. Information about such acquisitions of shares, or measures to acquire shares, must be disclosed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.A shareholding exceeding 85 percent5 of the share capital and the voting rights in Swedish Match impacts the inclusion of Swedish Match shares in various market indexes, and is therefore information relevant for certain index funds holding shares in Swedish Match. In view of this, PMHH wishes to inform the Swedish Match shareholders that PMHH has acquired 49,899,948 shares in Swedish Match outside of the Offer since the announcement of the outcome of the Offer on November 7, 2022. Accordingly, the total number of shares in Swedish Match acquired by PMHH, including the shares tendered in the Offer at the end of the acceptance period on November 4, 2022, amounts to 1,305,889,764 shares, corresponding to approximately 85.87 percent5 of the share capital and the voting rights in Swedish Match. No acquisitions have been made at a price exceeding the price in the Offer.""We are pleased to have already reached almost 86% ownership of Swedish Match within the first 3 business days of the extension period,"" said Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer of PMI. ""We encourage the remaining shareholders to tender as soon as possible in the extended time to avoid having to wait for payment through a potential minority redemption process, which we intend to initiate after reaching an ownership of more than 90%.""""We look forward to welcoming Swedish Match’s employees and leading oral nicotine portfolio into the PMI family to create a global smoke-free champion, notably bringing IQOS and ZYN together in both the U.S. and international markets. We will be working together to create value as we accelerate towards our shared vision of a smoke-free future.""PMHH will continue to strive towards an ownership in Swedish Match of more than 90 percent5 of the total number of shares in Swedish Match and thereafter initiate compulsory redemption of the remaining shares in Swedish Match under the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)), as well as promote a delisting of Swedish Match’s shares from Nasdaq Stockholm. For further information on the implications of PMHH’s ownership of less than 90 percent of the total number of registered shares in Swedish Match, PMHH refers shareholders of Swedish Match to the description thereof included in the section of the Offer Document entitled ""Important notice to shareholders in the United States of America"".As previously announced, PMHH has extended the acceptance period until November 25, 2022 at 17.00 (CET) to provide the remaining shareholders of Swedish Match who have not tendered their shares time to accept the Offer. Due to the resolved dividend payment by Swedish Match of SEK 0.93 per share with record date for the payment on November 14, 2022, and expected date for payment through Euroclear Sweden on November 17, 2022, the price in the Offer for shares tendered during the further extended acceptance period will, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer6, be reduced accordingly to SEK 115.07 in cash per share. For further information regarding Swedish Match’s resolution on dividends at the annual general meeting 2022, please refer to Swedish Match’s website, www.swedishmatch.com.

Each shareholder is urged to consult an independent professional adviser regarding the tax consequences of accepting the Offer. Neither PMHH nor any of its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, or agents or any other person acting on their behalf in connection with the Offer shall be responsible for any tax effects or liabilities resulting from acceptance of this Offer.NEITHER THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY U.S. STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED THE OFFER, MADE ANY COMMENT UPON THE MERITS OR FAIRNESS OF THE OFFER, MADE ANY COMMENT UPON THE ADEQUACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THIS PRESS RELEASE, OR MADE ANY COMMENT ON WHETHER THE CONTENT OF THIS PRESS RELEASE IS CORRECT OR COMPLETE.

The quarterly results were hurt by lower revenues and transactions in the Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) segment, which usually contributes a massive chunk to WU’s overall revenues.The segment was affected by discontinuation of operations across Russia and Belarus. Nevertheless, the downside was partly offset by a lower expense level and double-digit growth in U.S. outbound new digital customer acquisition.The Western Union Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe Western Union Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe Western Union Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Western Union Company QuoteQ3 ResultsWestern Union reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 42 cents, matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line plunged 33.3% year over year due to lower operating profit.Total revenues fell 15% year over year on a reported basis or 6% on a constant currency basis to $1,089.6 million. Also, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a whisker.Adjusted operating margin of 20.6% deteriorated 460 basis points year over year due to lower revenues, and technology and market-linked investments.Western Union’s total expenses came in at $857.8 million, down 11% year over year. Lower cost of services, and selling, general and administrative expenses contributed to this decline in overall expenses in the third quarter.C2C SegmentThe C2C segment reported revenues of $982.4 million, which tumbled 11% year over year on a reported basis or 8% on a constant currency basis in the quarter under review. The segment’s revenue, however, fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,001 million.Transactions within the C2C segment fell 12% year over year due to lower transactions across Europe and CIS, North America, East Asia and Oceania (APAC) and the Middle East, Africa and South Asia (MEASA).Digital money transfer revenues dropped 12% year over year on a reported basis or 9% on a constant currency basis in the third quarter. Digital money transfer transactions fell 20% year over year.Story continuesBranded Digital revenues decreased 8% on a reported basis or 5% on a constant currency basis.Balance Sheet (as of Sep 30, 2022)Western Union exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,176.1 million, slipping 2.7% from the 2021-end level.

The midpoint of the guidance indicates a 17.8% decline from the 2021 reported figure.Operating profit margin is expected between 20% and 21%. The metric stood at 22.5% in 2021.Update on Business Solutions Sell-OffLast year, Western Union had inked a deal with Goldfinch Partners LLC and The Baupost Group LLC to divest its Business Solutions unit in two stages. The first closing took place on Mar 1, 2022.However, in the third quarter, with the mutual consent of all the parties to the divestiture agreement, a decision was taken to divest Business Solutions in three stages. The second closing related to the sale of the United Kingdom operations is expected in December 2022. In the third stage, the European Union operations included within the Business Solutions unit, is expected to be divested in the first quarter of 2023. Needless to say, both closings are required to fulfill the pending regulatory approvals.Zacks RankWestern Union currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

81,d3ea0368-ae86-3568-9bd1-a5a41c5467d7,TDG,2022-11-10,Is TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) Potentially Undervalued?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/transdigm-group-incorporated-nyse-tdg-131349115.html,1668086029,STORY,['TDG'],"[TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on TransDigm Group’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for TransDigm Group What's The Opportunity In TransDigm Group?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 19% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy TransDigm Group today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $717.65, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since TransDigm Group’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of TransDigm Group look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for TransDigm Group. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? TDG’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on TDG, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing TransDigm Group at this point in time.

Organic sales growth as a percentage of net sales was 16.4%.Income from continuing operations for the quarter increased $57 million, or 27.3%, to $266 million from $209 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. The increase in income from continuing operations primarily reflects the increase in net sales described above and favorable sales mix. The increase was partially offset by higher non-cash stock and deferred compensation expense and higher general and administrative expenses primarily related to increased costs for labor, travel and other sales support in the ongoing inflationary environment.Story continuesGAAP earnings per share were reduced in the quarter by $0.70 per share as a result of dividend equivalent payments made in the fourth quarter related to the $18.50 per share dividend declared and paid in the quarter. No dividend equivalent payments were made during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.Adjusted net income for the quarter increased 26.2% to $313 million, or $5.50 per share, from $248 million, or $4.25 per share, in the comparable quarter a year ago.EBITDA for the quarter increased 14.8% to $704 million from $613 million for the comparable quarter a year ago. EBITDA As Defined for the quarter increased 18.2% to $752 million compared with $636 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 49.8% compared with 49.7% in the comparable quarter a year ago.Year-to-Date ResultsFiscal 2022 net sales increased 13.2%, or $631 million, to $5,429 million from $4,798 million in fiscal 2021. Organic sales growth as a percentage of net sales was 14.4%.Fiscal 2022 income from continuing operations increased $185 million, or 27.2%, to $866 million from $681 million in fiscal 2021. The increase in income from continuing operations primarily reflects the increase in net sales described above and favorable sales mix, along with lower COVID-19 restructuring costs and lower one-time refinancing costs, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and higher non-cash stock and deferred compensation expense. The prior year also included the benefit of the net gain on sale recognized as a result of the divestitures completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2021.GAAP earnings per share were reduced in fiscal 2022 and 2021 by $1.47 per share and $1.24 per share, respectively, as a result of dividend equivalent payments made during each year. As a reminder, GAAP earnings per share are reduced when TransDigm makes dividend equivalent payments pursuant to the Company's stock option plans. These dividend equivalent payments are made during the Company's first fiscal quarter each year and also upon payment of any special dividends.Fiscal 2022 adjusted net income increased 41.0% to $998 million, or $17.14 per share, from $708 million, or $12.13 per share, in fiscal 2021.Fiscal 2022 EBITDA increased 21.2% to $2,456 million from $2,027 million in fiscal 2021. EBITDA As Defined for fiscal 2022 increased 20.9% to $2,646 million compared with $2,189 million in fiscal 2021. EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2022 was 48.7% compared with 45.6% in fiscal 2021.During fiscal 2022, TransDigm repurchased 1,490,413 shares of its common stock with a weighted-average price per share of $612.13 at an aggregate cost of approximately $912 million. As previously reported, on January 27, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a new $2,200 million stock repurchase program to replace the existing program permitting the repurchase of a portion of TransDigm's outstanding shares. As of September 30, 2022, the remaining amount of repurchases allowed under the new program was approximately $1,288 million.""I am very pleased with our team's performance and the overall operating results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022,"" stated Kevin Stein, TransDigm Group's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Although fiscal 2022 continued to be impacted by the disruption in the commercial aerospace industry caused by the pandemic, the recovery of the industry made significant progress as passenger demand trended upward and OEMs began to ramp aircraft production rates. While domestic travel continues to lead the air traffic recovery, international air traffic has also now rebounded significantly, as the majority of countries have relaxed entry requirements and fully re-opened to travelers. We remain encouraged by these positive signs as we go forward.During fiscal 2022, we remained sharply focused on our value drivers and cost structure. This strict operational focus together with the continued recovery of our commercial aftermarket revenues drove a strong fiscal 2022 EBITDA As Defined margin of 48.7%, which was up over three margin points from the prior year.We are pleased to have deployed approximately $2.4 billion of capital in fiscal 2022 across the DART acquisition, a special dividend, and share repurchases. Subsequent to these capital allocation activities, we closed out fiscal 2022 with approximately $3.0 billion of cash, which leaves us with significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities. We look forward to fiscal 2023 and the opportunity to continue creating value for our shareholders.""Please see the attached tables for a reconciliation of income from continuing operations to EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, and adjusted net income; a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined, and a reconciliation of earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share for the periods discussed in this press release.Fiscal 2023 OutlookTransDigm previously suspended financial guidance in April of 2020 as a result of the significant disruption in our primary commercial end markets related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the Company's primary commercial end markets have now stabilized and returned to growth, TransDigm is re-initiating guidance and providing expectations for the full fiscal year 2023. As fiscal 2023 progresses, the Company will continue to monitor the ongoing uncertainty across the broader global economy and within the commercial aerospace market as this sector continues to recover, which could lead to revisions in our guidance for fiscal 2023.TransDigm expects fiscal 2023 financial guidance to be as follows:Net sales are anticipated to be in the range of $5,990 million to $6,190 million compared with $5,429 million in fiscal 2022;Net income from continuing operations is anticipated to be in the range of $1,036 million to $1,116 million compared with $866 million in fiscal 2022;Earnings per share from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $17.45 to $18.85 per share based upon weighted average shares outstanding of 57.1 million shares compared with $13.38 per share in fiscal 2022;EBITDA As Defined is anticipated to be in the range of $2,995 million to $3,095 million compared with $2,646 million in fiscal 2022 (corresponding to an EBITDA As Defined margin guide of approximately 50% for fiscal 2023);Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $20.68 to $22.08 per share compared with $17.14 per share in fiscal 2022; andFiscal 2023 outlook is based on the following market growth assumptions:Please see the attached Table 6 for a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined to net income and reported earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share guidance mid-point estimated for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023.Earnings Conference CallTransDigm Group will host a conference call for investors and security analysts on November 10, 2022, beginning at 11:00 a.m., Eastern Time.

Major product offerings, substantially all of which are ultimately provided to end-users in the aerospace industry, include mechanical/electro-mechanical actuators and controls, ignition systems and engine technology, specialized pumps and valves, power conditioning devices, specialized AC/DC electric motors and generators, batteries and chargers, engineered latching and locking devices, engineered rods, engineered connectors and elastomer sealing solutions, databus and power controls, cockpit security components and systems, specialized and advanced cockpit displays, engineered audio, radio and antenna systems, specialized lavatory components, seat belts and safety restraints, engineered and customized interior surfaces and related components, advanced sensor products, switches and relay panels, thermal protection and insulation, lighting and control technology, parachutes, high performance hoists, winches and lifting devices, and cargo loading, handling and delivery systems.Non-GAAP Supplemental InformationEBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, EBITDA As Defined Margin, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release as supplemental disclosures to net income and reported results. TransDigm Group defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and defines EBITDA As Defined as EBITDA plus certain non-operating items recorded as corporate expenses, including non-cash compensation charges incurred in connection with TransDigm Group's stock incentive or deferred compensation plans, restructuring costs related to TransDigm Group's cost reduction measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition-integration costs, acquisition and divestiture transaction-related expenses, and refinancing costs. COVID-19 restructuring costs represented actions primarily taken by the Company in fiscal 2021 and 2020 to reduce its workforce to align with customer demand, as well as incremental costs related to the pandemic that are not expected to recur once the pandemic has subsided and are clearly separable from normal operations (e.g., additional cleaning and disinfecting of facilities by contractors above and beyond normal requirements, personal protective equipment). Acquisition and divestiture-related costs represent accounting adjustments to inventory associated with acquisitions of businesses and product lines that were charged to cost of sales when the inventory was sold; costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and product lines into the Company's operations, facility relocation costs and other acquisition-related costs; transaction-related costs for both acquisitions and divestitures comprising deal fees; legal, financial and tax diligence expenses and valuation costs that are required to be expensed as incurred and other acquisition accounting adjustments. TransDigm Group defines adjusted net income as net income plus purchase accounting backlog amortization expense, effects from the sale on businesses, non-cash compensation charges incurred in connection with TransDigm Group's stock incentive plans, restructuring costs related to TransDigm Group's cost reduction measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition-integration costs, acquisition transaction-related expenses, and refinancing costs. EBITDA As Defined Margin represents EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of net sales. TransDigm Group defines adjusted diluted earnings per share as adjusted net income divided by the total shares for basic and diluted earnings per share. For more information regarding the computation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined and adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, please see the attached financial tables.TransDigm Group presents these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that they are useful indicators of its operating performance. TransDigm Group believes that EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to measure operating performance among companies with different capital structures, effective tax rates and tax attributes, capitalized asset values and employee compensation structures, all of which can vary substantially from company to company. In addition, analysts, rating agencies and others use EBITDA to evaluate a company's ability to incur and service debt. EBITDA As Defined is used to measure TransDigm Inc.'s compliance with the financial covenant contained in its credit facility. TransDigm Group's management also uses EBITDA As Defined to review and assess its operating performance, to prepare its annual budget and financial projections and to review and evaluate its management team in connection with employee incentive programs. Moreover, TransDigm Group's management uses EBITDA As Defined to evaluate acquisitions and as a liquidity measure. In addition, TransDigm Group's management uses adjusted net income as a measure of comparable operating performance between time periods and among companies as it is reflective of changes in pricing decisions, cost controls and other factors that affect operating performance.None of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, EBITDA As Defined Margin, adjusted net income or adjusted earnings per share is a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and such financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities or other measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, TransDigm Group's calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Although we use EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined as measures to assess the performance of our business and for the other purposes set forth above, the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider any of them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness;although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects any cash requirements for such replacements;  the omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined;  neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined includes the payment of taxes, which is a necessary element of our operations; andEBITDA As Defined excludes the cash expense we have incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations, which is a necessary element of certain of our acquisitions.Forward-Looking StatementsStatements in this press release that are not historical facts, including statements under the heading ""Fiscal 2023 Outlook,"" are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

GSSC is managed by Goldman Sachs Funds. GSSC seeks to match the performance of the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index before fees and expenses.The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of small capitalization U.S. issuers.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesFor ETF investors, expense ratios are an important factor when considering a fund's return; in the long-term, cheaper funds actually have the ability to outperform their more expensive cousins if all other things remain the same.Story continuesOperating expenses on an annual basis are 0.20% for GSSC, making it on par with most peer products in the space.GSSC's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.37%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.GSSC's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 20.80% of the portfolio. Its Industrials and Information Technology round out the top three.When you look at individual holdings, Sep 22 Cme Eminirus2k (RTYU2) accounts for about 2.19% of the fund's total assets, followed by Usd U.s. Dollar and Sm Energy Co (SM).The top 10 holdings account for about 5.52% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskYear-to-date, the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF has lost about -18.40% so far, and is down about -21.30% over the last 12 months (as of 11/10/2022). GSSC has traded between $50.18 and $70.22 in this past 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 0.97 and standard deviation of 29.99% for the trailing three-year period. With about 1278 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Small Cap Blend segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) tracks Russell 2000 Index and the iShares Core S&amp;P SmallCap ETF (IJR) tracks S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Index. IShares Russell 2000 ETF has $50.18 billion in assets, iShares Core S&amp;P SmallCap ETF has $64.36 billion. IWM has an expense ratio of 0.19% and IJR charges 0.06%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Small Cap Blend.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So on that note, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Netflix, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.14 = US$5.7b ÷ (US$48b - US$7.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Netflix has an ROCE of 14%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Entertainment industry average of 5.3% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for Netflix roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Netflix compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Netflix here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?The trends we've noticed at Netflix are quite reassuring. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 14%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 241%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.In another part of our analysis, we noticed that the company's ratio of current liabilities to total assets decreased to 16%, which broadly means the business is relying less on its suppliers or short-term creditors to fund its operations. So shareholders would be pleased that the growth in returns has mostly come from underlying business performance.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Netflix's ROCETo sum it up, Netflix has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. Considering the stock has delivered 33% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.On the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation. That's why we have a FREE intrinsic value estimation on our platform  that is definitely worth checking out.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

With 74% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Phillips 66, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Phillips 66 ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Phillips 66?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Phillips 66 does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Phillips 66's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Phillips 66 is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.0% and 6.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Phillips 66The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Phillips 66 in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$103m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 26% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Phillips 66 (1 is potentially serious)  that you should be aware of.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

It also returned $1.2 billion through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter.Analysts at Tudor, Pickering, Holt &amp; Co, however, said Phillips' total capital return yield severely lagged that of peers, despite larger-than-expected buybacks in the third quarter.The company, which plans to boost adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization by $3 billion over the next three years, said its board had approved an additional $5 billion for stock buybacks.Phillips' hefty investor-return plan comes at a time U.S. President Joe Biden has demanded that energy companies invest their profit into boosting production before considering shareholder returns.The company also said it reduced employee headcount by 1,100 as it seeks to meet its savings target of $500 million by end-2022 and aims to save $1 billion in costs by end-2023.""These (job) reductions were communicated to employees in late October,"" Phillips spokesperson Bernardo Fallas told Reuters.It expects $2 billion in annual capital spend through 2024.""Improving our refining performance is absolutely key to enhancing our strong history of returning cash to shareholders,"" CEO Mark Lashier said on the investor call, adding that shareholders can expect an increase in annual dividends ""going forward"".(Reporting by Arunima Kumar in Bengaluru; Editing by Vinay Dwivedi and Maju Samuel)]"

110,6b032bdc-7dc8-3dcd-899a-233100404bc6,TJX,2022-11-10,TJX (TJX) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tjx-tjx-expected-beat-earnings-150003210.html,1668006003,STORY,['TJX'],"[The market expects TJX (TJX) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 16. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other stores is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.8%.Revenues are expected to be $12.27 billion, down 2.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.35% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for TJX?For TJX, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.31%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that TJX will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that TJX would post earnings of $0.67 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.69, delivering a surprise of +2.99%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.TJX appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It beat estimates for both earnings and sales, driven by growth in Eylea and Dupixent and progress on launches in pediatric atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis.  Third-quarter earnings of $11.14 per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.65. The year-ago quarter recorded earnings per share of $15.37 due to higher sales. Total revenues in the reported quarter were down 15% year over year to $2.9 billion but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.8 billion. Excluding REGEN-COV (a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies — casirivimab and imdevimab) for COVID-19, sales increased 11%.Regeneron also obtained FDA approval for the label expansion of PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc) for another indication.  The drug has been approved in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 aberrations.  The drug has been approved for patients who either have metastatic or locally advanced tumors that are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation. Patients may be treated with this combination irrespective of PD-L1 expression or histology. The latest approval is the second advanced NSCLC indication that expands the patient population eligible for a Libtayo-based regimen to include combination treatment with chemotherapy irrespective of PD-L1 expression levels.Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Lower operating expenses and share count boosted earnings in the quarter. Total revenues of $6.65 billion also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.57 billion. However, revenues declined 1% year over year due to lower product sales as higher volumes were offset by lower selling prices of several drugs and currency headwinds. The company now expects revenues in the range of $26.0 billion to $26.3 billion versus the prior expectation of $25.5 billion to $26.4 billion. Earnings are expected in the range of $17.25 to $17.85 (earlier projection: $17.00 to $18.00).Story continuesModerna MRNA reported earnings of $2.53 per share in the third quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04 and down from $7.70 in the year-ago quarter.  The year-over-year decline in the bottom line was due to lower revenues and higher operating expenses incurred during the third quarter. Revenues in the quarter were $3.36 billion, which also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.33 billion. Total revenues were down 32.3% year over year due to declining COVID-19 vaccine sales during the quarter.Following the delay of certain deliveries of its bivalent COVID-19 vaccine doses due to short-term supply-related issues, Moderna cut its annual sales forecast for its COVID-19 vaccine. Management now expects revenue from advanced purchase agreements in the range of $18-$19 billion, down from the previous guidance of nearly $21 billion. The company deferred deliveries worth $2-$3 billion to next year. Shares were down in response to the same.Verve Tanks on Update:  Shares of clinical-stage biotechnology company Verve Therapeutics, Inc. VERV tanked after the FDA placed a hold on its investigational new drug (IND) application to conduct a study evaluating VERVE-101 in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), a prevalent and potentially life-threatening subtype of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), in the United States.Verve submitted its IND application for VERVE-101 to the regulatory body last month. VERVE-101 is a novel, investigational gene editing medicine designed to be a single-course treatment to permanently turn off the PCSK9 gene in the liver to reduce disease-driving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).  Verve expects to receive an official letter with the FDA’s questions within 30 days.PerformanceThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index gained 0.20% in the past five trading sessions.

(AMGN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-amgn-trending-stock-140002468.html,1668002402,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Amgen (AMGN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this world's largest biotech drugmaker have returned +19.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.3% change. The Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, to which Amgen belongs, has gained 10.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Amgen is expected to post earnings of $3.94 per share, indicating a change of -9.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $17.64 points to a change of +3.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.66 indicates a change of +5.8% from what Amgen is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amgen.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for AMGN _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Amgen, the consensus sales estimate of $6.75 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1.5%. The $26.22 billion and $27.19 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.9% and +3.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmgen reported revenues of $6.65 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.8%. EPS of $4.70 for the same period compares with $4.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.32%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Amgen is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amgen. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

All of that changed when I was in high school. The school had recruiters from the United States Marine Corps spend the day giving speeches about their core values - honor, courage and commitment. From that moment on, I knew exactly the path I wished to take. As soon as I became of legal age in September of that year, I enlisted. Soon after that, I was on my way to Parris Island.This was my first time on a plane, and my first time away from my family without any sort of communication. When I arrived, I got to place one phone call. After that, I only received ""snail mail during my three months of basic training.You would be hard pressed to find a more diverse group than that of my fellow recruits. Not only was everyone so unique culturally, they also came from every corner of the country, resulting in a geographically diverse group, as well. I was extremely proud to have been a part of this melting pot.Toward the end of training, we went through what is called ""the crucible."" This 54-hour training is in the wilderness and requires hiking over 70 miles of terrain where you apply mental, physical and moral training you have learned during the previous weeks. With limited amounts of food and sleep received during this time, I learned to fully trust and rely on my fellow recruits.In April 2008, I was stationed in Camp Pendleton, California, as a Motor Transport Operator with the B5 Battalion and was the first woman to arrive. I thought I was going to feel alone and excluded. However, the exact opposite happened.Regardless of your background or where you grew up, everyone needs to be treated equally. Just because I was a woman in a male dominated occupation did not mean that I was exempt from the job duties. Like anyone, some tasks were more difficult for me to accomplish, however, there were many strengths that I was able to dominate, as well. Completing the same tasks and heavy physical training daily helped build life-long bonds. These Marines were no longer just people I worked alongside of, they became my new family.Story continuesI'd like to leave you with this food for thought and lessons learned. There is no ""I"" in team. Use your strength to propel yourself and others forward, and lean on others when weakness presents itself. Be teachable, and be a coach - not only in a sport but in life.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $994.64 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Wynn shares have lost about 17.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.7%.What's Next for Wynn?While Wynn has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Wynn: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we express in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic and the continued impact of its consequences, extensive regulation of our business, pending or future legal proceedings, ability to maintain gaming licenses and concessions (including with respect to our ability to extend or renew our gaming concession in Macau, which expires on December 31, 2022, and the amendments to the Macau gaming law), dependence on key employees, general global political and economic conditions, adverse tourism trends, dependence on a limited number of resorts, competition in the casino/hotel and resort industries, uncertainties over the development and success of new gaming and resort properties, construction risks, cybersecurity risk and our leverage and debt service. Additional information concerning potential factors that could affect the Company's financial results is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the Company's other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update or revise its forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.Non-GAAP Financial Measures(1) ""Adjusted Property EBITDA"" is net loss before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, pre-opening expenses, property charges and other, management and license fees, corporate expenses and other (including intercompany golf course, meeting and convention, and water rights leases), stock-based compensation, change in derivatives fair value, loss on extinguishment of debt, and other non-operating income and expenses. We use Adjusted Property EBITDA to manage the operating results of our segments. Adjusted Property EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses Adjusted Property EBITDA as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. We also present Adjusted Property EBITDA because it is used by some investors to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplement to GAAP. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their EBITDA calculations preopening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, Adjusted Property EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net loss, Adjusted Property EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, income taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in Adjusted Property EBITDA. Also, our calculation of Adjusted Property EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.(2) ""Adjusted net loss attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited"" is net loss attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited before pre-opening expenses, property charges and other, change in derivatives fair value, loss on extinguishment of debt, and foreign currency remeasurement and other, net of noncontrolling interests. Adjusted net loss attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited and adjusted net loss attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited per diluted share are presented as supplemental disclosures to financial measures in accordance with GAAP because management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are widely used to measure the performance, and as a principal basis for valuation, of gaming companies. These measures are used by management and/or evaluated by some investors, in addition to net loss and loss per share computed in accordance with GAAP, as an additional basis for assessing period-to-period results of our business. Adjusted net loss attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited and adjusted net loss attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited per diluted share may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.The Company has included schedules in the tables that accompany this release that reconcile (i) net loss attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited to adjusted net loss attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited, (ii) operating income (loss) to Adjusted Property EBITDA, and (iii) net loss attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited to Adjusted Property EBITDA.WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIESCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(in thousands, except per share data)(unaudited)Three Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,2022202120222021Operating revenues:Casino$359,876$496,264$1,209,323$1,615,228Rooms197,212173,817568,886387,772Food and beverage224,730217,501628,566435,152Entertainment, retail and other107,904107,062345,113283,287Total operating revenues889,722994,6442,751,8882,721,439Operating expenses:Casino239,901315,316808,0441,048,897Rooms67,68952,100191,474136,187Food and beverage185,388163,655517,515354,709Entertainment, retail and other72,964156,490236,853310,871General and administrative201,275197,350598,433574,669Provision for credit losses(8,186)(347)(11,331)7,461Pre-opening6,4471,33313,3965,455Depreciation and amortization172,502177,110520,026545,538Property charges and other4,73315,30177,36226,569Total operating expenses942,7131,078,3082,951,7723,010,356Operating loss(52,991)(83,664)(199,884)(288,917)Other income (expense):Interest income6,89250710,8632,131Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized(165,277)(150,325)(472,265)(453,601)Change in derivatives fair value5,8391,17614,8016,557Loss on extinguishment of debt—(738)—(2,060)Other(864)(11,784)(26,090)(17,324)Other income (expense), net(153,410)(161,164)(472,691)(464,297)Loss before income taxes(206,401)(244,828)(672,575)(753,214)Provision for income taxes(1,390)(1,155)(3,248)(2,345)Net loss(207,791)(245,983)(675,823)(755,559)Less: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests64,89979,734219,556176,963Net loss attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited$(142,892)$(166,249)$(456,267)$(578,596)Basic and diluted net loss per common share:Net loss attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited:Basic$(1.27)$(1.45)$(4.00)$(5.10)Diluted$(1.27)$(1.45)$(4.00)$(5.10)Weighted average common shares outstanding:Basic112,709114,655114,061113,420Diluted112,709114,655114,061113,420WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIESRECONCILIATION OF NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO WYNN RESORTS, LIMITEDTO ADJUSTED NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED(in thousands, except per share data)(unaudited)Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022202120222021Net loss attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited$(142,892)$(166,249)$(456,267)$(578,596)Pre-opening expenses6,4471,33313,3965,455Property charges and other4,73315,30177,36226,569Change in derivatives fair value(5,839)(1,176)(14,801)(6,557)Loss on extinguishment of debt—738—2,060Foreign currency remeasurement and other86411,78426,09017,324Income tax impact on adjustments(88)(15)(96)(87)Noncontrolling interests impact on adjustments1,380(3,418)(14,427)(4,596)Adjusted net loss attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited$(135,395)$(141,702)$(368,743)$(538,428)Adjusted net loss attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited per diluted share$(1.20)$(1.24)$(3.23)$(4.75)Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted112,709114,655114,061113,420WYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIESRECONCILIATION OF OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) TO ADJUSTED PROPERTY EBITDA(in thousands)(unaudited)Three Months Ended September 30, 2022Operatingincome(loss)Pre-openingexpensesDepreciationandamortizationPropertycharges andotherManagementand licensefeesCorporateexpenses andotherStock-basedcompensationAdjustedPropertyEBITDAMacau Operations:Wynn Palace$ (84,478)$ —$ 52,225$ 2,467$ 2,643$ 1,599$ 3,736$ (21,808)Wynn Macau(73,833)—21,1721,4192,2501,6203,566(43,806)Other Macau(4,339)—38022—3,297640—Total Macau Operations(162,650)—73,7773,9084,8936,5167,942(65,614)Las Vegas Operations103,0065,08752,7561,04225,7985,8722,199195,760Encore Boston Harbor9,60219938,8753410,3081,73638261,136Wynn Interactive(27,113)1,1614,827(213)—651...]"

123,c7053b5f-a77d-3548-bccb-e382fd12f6ad,BK,2022-11-10,10 Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-undervalued-stocks-buy-according-024919880.html,1668048559,STORY,"['BK', 'CBRE', 'SWK', 'CHTR']","[In this article, we discuss 10 undervalued stocks to buy according to Paul Tudor Jones. If you want to skip our discussion on Jones’ outlook on the economic environment, go to 5 Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones.Paul Tudor Jones, the founder of Tudor Investment Corp, believes that investors have moved on from the shareholder capitalism philosophy coined by Milton Friedman. He thinks that customers and investors are more interested in a corporation’s actions rather than its balance sheet’s strength. Actions related to the environment, safety, and governance (ESG) have taken center stage. The billionaire expressed these views in an interview with CNBC in January. Mr. Jones commented that if the intention of forming a business is to maximize profit, such businesses could lack a moral compass and would always prioritize profits over ethical policies. He discussed the example of Purdue Pharma and highlighted that the purpose of the pharmaceutical company was profit maximization first, which resulted in an opioid crisis in the US that took over 400,000 lives. Mr. Jones observed that the purpose of a business could not be truly judged without bringing ethics and morality into the conversation.Regarding the market outlook, Mr. Jones thinks that hot stocks will continue to face tough times. He opined that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell needs to review policies to fight the impact of inflation, which has run havoc on the value of assets across various classes. The Federal Reserve started raising the benchmark interest rates by 75 basis points (bps) on June 15. This was the most significant rate increase in the last 28 years. The Federal Reserve increased the interest rate to combat inflation, which has surged to a four-decade high. Mr. Jones believes that capital preservation should be the main focus of investors during such challenging times.Experts across Wall Street believe that the Federal Reserve can tip the economy into a recession by aggressive tightening schemes to control inflation. During these times, Mr. Jones prefers trend-following strategies. These strategies employ algorithmic models to highlight price trends in the market.

We believe the current valuations of  the company is compelling. Further, we believe the company is well-positioned to benefit from long-term growth opportunities that include a growing list of companies looking to outsource their commercial real estate needs, the growth in institutional ownership of commercial real estate, and attractive acquisition opportunities given their highly desirable global platforms and strong balance sheets.”CBRE Group, Inc.

(NYSE:SWK) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Stanley Black &amp; Decker performed well through the first part of the year but struggled over the summer. China accounts for much of its production, and their zero-tolerance approach to pandemic safety measures has led to disruption, compounded by shipping difficulties and rising materials expenses. We still believe one outcome of the pandemic will be a buoyant home improvement market, given that one never knows when the next pandemic lockdown may occur.”As of Q1 2022, 38 funds held a stake in Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Tudor Investment Corp’s Holdings: $11,476,000Percentage of Tudor Investment Corp’s Portfolio: 0.26%PE Ratio as of July 1: 10.53Return since June 30th: 2.7%The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) is a New York-based investment banking services corporation and is considered an important bank in the US financial system by the Federal Stability Board (FSB).On July 1, Gerard Cassidy at RBC Capital kept a Sector Perform rating on The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) with a price target of $49, reflecting a 15% upside potential. The analyst reduced the target price on The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) from $56 after lowering his FY22 EPS forecast from $4.68 to $4.36 and FY23 EPS forecast from $5.43 to $4.95. The analyst reduced the forecast to incorporate the current market conditions. Investment bank services companies like The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) are highly sensitive to interest rate changes as there will be a runoff on deposits due to rising interest rates.However, the company has solid business fundamentals. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) increased its quarterly dividend by 9.67% in July 2021 to $0.34 per share. The company’s dividend yield stands at 3.21% as of July 1. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) has increased its dividend for 11 consecutive years.Here’s what Ariel Investments said about The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Rising interest rates, after a surprisingly long period of low absolute rates and negative “real” rates, will create a headwind. While there has been much debate about the cause of these low rates, we believe the most important factor has been the $120 billion in monthly federal reserve open market bond purchases and the accumulation of an $8 trillion balance sheet. The former will end, and the latter will shrink. It is not just the Fed that has aggressively purchased bonds, bidding up prices and lowering yields. Bond traders and hedge fund managers have added to positions, confident that being on the same side as the Fed was the wise place to be. Now as the Fed is about to become a seller of bonds rather than a buyer, Wall Street’s “smart money” is likely to follow suit. Against this backdrop, fixed income securities and bond substitutes such as high dividend paying utilities and absolute return hedge funds are substantially overpriced and are not likely to produce attractive returns going forward.This expectation of a reversion to the mean for interest rates helped 2021 performance, though not as much as we had hoped. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury did indeed increase from +0.92% at the beginning of the year to +1.52% at year-end. An underreported story was the poor performance of bonds last year. The Barclays Aggregate Index declined -1.67% for the year ending December compared to a return of +28.71% for equities as measured by the S&amp;P 500. Interest rates have continued to climb in 2022 with the 10-year Treasury at +1.79% as we go to print. This move higher in rates has contributed to our good, early start to 2022. Smaller positions in The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) also benefited from higher rates, principally with their ability to invest customer cash.”The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) was held by 54 hedge funds as of Q1 2022.In addition to Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK), popular companies such as Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are also a part of Jones Q1 2022 portfolio.Click to continue reading and see 5 Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones. Suggested Articles:10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy According to Ken FisherTop 10 Stock Picks of Jeffrey Diehl’s Adams Street Partners10 Important Stocks In Billionaire Richard Chilton’s Latest PortfolioDisclosure: None. 10 Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones is originally published on Insider Monkey]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Growth Stock Portfolio: 5 Stock Picks By Warren Buffett. Investors for the past few months have been piling into companies with resilient growth prospects over cheaper value stocks. This drastic change of pace is supported by varying views on interest rates, inflation, and the likelihood of a US recession. Investors are closely monitoring growth sensitive stocks as it is foolish to ignore the value in high-quality tech stocks in the current environment.Rampant inflation and government’s plans to withhold the fiscal stimulus from the COVID-era bludgeoned growth stocks in the first half of 2022, but the recession fears have caused the tables to turn and growth stocks are shining again. Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America, told Financial Times in August 2022: “Investors were obsessed about inflation risks in the first half of the year and they are now haunted by worries about recession. That explains the violence of the flip in sentiment to growth stocks from value.” In times of market uncertainty, investors turn towards market titans like Warren Buffett. Some of the best growth stocks in his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio include Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO). Our Methodology We selected the top 10 growth stocks from the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 for this analysis. The stocks are arranged according to Berkshire's stake value in each holding. Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. Growth Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock Picks By Warren BuffettGrowth Stock Portfolio: Stock Picks By Warren Buffett10. Floor &amp; Decor Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:FND)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29P/E Ratio as of November 9: 26.32Floor &amp; Decor Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:FND) was founded in 2000 and is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. It operates as a specialty retailer of commercial flooring, hard surface flooring, and related accessories. Warren Buffett owns 4.78 million shares of Floor &amp; Decor Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:FND) as of Q2 2022, worth nearly $301 million and representing 0.13% of the total holdings. Story continuesOn November 3, Floor &amp; Decor Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:FND) reported its Q3 results, posting earnings per share of $0.70 and a revenue of $1.10 billion, outperforming market estimates by $0.05 and $5.25 million, respectively. Baird analyst Justin Kleber on November 4 maintained an Outperform rating on Floor &amp; Decor Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:FND) but lowered the price target on the shares to $90 from $95. The analyst observed that although its disruptive model continues to rack up impressive share gains, the weakness in housing turnover is starting to pressure the fundamentals. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 29 hedge funds were bullish on Floor &amp; Decor Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:FND) at the end of June 2022, compared to 30 funds in the prior quarter. Colin Moran’s Abdiel Capital Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 4.3 million shares worth $273.8 million.  Like Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Moody's Corporation (NYSE:MCO), Floor &amp; Decor Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:FND) is one of the top growth picks of Warren Buffett. Here is what Madison Funds specifically said about Floor &amp; Decor Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:FND) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Floor &amp; Decor Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:FND) is the dominant category killer retailer of tile, wood, stone, and resilient flooring products into the renovation and replacement market. This is a business we know quite well, having successfully invested in the company from 2018-2020. We believe the company is early in its store opening phase, with many more years of expansion left. Its stock has come down meaningfully from its highs given concerns over a slowing housing market and more cautious consumer. While these concerns have merit, the resulting valuation discount appears opportunistic for long-term investors.”9. Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26P/E Ratio as of November 9: 673.43Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL) is an American company involved in the insurance, reinsurance, and investment businesses around the world. In the second quarter of 2022, Berkshire Hathaway owned 467,611 shares of Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL) worth about $605 million, representing 0.20% of the total portfolio. The hedge fund boosted its stake in the company by 12% during the June quarter. On November 1, Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL) reported a Q3 GAAP EPS of $3.50 and earned premiums of $1.96 billion, up 20.2% year-over-year. Truist analyst Mark Hughes on August 5 maintained a Hold rating on Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL) and lowered the price target on the shares to $1,300 from $1,500 after its Q2 results.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 26 hedge funds were long Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL), compared to 29 funds in the prior quarter. Brian Ashford-Russell and Tim Woolley’s Polar Capital held a prominent stake in the company, with 115,400 shares worth $149.2 million. Here is what Vltava Fund has to say about Markel Corporation (NYSE:MKL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“While it is true that Berkshire Hathaway’s unique and successful business model has for decades been apparent for all to see, it is interesting that almost no one has been able to replicate it. In fact, this should not be all that surprising, though, because, first of all, it would be very difficult to do so and, second, it would take an awfully long time. A company that is following in BRK’s footsteps and has probably gone the furthest down that path is Markel. Moreover, it is not doing badly at all. From its stock market listing in 1986 to today, Markel has returned only slightly lower than BRK and substantially more than those of the index.MKL’s business model, like BRK’s, is founded upon insurance companies that produce a growing amount of cash (so-called float) which can be invested over the long term into both publicly traded stocks and private companies. Markel CEO Tom Gayner therefore talks about the three pillars upon which the company is built. The first is insurance companies. These are very profitable in their own right over the long term and also produce the aforementioned float. This has enabled MKL to build up an investment portfolio of USD 26 billion (the second pillar) as well as a portfolio of private firms through Markel Ventures (the third pillar)…” (Click here to see the full text)8.

(NASDAQ:TMUS) to $201 from $187 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares.

(NASDAQ:TMUS):“As mentioned, the communication services sector has come under some pressure, and irrational pricing competition has negatively impacted wireless industry growth and profitability of late, weighing on T-Mobile. Faced with these headwinds, and with pressure from other wireless carriers and cable companies that could cause the company to cede share in subscriber growth in 2022, we exited our position in the fourth quarter.”7. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 252P/E Ratio as of November 9: 81.80Amazon.com, Inc.

The company’s amazon web services business provides utility-scale cloud offerings that facilitate corporate America’s transition to digital systems. Shares outperformed during the quarter as investors were encouraged by strong second-quarter performance despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. Moreover, the company’s retail segment was resilient and avoided discounting inventory like some major retailers did. Revenues for the company’s cloud computing segment, amazon web services (AWS), grew faster than analysts’ estimates during the quarter due to continuing corporate demand for digitization. As a result, management provided better-than-expected forward guidance.”6.

The quarterly results were hurt by lower revenues and transactions in the Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) segment, which usually contributes a massive chunk to WU’s overall revenues.The segment was affected by discontinuation of operations across Russia and Belarus. Nevertheless, the downside was partly offset by a lower expense level and double-digit growth in U.S. outbound new digital customer acquisition.The Western Union Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe Western Union Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe Western Union Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Western Union Company QuoteQ3 ResultsWestern Union reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 42 cents, matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Both earnings and revenue beat ratios of 66.7% and 61.9%, respectively, also seem impressive. Combining the actual results with the estimates for the still-to-report companies, total earnings for the sector are expected to decline 3.8% on revenue growth of 4.5% (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).Many industry bigwigs reported solid results with some beating on earnings or revenues or both. However, solid earnings failed to fully impress pharma ETFs over the past month. VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF PPH, iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF IHE, Invesco Dynamic Pharmaceuticals ETF PJP, SPDR S&amp;P Pharmaceuticals ETF XPH and First Trust Nasdaq Pharmaceuticals ETF FTXH are modestly up to down in a month.Let’s delve deeper into earnings of some of the bigwigs:Earnings in FocusJohnson and JohnsonThe world's biggest healthcare products’ maker continued its long streak of earnings beat. Earnings per share came in at $2.55, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.49 but deteriorating 1.9% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 1.8% year over year to $23.8 billion and edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.3 billion (read: JNJ Beats on Q3 Earnings: ETFs in Focus).For 2022, Johnson &amp; Johnson lifted its sales growth target to 6.7-7.2% from the previous guidance of 6.5-7.5%. However, the earnings per share guidance range has been revised down slightly from $10.00-$10.10 to $10.02-$10.07, representing year-over-year growth of 2.3-2.8%.PfizerPfizer topped on earnings and revenues. Earnings per share of $1.78 were well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.47. Revenues of $22.6 billion fell short of the consensus mark of $21.04 billion. On a year-over-year basis, earnings increased 40% and revenues fell 6%, respectively. The U.S. drug giant raised the lower end of the 2022 revenue guidance to $99.5-$102 billion from $98-102 billion but lowered the earnings guidance to $6.240$6.50 from $6.30-$6.45 per share.MerckMerck also reported better-than-expected results. Earnings per share of $1.85 outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67 and increased 4% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues rose 14% year over year to $14.96 billion and came in above the consensus mark of $14.1 billion. For 2022, Merck lifted the revenue guidance to $58.5-$59 billion from $57.5-$58.5 billion and the earnings guidance to $7.32-$7.37 from $7.25-$7.35.Bristol-MyersBristol-Myers reported earnings per share of $1.99, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.83 and improving from the year-ago earnings of $1.93.

EBS reported an adjusted loss of $1.27 per share in third-quarter 2022, significantly wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents. In the year-ago quarter, EBS reported a loss of 36 cents per share.Revenues in the reported quarter were $240 million, down 27% from the prior-year period’s level. The revenue decline was caused by a reduction in COVID-related contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) revenues. Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $268 million.Shares of Emergent BioSolutions have declined 21.2% in the year compared with the industry’s 20.9% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarter in DetailTotal product sales decreased 31.2% from the year-ago quarter’s level to $186.2 million, owing to the year-over-year decreased sales of Narcan nasal spray, ACAM2000 and other products. The decline was slightly offset by a solid year-over-year increase in anthrax vaccine sales.Sales of anthrax vaccines (BioThrax and AV7909) were $24.2 million in the reported quarter, up 55.1% year over year. The increase in sales of anthrax vaccines can be attributed to the timely deliveries of the Anthrax vaccines to the U.S Government (USG), specifically the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).Emergent received an AV7909 contract modification in September 2021 valued at approximately $399 million to deliver additional AV7909 doses to the USG through March 2023.Narcan (naloxone HCl) nasal spray added $87.9 million to product sales, down 34.1% year over year. The decline in sales can be attributed to erosion in sales following the launch of a generic in December 2021. The downside was slightly offset by higher volumes of Narcan sprays sold to public interest customers in the United States and Canada and from the sales of the aforementioned authorized generic product licensed to Sandoz, the generic arm of Novartis NVS.Emergent authorized Novartis’ generic arm, Sandoz, to distribute a generic Narcan nasal spray, launched in the United States in December 2021.Story continuesEmergent reported $49 million in revenues for its smallpox vaccine ACAM2000 in the third quarter, down 39.3% year over year. The decline was due to fewer doses sold to the U.S. Government. The downfall was partially offset by a rise in the number of doses sold to the non-U. S customers at a higher price per dose.Other product sales were $25.1 million, down 38.6% year over year.Revenues from contracts and grants increased 3% year over year to $17.4 million.Total CDMO revenues reached 36.4 million, compared to the year-ago quarter’s revenues of $41.6 million. While CDMO services revenues declined 67.9% year over year to $36.2 million, the CDMO lease revenues increased $71.2 million from the year-ago quarter, reaching $0.2 million.The decline in CDMO services revenues was due to lower combined revenues of $82 million from AstraZeneca AZN and Janssen, a Johnson &amp;Johnson JNJ subsidiary, which resulted in lower production-related work carried out at one of Emergent’s facilities, which reduced manufacturing activities. Emergent reversed $8.3 million of previously recognized revenues under the Janssen contract.In July 2020, J&amp;J and Emergent entered into an agreement to provide contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) services for J&amp;J’s single-shot, adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccine for five years. In June 2022, the companies announced their decision to terminate the deal, citing contract breaches.The increase in CDMO lease revenues was driven by the reversal of revenues of $86 million in the third quarter of 2021 related to Emergent’s public-private COVID-19 development partnership with BARDA in November 2021. The increase was partially offset by a $15.1-million decline in lease revenues related to the contract with Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson.We note that Emergent had received a setback last year when there was a manufacturing mishap at its Bayview facility where COVID-19 vaccine ingredients of J&amp;J and AstraZeneca reportedly got mixed and led to several faulty batches of J&amp;J’s vaccine. Emergent lost its contract for AstraZeneca’s vaccine following the mishap.Emergent reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $15.2 million for the third quarter, wider than the year-ago quarter’s loss of $3.3 million.Emergent Biosolutions Inc.

The company has raised the revenue guidance for Narcan nasal spray and smallpox vaccine. It now expects revenues from smallpox vaccine to be in the range of $63-$63 million compared with the previously guided range of $225-$250 million. Revenues from the Narcan nasal spray are expected to be between $350-$365 million, up from $300-$340 million expected previously.

HALO reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of 74 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents. Adjusted earnings were also higher than our estimate of 56 cents per share. The company’s earnings were 55 cents per share in the year-ago period.Total revenues increased 80% year over year to $209 million, primarily driven by strong royalty payments from J&amp;J JNJ for subcutaneous Darzalex (daratumumab). The addition of product sales following the acquisition of Antares Pharma in May and higher collaboration revenues also boosted the top line. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $188 million.Total revenues were also higher than our estimate of $187.7 million in the reported quarter.Shares of Halozyme were up 4.2% in after-hours trading on Tuesday following the better-than-expected results.

The company has five marketed partnered drugs based on this technology, including the subcutaneous formulation of J&amp;J’s Darzalex and Roche’s RHHBY Phesgo.Royalty revenues were $99.6 million in the third quarter, up 70% from the year-ago quarter, mainly driven by robust demand for J&amp;J’s subcutaneous Darzalex and to a lesser extent, Roche’s Phesgo. Royalty revenues generated nearly 47.6% of the total revenues for the company during the third quarter.Product sales were $61.4 million in the quarter, significantly up from the year-ago quarter. The company supplies API to ENHANZE partners like J&amp;J and Roche.Revenues under collaborative agreements were $48 million, up almost 49% year over year. This increase was due to milestone recognitions from Roche and Bristol Myers.Story continuesResearch and development expenses increased 96.5% year over year to $16.7 million, mainly due to planned investments in the ENHANZE technology, as well as one-time compensation costs incurred by HALO related to the Antares Pharma acquisition.Selling, general and administrative expenses were $34.5 million, significantly up from the year-ago period. The rise was mainly on account of one-time compensation costs incurred by HALO for the Antares Pharma acquisition as well as higher compensation expenses related to the ongoing combined larger workforce.2022 GuidanceHalozyme reiterated its guidance for revenues and earnings that it had provided in August.The company expects total revenues in the range of $655-$685 million in 2022.The revenue guidance indicates year-over-year growth of 48-55%.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 82% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 7.6% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 33% for shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. Hence, if weakness in Medtronic's share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Medtronic. See our latest analysis for Medtronic ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Medtronic?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Medtronic already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Medtronic's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Medtronic. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.3% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.4% of the company stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of MedtronicWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Medtronic plc. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$95m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 17% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Medtronic. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

This compares to earnings of $0.25 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -19.23%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of animal health products and nutritional supplements would post earnings of $0.40 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.36, delivering a surprise of -10%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Phibro , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry, posted revenues of $232.5 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.71%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $214.7 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Phibro shares have lost about 27.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.7%.What's Next for Phibro?While Phibro has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Phibro: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.36 on $242.74 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.33 on $979.82 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Products is currently in the top 50% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Medtronic (MDT), has yet to report results for the quarter ended October 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 22.This medical device company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3%.

The quarterly results were hurt by lower revenues and transactions in the Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) segment, which usually contributes a massive chunk to WU’s overall revenues.The segment was affected by discontinuation of operations across Russia and Belarus. Nevertheless, the downside was partly offset by a lower expense level and double-digit growth in U.S. outbound new digital customer acquisition.The Western Union Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe Western Union Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe Western Union Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Western Union Company QuoteQ3 ResultsWestern Union reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 42 cents, matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

The segment’s revenue, however, fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,001 million.Transactions within the C2C segment fell 12% year over year due to lower transactions across Europe and CIS, North America, East Asia and Oceania (APAC) and the Middle East, Africa and South Asia (MEASA).Digital money transfer revenues dropped 12% year over year on a reported basis or 9% on a constant currency basis in the third quarter.

The midpoint of the guidance indicates a 17.8% decline from the 2021 reported figure.Operating profit margin is expected between 20% and 21%. The metric stood at 22.5% in 2021.Update on Business Solutions Sell-OffLast year, Western Union had inked a deal with Goldfinch Partners LLC and The Baupost Group LLC to divest its Business Solutions unit in two stages. The first closing took place on Mar 1, 2022.However, in the third quarter, with the mutual consent of all the parties to the divestiture agreement, a decision was taken to divest Business Solutions in three stages. The second closing related to the sale of the United Kingdom operations is expected in December 2022.

And because every community is different, we commit to working with organizations that are a part of those communities to help make certain diseases a thing of the past.We've made great progress, but we know we can do more.""We're resolute in our goal to ensure the advancement and delivery of medicines and vaccines to help save and improve lives around the world.""Andrew ""Drew"" Otoo, PharmDPresident, global vaccines""Through our various partnerships, I've witnessed the power of the private sector in bringing affordable and accessible medical services, treatments and diagnostics directly to people globally,"" said Dr. Otoo.We're committed to fighting vaccine-preventable diseases and boosting global vaccination ratesWe have teams around the world working to better understand and help solve the unique challenges communities face in securing access to the right medicines and vaccines with life-saving potential.""To expand our reach, we need to reimagine how we do business.

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 11.5% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $101.97 in the previous session. Merck has gained 32.4% since the start of the year compared to the -18.1% move for the Zacks Medical sector and the 6.5% return for the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 27, 2022, Merck reported EPS of $1.85 versus consensus estimate of $1.67.For the current fiscal year, Merck is expected to post earnings of $7.38 per share on $59.04 billion in revenues. This represents a 22.59% change in EPS on a 17.71% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $7.34 per share on $58.34 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -0.5% and -1.19%, respectively.Valuation MetricsMerck may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Merck has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and F, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 13.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 13.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 13.9X versus its peer group's average of 10.5X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.35. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Merck currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Merck fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Merck shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A new video (above) demonstrates how West Virginia University (WVU) and Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) together devised a solution for cleaning up this pollutant at the watershed level.In addition to turning acid mine drainage into clean water, Paul Ziemkiewicz, Ph.D., Director of Water Research at WVU and his team discovered that the remaining AMD sludge was a source of rare earth elements (REE).""Acid mine drainage happens when coal waste rock weathers and forms sulfuric acid,"" Ziemkiewicz said. ""The acid leaches all manner of metal pollutants out of rock, so why wouldn't it leach rare earths? Mother Nature does that heavy lifting for free. Fortunately, AMD is, in fact, enriched in rare earth elements and critical materials in an easily recovered form. Best of all, you can't recover them without treating AMD to environmental standards. Our byproduct is clean water.""Rockwell provided sensor and control technology, and developed a pilot plant for REE extraction, to help push this sustainability initiative forward. WVU has plans to launch REE production from acid mine drainage across the United States.In this interview, learn more about how Rockwell and WVU are joining forces on sustainability initiatives.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Rockwell Automation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Rockwell AutomationWebsite: www.rockwellautomation.comEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Rockwell AutomationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/724780/Turning-Acid-Mine-Drainage-Into-Clean-Water]"

In the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average earnings surprise of 167.62%.Factors to ConsiderA solid order backlog and strength in the orders of executive aviation must have contributed to Embraer’s third-quarter revenues. Also, an improvement in orders from the defense line of business is expected to have contributed to Embraer’s third-quarter 2022 revenues.Meanwhile, the improved performance expected from the service and support business unit might have aided ERJ’s overall third-quarter revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.20 billion, suggesting growth of 24.8% from the year-ago quarter.From the earnings perspective, the product and service mix pricing and the overall operational performance, including tax efficiencies, might have contributed to Embraer’s overall third-quarter earnings. Also, Embraer’s continuous efforts to deleverage its balance sheet may have weighed down the interest expense of the company, thus benefiting the bottom line in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, the deliveries of aircraft are projected to be more concentrated in the second half of 2022, buoyed by improved economic conditions lately. This may have aided the margins of the company, which must have contributed to its third-quarter earnings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 15 cents per share, indicating an improvement of 183.3% from the prior-year reported figure.EmbraerEmpresa Brasileira de Aeronautica Price and EPS SurpriseEmbraerEmpresa Brasileira de Aeronautica Price and EPS SurpriseEmbraerEmpresa Brasileira de Aeronautica price-eps-surprise | EmbraerEmpresa Brasileira de Aeronautica QuoteWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Embraer this time.

That at least seems to be Jim Cramer’s latest piece of advice for investors. The well-known host of CNBC’s ‘Mad Money’ program says investors need to accept the “new reality” in which tech names are shunned aside in favor of the stock market’s more vintage collection.“It’s the revenge of the old guard right now, right here,” Cramer said. “All sorts of boring, conventional companies are taking back the market while the digitizers and disruptors are being burned.”Cramer offered a list of names he thinks investors should lean into and following his footsteps, we dipped into the TipRanks database and pulled up the details on two of his picks. Do the Street’s analysts think Cramer’s nominees make sound investment choices right now? Let’s find out.Raytheon Technologies (RTX)If we’re talking of the “old guard,” then the first Cramer pick we’ll look at certainly fits the bill. Formed a century ago, Raytheon Technologies is one of the largest aerospace and defense manufacturers in the world and boasts a market-cap of $141 billon.The company offers technology systems and services to government, military, and commercial clients all across the globe. Its business consists of 4 major divisions: Collins Aerospace Systems, Pratt &amp; Whitney, Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space, and Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense. How big is Raytheon? Well, it has 174,000 employees on the payroll, so rather huge.The kind of value proposition it offers is one you would think would relatively shield it from the negative current market conditions, and indeed while most have suffered at the hands of 2022’s bear, the stock is up by 13% year-to-date, far outpacing the S&amp;P 500’s 21% drop.That said, it has not been all plain sailing. The company missed top-line expectations in its recently released Q3 results. At $17 billion, the figure came in $250 million shy of the analysts’ forecast. Macro issues weighed on the outlook too, with the company lowering its sales forecast for the year from the range between $67.75 - $68.75 billion to 67.0 - $67.3 billion.Story continuesHowever, countering those negative trends, the profitability profile appears in good shape. Raytheon delivered adj. EPS of $1.21, beating the Street’s $1.14 call by $0.07. At the same time, the company increased the full year adj. EPS outlook from $4.60 - $4.80 to $4.70 - $4.80.As befits a grand dame of the market, Raytheon pays a reliable dividend. The quarterly payout currently stands at $0.55 which annualizes to $2.20 and yields 2.3%.While the shares have outpaced the market this year, Morgan Stanley’s Kristine Liwag thinks the stock is still not appreciated enough.“We continue to see upside in RTX’s commercial aerospace business as commercial aftermarket remains a bright spot with airlines continuing to add capacity and global air traffic remaining ~65% of 2019 levels (August YTD 2022 vs. August YTD 2019). We also see the business as a benefactor from increased production rates at Boeing and Airbus,"" Liwag opined.""Given the backdrop facing RTX’s end markets, we see the stock undervalued today trading at ~17x our 2023E EPS. This places the stock at a pure discount to Defense peers and does not consider the magnitude of upside from commercial aerospace recovery,"" the analyst added.Accordingly, Liwag rated RTX shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy) while her $119 price target makes room for one-year growth of 24%. (To watch Liwag’s track record, click here)Overall, we’re looking here at a stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. RTX has 11 analyst reviews on record, including 8 Buys and 3 Holds. (See RTX stock forecast on TipRanks)Boeing (BA)From one A&amp;D giant to another. The second Cramer old school recommendation is Boeing. The corporation, which is the U.S.’s largest exporter, manufactures commercial aircrafts as well as space systems, aerospace components and defense equipment.Boeing is one of the stock market’s giants but, as has been well documented, has had its fair share of troubles over the past few years, not least the two 737 Max crashes in late 2018 and early 2019 which grounded the passenger airliner for almost two years. The company also almost went bankrupt during the pandemic.So, the past few years have been a bit of a slog and while the company missed expectations in its latest quarterly statement and once again slashed its estimate of 737 deliveries, things are generally looking better - more planes have already been delivered by the company in 2022 than in all of 2021. Additionally, the A&amp;D giant latterly disclosed a new order from Emirates – a key client in the Middle East.Elsewhere, BA’s recent Investor Day was a pleasing affair. The company said it expects free cash flow of $1.5 billion-$2 billion for 2022. The consensus estimate stood at just $670.3 million.Among those adapting a bullish approach is Morgan Stanley’s Kristine Liwag (also covers RTX), who believes the worst is behind the company.“We left Boeing’s Investor Day incrementally more positive on the stock as the company provided unexpected supporting details for a visible and credible path to $10bn of free cashflow... What’s clear to us is that even though Boeing has a lot of work to do (stabilizing the supply chain, delivering aircraft from inventory, preparing for the next rate break in BCA, etc.) the worst is behind the company and we’re now in a period of positive free cash flow. We’re forecasting free cash flow of $8.9bn in 2025 and $9.1bn in 2026,"" Liwag wrote.""We recognize that Boeing is a 'show me' story and there could be upside to our estimates if they meet milestones,"" the Morgan Stanley analyst summed up.How does this all translate to investors? Liwag sticks with an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on Boeing shares, while her $213 price target implies ~27% upside a year from now.Turning now to the rest of the Street, where the analyst consensus rates the stock a Moderate Buy, based on 11 Buys, 3 Holds and 1 Sell.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the elevated P/E.Recent earnings growth for Southern has been in line with the market. It might be that many expect the mediocre earnings performance to strengthen positively, which has kept the P/E from falling. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Southern peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Southern.Does Growth Match The High P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Southern would need to produce impressive growth in excess of the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company managed to grow earnings per share by a handy 12% last year. Ultimately though, it couldn't turn around the poor performance of the prior period, with EPS shrinking 29% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the eleven analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 11% each year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be similar to the 9.4% each year growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's curious that Southern's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.The Bottom Line On Southern's P/EUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesOur examination of Southern's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.Before you take the next step, you should know about the 4 warning signs for Southern (1 is significant!) that we have uncovered.You might be able to find a better investment than Southern.

We’ve done three Nike shoes, as well three New Balance ones with more in the pipeline,” said Smart, and they’ve been met with success thanks to The Basement’s community.Ropes and Smart came together after bonding over creating something that was representative of young people. Smart was editorial manager at premium streetwear retailer End, and Ropes ran youth charities and started his own shoelace company, which was the first external brand to be stocked by Nike.“It’s a combination of commercial experience and understanding the sneaker culture combined heavily with third-sector charitable background, which makes The Basement a company that has social missions and ambitions not just making money and putting out cool s–t, if it doesn’t add value or purpose to our community of young people then we’re not interested, either,” said Ropes. That ethos has helped catapult the brand into a tight-knit hub.Issue one of The Basement.While the fashion and media industry moves forward with digitization, The Basement is taking a different approach by stepping back into traditional media and launching a print magazine.“We decided it was a good time to move into a different media property to give a voice to people who may traditionally be excluded from having a voice in print or a traditional media landscape,” said Smart, who still believes that there’s a permanence to print that isn’t available online.Story continuesSmart and Ropes consulted their growing community before starting the project. Their core demographic is 16- to 24-year olds.The feedback they received from their members was that they all wanted content that was longer form and more traditional as opposed to 15 second reels and TikTok videos.None of the names in the debut issue are recognizable to media insiders — instead, they are all community members who have pitched in to create the larger than A4 magazine with the brand name in gloss.The Basement’s goal is to reach young people, but not to dictate new trends to them. When Smart and Ropes looked at what was missing from the print market, they found that magazine covers were being predominantly shot by established photographers or their offsprings, which they feel has caused a knock on effect for free labor within the fashion industry.The pair made it a priority to pay every contributor in the magazine, which is more than 230 pages with two double spreads dedicated to young brands that were not able to afford advertising.A preview from issue one of The Basement magazine.The features inside the magazine cover topics from colonialism, to spotlighting members of the community, to interviews with creatives, including Cole Buxton of UVU, a young luxury sportswear label, and Hector Dockrill, the director of Post Malone’s documentary “Runaway.”The Basement is working to move away from Facebook and launch its own platform, which is in its beta stages.On Facebook, they have more than 150,000 members and counting with a firm waiting list.Joining The Basement is the equivalent of waiting for an Hermès Birkin bag in the streetwear world — with some users waiting around two years until they’re accepted, but it’s not because the founders want to be gatekeepers.Smart and Ropes checklist each member and ask them a series of questions before letting them into the community with a strict policy for no racism, sexism, homophobia or trolling.The Basement, like its name, wants to stay put with its core audience — and there’s always space — but the price to pay is patience.]"

NVAX incurred a loss of $2.15 per share for third-quarter 2022, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of $2.21. In the year-ago quarter, NVAX posted a loss of $4.31 per share.Revenues for the quarter were $735 million, up 311% year over year. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $552 million.Shares of Novavax have plunged 86.3% this year compared with the industry’s 21.5% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarter in DetailDuring the third quarter, NVAX sold 35 million doses of NVX-CoV2373, its protein-based COVID-19 vaccine. The company generated $626 million in product sales. In the year-ago quarter, the company did not record any product sales. In the previous quarter, the company generated product sales worth $55.5 million.NVAX recorded $2.2 million of revenues from royalties and adjuvant sales to license partners.Novavax’s grant revenues declined 21.3% year over year to $106 million for the same period as it completed the activities required under the agreements with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.In the reported quarter, research and development expenses were $304 million, down 25.5% year over year. The downside was caused by a $98-million benefit received by the company following its settlement of a manufacturing agreement.Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 58% year over year to $123 million. The rise in expenses was due to activities to support the commercialization of NVX-CoV2373.As of Sep 30, 2022, Novavax had $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents compared with $1.4 billion as of Jun 30, 2022.2022 Guidance LoweredNovavax lowered its total revenue guidance for the year. It expects to record total revenues of- around $2 billion, which is at the low end of its previously-expected guidance of $2 billion and $2.3 billion.Recent UpdatesIn a separate press release, Novavax announced topline results from a late-stage study evaluating NVX-CoV2515, its Omicron BA.1 vaccine candidate and bivalent COVID vaccine. The bivalent vaccine is a combination of NVX-CoV2373 and NVX-CoV2515. The study met the primary strain-change endpoint, with a greater neutralizing antibody response when compared to patients administered the original vaccine NVX-CoV2373. However, data from the study did not show any benefit of Novavax’s bivalent vaccine when compared to the original vaccine or the Omicron BA.1 vaccine candidate.Story continuesOverall, Novavax’s COVID vaccine gained authorization for use of its COVID vaccine in more than 40 countries. As of Nov 8, management claims to have delivered over 94 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine worldwide. The companycontinues to garner authorizations for using its COVID-19 vaccine in additional countries and for additional patient populations.During the quarter, Novavax securedauthorization from the FDA to use its COVID vaccine as a primary two-dose regimen in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and above. Last month, the vaccine also received the regulatory agency’s authorization for using a booster dose in adults as a heterologous or homologous shot. Similar authorizations have also been secured by the company in Europe.Novavax is also evaluating the vaccine across multiple studies. Earlier this August, management initiated the phase IIb/III Hummingbird study evaluating a primary two-dose regimen of its COVID vaccine in younger children aged six months to 11 years of age. Initial data from this study is expected in first-quarter 2023.Last month, Novavax announced updated topline data from a phase I/II study evaluating the safety and tolerability of its COVID-19-Influenza Combination (CIC) vaccine candidate. The CIC vaccine is a combination of NVX-CoV2373 and Novavax’s seasonal influenza vaccine candidate in a single formulation. The CIC vaccine candidate proved feasible, well-tolerated and immunogenic, inducing antibody and T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 and homologous and heterologous influenza strains in the subjects. Based on these results, management intends to start a phase II confirmation study by the end of this year.Novavax’s COVID vaccine faces stiff competition from the mRNA-based COVID vaccines developed by Moderna MRNA and Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX. While Novavax is yet to tap the potential of the U.S. market, Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech are currently way ahead of the curve. The vaccines they developed dominate the U.S. market and are the only jabs that have received full approval for use. The vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are approved/authorized for use in individuals as young as six months.Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech have also developed their respective bivalent vaccines, which have been authorized for use in children as young as five years. Novavax is yet to make a regulatory filing for its bivalent booster vaccine.Novavax, Inc. Price Novavax, Inc. PriceNovavax, Inc. price | Novavax, Inc.

It’s CEO Max Levchin’s 30-year plan,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/affirm-down-credit-card-industry-193000838.html,1668022200,STORY,"['AFRM', 'PYPL']","[On this week’s episode of Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast, co-hosts Alan Murray and Ellen McGirt talk with Max Levchin, CEO of Affirm, about his reasons for founding the lending company and the long-term mission to upend the credit card industry.Listen to the episode or read the full transcript below.TranscriptAlan Murray: Leadership Next is powered by the folks at Deloitte, who, like me, are super focused on how CEOs can lead in the context of disruption and evolving societal expectations. Welcome to Leadership Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership.I'm Alan Murray, and I'm here with my incomparable co-host, Ellen McGirt. Bam. Ellen, how are you? I have a question for you when you tell me how you are.Ellen McGirt: I am great. I am back to full health and I'm happy to be back on the job and—what's your question? I'm dying to know.Murray: My question is: Do you know what the PayPal Mafia is?McGirt:  You know, I do, and I feel a little bad about it because, Alan, I know that you only know me as a loyal Fortune employee but for a brief period of time, maybe six seven years, I did work for a competitor magazine and I did get a chance to meet and interview almost all the PayPal Mafia.Murray: Wow. But Fortune, I believe, and we can ask our guest this, I believe, that PayPal Mafia was a phrase that not everyone loved that came out of a Fortune cover story. And it's the founders of PayPal, who then went on to create many other businesses. That includes Elon Musk, it includes Reid Hoffman, it includes Peter Thiel and it includes our guest, Max Levchin. Welcome to Leadership Next.Max Levchin: Thank you for the wonderful intro, and that's correct, for better or worse.McGirt: I'm thinking the PayPal mafia cover was an iconic moment in business. You scooped everyone as you often do. But you were all very different from each other. I mean, Alan, you just named sort of a gallery of personalities, and it was extraordinary how well PayPal did and all of your various inputs and influences and how interesting careers you've all had outside of it once you parted company. So I think, maybe mafia is not the right the right framing for it, but it was certainly an interesting moment. Max, what do you think?Story continuesLevchin: It was definitely a zeitgeist-y, if that's an appropriate adjective. We don't love the mafia term, just for the record. I think most of the PayPal crew thinks of ourselves, still, as really good friends. Even the occasional rivals maintain really good friendships. And so we all really enjoy each other's company and do not think of ourselves organized crime.Murray: So that will be the last reference to organized crime in this podcast. So let's dive into what you're doing now, Max. Affirm. Let's just start with what you were trying to do when you founded Affirm.Levchin: Sure. I was born in Ukraine and came to the U.S. as a teenager. Before PayPal before, before university, before everything, really, as I started my sort of American life. I found out the hard way that if you don't have a credit record you don't exist, and I sort of got this sort of canonical on-campus credit card, promptly ruined my credit rating, like all the things you're supposed to do, as in large air quotes. And that stayed with me both metaphorically and practically. The week PayPal went public, I was suddenly wealthy and tried to buy a new car, which was my first new car, only find out that my credit rating was so poor that the dealer who had read the article about PayPal going public and recognized my name said no matter how great it is to be you, you're going to pay cash because your credit score is awful. And right in front of my then-girlfriend now-wife she's always you see, she met me before all of this began, and so I think she already knew I was a complicated man when it comes to credit anyway. And so the punchline is that I filed it under, hmm, it's interesting. Reality does not correspond to credit scores very well does it?And because the PayPal crew keeps in touch. I spend a lot of time hanging out with one of my earliest earliest PayPal co-conspirators whose name doesn't frequently get mentioned, but he's another one of these just utterly brilliant people that I met as early as high school, names Nathan Geddings. He went on to found Palantir Technologies. He's just a really, really, really high IQ person. He and I worked on fraud and credit underwriting for PayPal. And we're having lunch as we did a lot back in those days and he posed the question, why hadn't PayPal tried to build the better credit score? And the memory of being declined for the silly car purchase. Having my card but one of the sort of, it's interesting, but one of the burnt in my memory moments in my life was I turned 35 or 36, and went to a really fancy dinner that I tried to pay for with my credit card. One of my friends conspired to help the waitperson pretend that the card was declined. He meant no harm. I remember turning purple with embarrassment. And in that moment I said, Nathan, you're right. We should have fixed the bleep credit score and the origin story of Affirm starts there. So you know what, I'm going to do something about this.Murray: So you started Affirm to do that. But what's happened in recent years is you've really latched on to what became something of a craze, which is the buy now pay later movement. How did you get from credit scores to buy now pay later?Levchin: So sure enough, we build the credit score. Nathan is brilliant so he helped me build a pretty good score. And we went around the proverbial High Street offering it to various banks and other people that do lending. Every one of them told us if you are so smart, why don't you lend your own money? And at some point we said, you know what? You're right. We're going to have to prove that our credit underwriting is better than what's out there.So we then sat down and said well, neither one of us knows anything about marketing. So we're not really going to go out there and stand on the proverbial street corner and offer anybody loans. But we have to find demand from borrowers somehow. And I had long sort of been fascinated by this thing called bill me later, which before BNPL had a name and an acronym and was the hot craze. It was this really interesting company called Bill Me Later, that was acquired by PayPal, of all things, in sort of the heat of the 2008 financial collapse.But the idea was pretty similar. It was this notion that you borrow money specifically for the purchase. And that of course was mimicking a long existing idea called a point of sale-issued credit card, when you would walk into a Macy's or a department store somebody woud say hey, you want 10% off your cart or your dress or your slacks. You can get this credit card with a store name on it, and we'll give you a special discount. And when you come back to the store again, you'll use this card again and we'll create loyalty that way. I  said that's probably a really good hack because we won't have to market, the merchants will market the product for us. We would just deal with the credit underwriting and facilitating the loan. The more I looked, of course Bill Me Later was no more, it became PayPal Credit, but the point of sale credit cards were still very much a thing. It turned out to be the fastest growing segment of credit cards. The more I looked into that segment, the more I realized that it was one of the schlockiest products. and that's a technical term, ever offered.Murray: Define schlocky. I think I know what you mean, but go ahead. You tell us why it was bad.Levchin: So a great rule of thumb is that if it says in giant print ""free"" or ""0%,"" you'll find an asterisk immediately after and in very small print it says but if you don't make exactly the right number of pennies and dollars in exactly the right schedule for the following 96 months. If on the last day and the last hour, you're a penny short, all the interest that could have compounded going back six years, whatever will have been due. So it's known technically as a deferred interest loan or a deferred interest line of credit. And in the very small print which is the business model, it says that we'll give it to you for free, no interest at all. However, if any of the many rules gets breached, it'll be interest due and it flows back from the very beginning from the purchase time and that is how that particular industry makes money.And so from, hey, I have a cool marketing hack to this is an enragingly bad product for consumers, we built what became BNPL. Which is in Affirm's case, not just no deferred interest, which is true evil in my professional opinion, but also no late fees, no compounding interest, interest that's actually fixed so consumers will know exactly how many dollars and cents they will ever owe us. We really build the company around this idea that we will do the right thing for the consumer, and especially if they are down on their luck, we will not make money from it. We will actually help them deal with their financial difficulties. [inaudible] Certainly we're not the only company that built this buy now pay later craze, as you put it, but I'd like to believe that we ushered the change of financial services that really are for the people as opposed to against them.McGirt: The work that you're describing has the potential to impact all kinds of people who have been underserved by the banking industry in all ways that we know including payday lenders, and just the shlocky mechanics that you just described. You also described a person like yourself who is vulnerable to these kinds of things. How else have you learned to get to know the different kinds of customers who are vulnerable? I say that as someone who doesn't get the chance to profile really smart technologies, leaders and founders so much anymore, but I spend a lot of time thinking about the racial wealth gap. I spend a lot of time thinking about inclusion and exclusion by design? How have you learned to get to know the various subsets of individuals who have been harmed by the financial services industry?Levchin: Couple of things. There's no substitute for talking to the people. So in the earliest days, and now it's advice for every CEO and every product-minded CEO, which I certainly count myself among, get on the phone and answer customer service calls. And in the world of lending it's a lot more personal, if you will, that by which if it doesn't work, what are you going to do about it? It's the I have to declare personal bankruptcy, and I still owe you money. And the only answer, of course, is go deal with that. That's it. We're going to step very far out of your life and we're going to see you come back from the financial brink that you're in. Fortunately it's not a super common thing in our world, but things like hey, I lost my job. I used to do this basically to just give myself a boost emotionally, back in the day, not as much these days, but I would listen in the calls where somebody would call in who didn't understand that we did not have late fees. So the conversation goes like this: Okay, so I'm a couple days behind. Was totally not my fault. My dog ate my homework. Here's the thing, I already made my payments. Can I talk to you about the late fee that you guys charge? But we don't charge late fees. What what? We don't charge late fees. Oh my god, you guys are amazing. I'll tell all my friends. Every time I hear that [I think] this is so awesome. So I used to do that a lot.Not all the conversations are quite that cheerful and you'll learn a lot about people's lives. And during COVID, and since the pandemic began, I tried to learn a lot about where people were losing their jobs and what did it look like and do they have savings, how are they behaving? And I spent a lot of time doing that and still do. One other thing I did which was really educational and, I think at the time, vaguely controversial but not so much anymore. I think  in 2015, I think, I joined the advisory board of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That's the all-feared all-important CFPB and it was fascinating in the sense that you get to be in the room where debates rage about sort of what's good and what's bad for consumers, not just by practitioners in the industry, but also the regulators. You get a lot of really interesting points of view that way. They were unbelievably willing to share how they think about regulating the industries that they're responsible for regulating and how they think about bad actors, good actors. I had a wonderful conversation with a lawyer there and basically repeated the no we don't charge late fees. She was sort of really? That's one of one. That was very educational. The most interesting part of the CFPB experience was you get to encounter consumer advocacy groups that represent all sorts of folks from all sorts of walks of life, everything from indigenous people to folks that were affected by a hurricane. So you just get these really, sometimes, devastating perspectives from people that you would not have related to otherwise.[Music]Murray: I'm here with Joe Ucuzoglu, the CEO of Deloitte US, and the sponsor of this podcast for all three of its seasons. Thank you for that, Joe.Joe Ucuzoglu: Pleasure to be here, Alan.Murray: Joe, business is facing so many challenges these days. The continued pandemic the battle for talent, supply chain problems, rising inflation and now, on top of all that, the war in Europe. How are companies responding to all this disruption?Ucuzoglu: Alan, you're seeing a remarkable level of optimism in the face of so many varied challenges. And by and large, I attribute that to a recognition that this is just the new normal, the constant curveballs that will be thrown at us, but at the same time given how successfully so many of these organizations have navigated through these things over the past couple of years, a growing confidence that we'll be able to continue to navigate the issues that get thrown at us and grow our businesses. But to do that we are absolutely seeing a new brand of leadership emerge, grounded in resilience, in agility, in a learning mindset. These are the most important leadership attributes in an environment where we should just expect that change and disruption are going to be at a consistently high level of intensity.Murray: The problems aren't going away, Joe, right? You have to manage through them.Ucuzoglu: I had a CEO say to me recently that if you put together a list of the top 20 risks one week, something big is going to hit the next week and it probably isn't even on that list. That's just a reflection of the number of different phenomena in the world right now. And the level of complexity that businesses are managing through.Murray: Joe, thank you.Ucuzoglu: Alan, it's a real pleasure.[Music]Murray: So Max, let's talk about the roller coaster ride you've been on for the last two years. Affirm successfully did an IPO in January of 2021. Very good timing on your part. Congratulations. You raised over a billion dollars. The thing popped. It kind of doubled in value the first day. You were on a great ride. It was a craze, as you said, very popular. And then this year you've seen almost a 90% decline in your stock price and market value. So what's going on there?Levchin: I think I'm in pretty good company if you look at the cohort that went public around the time that we did or the rest of the tech market or the rest of the market these days.Murray: I don't know. Ninety percent may put you at the head of the pack.Levchin: I think can probably name a few more that are right there with me.Murray: Feel free.Levchin: There's no need to, it's not exactly something that any CEO is excited about. The good news is that ultimately, I care about the stock price, I think it's a very important thing for me to let my shareholders know should they be listening, That said I care about it, and I'd like to be graded in increments of we're not in [inaudible] anymore, but the five year plan makes a lot of sense and we're trying to build something for a long time. The daily fluctuations of AFRM would just make one's stomach get into one's throat just because it's such a volatile time in the market.And so as far as I can I try to look at our results of the company and expect the stock price to catch up to them. If you look at the results that we've posted, we've done extraordinarily well as a company between the day of our IPO and now, every metric that we publish has improved dramatically. So 90% down today and, perhaps, up or down tomorrow doesn't really change what we're building and how we're going about building it. We've made a public commitment to the markets that we will get profitable in roughly at the beginning of the next fiscal year. That's the plant and that's what we'll execute on.Murray: Let's stick with that for a second because part of what the market seems to be saying, obviously, Mr. Market is not always right, but what the market seems to be saying is, yeah, this was a popular thing and it was good for the consumers and you were growing like mad. But in an era of sharply higher interest rates, it's not at all clear that you can make money. So why is the market wrong? Why is its perception of your future different from yours?Levchin: I think the markets will be proven wrong when we declare profitability, and I intend to do so on the schedule that we promised. So I think that's the best way I can prove the market wrong is by simply saying, Alright, see, I made a promise to do X and that's what we did and that's what we'll keep doing. Structurally, the reason we can make money is the unit economics of Affirm, not necessarily true for the rest of the industry, but for us it has been true for a very long time, every transaction, every loan we underwrite has positive unit economics, which means that at the end, including things like losses for credits and all the other things in costs, we call it RLTC revenue loss, transaction cost, contribution margin or any other sort of margin metric, our margins are strongly positive. That means that so long as we keep growing so long as we make more transactions happen and people are still buying a number of things and Affirm is still growing a lot faster than the industry around us is, we will eventually make money because every transaction does create a positive margin.So so long as we were prudent at managing risk. Obviously, there's way to get it wrong, for example, if we are not tracking risk very carefully, you can start making negative transactions. That doesn't bode well for lenders. You can also do lots of other irresponsible things, but we have run this company for 11 years in a very very responsible way. And for a long time—by the way the narrative two years ago three years ago, when we were competing in the world of zero interest rates and irresponsible spending by competitors, to put it bluntly, the conversation wasn't can you make money? It was are you guys growing as quickly as possible? Who cares about the fact that you are promising, we kept on saying the same things then…Murray: The good old days! We don’t care if you make money.Levchin: I don't think they’re the good old days at all. I don't believe in building irresponsible businesses. I think the idea of a business is to create profit in a responsible way. Ideally, be driver of responsible financial behavior for all our economic stakeholders, consumers, merchants, shareholders. So we've always done exactly the same thing, except today, the rest of competition is finding out it's really hard to make profitable transactions if you're not used to it. We're not. We always have done that.McGirt: And that leads me to, I guess, maybe it's probably a two part question. But the question is…how do you think about innovation? Clearly you’re mission driven. You've got purpose at the center of what you're doing. And you’ve set some very clear stakes in the ground around how you're going to behave with consumers. I'm sure that's inspiring for your employees. So I'm curious as you look out on the risk assessment dashboard,on some of the big picture issues like global inflation, food insecurity, the smoldering crises of war refugees and climate change, and you think about what's possible, how do you create an organization that thinks about inventing what's next, given the purpose that's at the core and the kinds of problems that we have in the world?Levchin: I could spend an hour just on all these things. It is a privilege but also a great blessing to lead a company with a mission at the center. I think when, in the good old days sense, you go public and everything looks peaches and cream, maybe people don't care so much about why they’re doing what they're doing because it’s rewarding and fun and everything's okay. When you're looking at a super high volatility stock market and read the news as we do with the interest rates going up and inflation raging, and a war in my hometown and on and on and on, it's a lot easier to motivate yourself, when you realize what you're doing actually helps real people in a way that's not just profitable, but also has a ton of purpose behind it. And so that has been a great backbone with which I get to lead the company. My management team gets to do the same. The way we try to innovate…again, nothing is better for innovators than constraints. If you tell yourself here's a blank sheet of paper, at least in my case, you don’t know where to start. There's so much opportunity. It’s beautiful without anything on it. Maybe I'll wait.If you tell yourself no, we will never charge late fees. No, we'll never touch deferred interest with 10-foot pole because it is truly terrible. All these things that we said these are not good for consumers. These are bad things. We're going to avoid them. And yet people still need to buy things and in the world of today, they actually need our help more than ever. Inflation strips away your ability to buy the things you need. And if it's a suit to look good, and your next job interview as U.S. rolls back from full employment, that's going to be a relevant thing. If you're not employed and you still need to look presentable for that interview, the only way you're going to pay for it is with a pay over time scheme of some kind and if I can help you not fall into the trap that is revolving credit e.g. credit card, that's part of the mission. So I think these constraints actually drive us to invent new things.By the way, the other constituent that we have are the merchants. They are just important to us and our job there is to help them bring what's on their shelves into the hands of the willing buyer. We create more velocity of sales for them. And again, we're doing it in a responsible way where they know the consumer isn't going to wake up one morning and say oh my god, I bought that suit at place x and boy do I feel screwed because the interest has now overrun my life. And so we are [inaudible] to the brand of the merchant because we treat they’re, our shared consumer right, and we help consumers stay on the right side of their financial decisions. There's always more ideas. The thing about about payments and credit and financial services. We're not just trying to help you buy things. Fundamentally the mission of Affirm expressed as a product strategy is we're helping your money go further. That's really what we're trying to do.Murray: Yeah, so that's the question I want to ask. Clearly a strong sense of purpose behind Affirm. If it's such a good idea, and I certainly think it's a good idea, you know, be totally transparent. We're not going to have deferred interest. We're not going to have hidden fees. We're not going to have late fees. If it's such a good idea, why aren't you driving all the credit cards out of the market?Levchin: We’re making a dent and, just so I’m clear, we’re trying. But this isn’t a great secret….McGirt: That’s the 10-year plan.Levchin: If we’re being for honestly, it's like a 30-year plan. I intend to make it, but I think we are doing our best to provide a viable alternative. And just to use our super brief history of Affirm's product roadmap, so we started with this idea that you're going to buy a bicycle, you're going to buy a couch, things that are expensive. Looking back at the 20-year-old Max, what do I need this credit card thing for? I have a dorm room and it's empty. And so we built what we call installment payment planner. It's got a lot of names now but it’s the pay over time over many, many months, from six to 36 to replace credit cards for considered purchases, bicycles or couches. Then we realized that it even works for $200 things or $150 things. So more like a nice presentable dress or suit. So that's what now colloquially known as the BNPL, paid for over six weeks. And then we realized that there's still a lot of other things you buy that does not fit into either of those other two things that we launched, we just really started rolling it out, our answer to a debit card, we’re calling it debit plus, or you can think of it as credit minus. It's basically a credit card minus the late fees minus deferred interest minus all the schlock. So we are absolutely chasing the credit card volume, which is on the order of a trillion dollars. So there's a long way to go.Murray: Well, we're going to have you back in 30 years to talk about that. But Ellen, we should talk a little bit about what's happening in Ukraine. This is your home country. How do you make sense of this moment in world history?Levchin: I don’t know if I can. I'm no geo. So I read the same newspapers all of us do and I listen to the commentators and absorb the knowledge but I don't think I have much to add to the conversation around where it came from. Which side of the responsibility gets placed where. The humanitarian crisis is very real and it hits me perhaps slightly more than the average because I have relatives in both the places, some where there's no daily shooting and some where there are. So I think that's that's probably the most honest answer. The whole thing is terrible and I hope it’s peaceful eventually.McGirt: We're so sorry to hear that. Just as a follow up, I remember the last time I saw you many years ago, we were having a reporting lunch, and you told me story. Both our parents, your father and my mother in their retirement had started writing poetry. And we both learned the hard way that when they shared their poetry that they were not asking for actual feedback. They just wanted to hear that it was wonderful, and it was such a delightful shared moment. And then you talked a little bit about your dad, who was a pretty big deal in Ukraine. The story of your family's escape and your statelessness. And the obviously the wonderful, happy ending for you in the United States feels like it's playing out around the world, but particularly in that part of the world, in a very terrifying way. Could you tell us a little bit about that experience with the eye to giving us a little bit more insight into what it's like for other people now.Levchin: Excellent memory. I have to comment on that. I think since we last saw each other in person, my dad, very sadly, passed away.McGirt: I’m so sorry to hear that.Levchin: Thank you. But he was a wonderful guy and a gentle man and a gentleman. He taught me a lot. The long and short of my experience was we got exceedingly lucky. I think the reality of Ukraine today via almost seven, almost 8 million people that escaped. I got nothing on them. We left the country by plane. The scariest part of my journey out was a really rough border guard told us in no uncertain terms that we're traitors and we’ll never be allowed back and all sorts of scary sounding things, took away my floppy disks which had my entire software collection on them, but that's really other than the sense of hope we lost very little else. I think people who are running away from the war today are literally traveling with a suitcase and a half and a kid on their shoulder. So that's, that's a little bit different. I feel enormous gratitude for the U.S. receiving us, but also an extraordinary sense of luck. Fast forward 30 years and you have what you have today.Murray: Max Levchin from the days of PayPal we won't use the M word, through Yelp, Evernote, Yahoo, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and now to Affirm, you've had just an amazing career. And you have a huge ambition for the next 30 years. And we're going to mark our calendars and have you back to talk about the end of credit cards when that period is over. But thank you so much for spending the time with Ellen and Me on Leadership Next.Levchin: Thank you. Thank you for having me.

After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put International Business Machines Corporation IBM stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, International Business Machines has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.79, as you can see in the chart below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis level actually compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&amp;P 500 stands at about 17.32. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, International Business Machines’ current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.12. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe should also point out that International Business Machines has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 15.17, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for International Business Machines stock in the near term too.Story continuesP/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, International Business Machines has a P/S ratio of about 2.09. This is lower than the S&amp;P 500 average, which comes in at 3.48 right now. As we can see in the chart below, this is above the median for this stock in particular over the past few years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIBM is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, International Business Machines currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes International Business Machines a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 9.12, which is better than the industry average of 11.03. Clearly, IBM is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though International Business Machines might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of F. This gives IBM a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here &gt;&gt;)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen zero estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower, while the full year estimate has seen no upward and seven downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 6.1% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has declined 3.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:International Business Machines Corporation Price and ConsensusInternational Business Machines Corporation Price and ConsensusInternational Business Machines Corporation price-consensus-chart | International Business Machines Corporation QuoteThis negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineInternational Business Machines is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among the bottom 27%) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past three years, the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Big Blue has invested millions in the field, and is unveiling a new quantum processor this week that is more than three times more powerful, measured by qubits, than its version announced last year.In October, US President Joe Biden toured IBM’s quantum data center in Poughkeepsie, New York, saying the technology is “vital to our economy and equally important to our national security.” National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in September that quantum and other emerging technologies will have “an outsized importance over the coming decade,” adding that export controls could be used to maintain US advantages in the area.Story continuesIBM under Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna has been increasingly acquisitive, buying companies like Red Hat to bolster the company’s offerings in artificial intelligence. IBM has also invested in quantum startups such as Quantinuum, and future acquisitions in the industry are possible, Gil said.The first real-world applications for quantum computing will likely be in the industrials sector -- such as advanced simulations to develop a corrosion-resistant airplane wing -- or in financial modeling, Gil said, noting that banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are part of IBM’s network of partners. Quantum systems could be used in business within the decade, while the first demonstrations of superiority to traditional computers could happen within a “couple years,” Gil said.Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Intel Corp. are among the other companies devoting millions of research dollars to various quantum projects.--With assistance from Ian King.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAmericans Have $5 Trillion in Cash, Thanks to Federal StimulusThe Golden Era of AI Chess Makes Things Tricky for PlayersOne of Gaming’s Most Hated Execs Is Jumping Into the MetaverseHow Apple Stores Became Just Another Retail JobMeta Investors Are in No Mood for Zuckerberg’s Metaverse Moonshot©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

ADM, HF Sinclair Corp, DINO, LPL Financial Holdings Inc. LPLA, Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC and Halliburton Co. HAL.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Must-Buy High-Flying Stocks of 2022Wall Street has experienced a disappointing 2022 so far. U.S. stock markets saw astonishing growth in the coronavirus-ridden last two years owing to unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli and ultra-dovish monetary policies adopted by the Fed.However, the complete devastation of the global supply-chain system, the shortage of labor, the lingering war between Russia and Ukraine and a zero-tolerance approach to COVD-19 infection taken by China resulted in global inflation, especially record-high inflation in the United States.Global financial markets have been rattled by the Fed’s highly aggressive monetary stance to combat 40-year high inflation. The interest rate has already jumped 3.75% this year with more hikes underway. Yields on U.S. sovereign bonds have skyrocketed and the dollar price index reached a two-decade high.Consequently, year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have plummeted 8.7%, 19.7% and 32.1%, respectively. Despite these severe headwinds several large-cap stocks are flying high in 2022. Investment in these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should provide solid returns in the near term.A Relief RallyU.S. stock markets have been witnessing an impressive rally since the beginning of October. We are not out of the woods as inflation remains elevated. In the post-FOMC meeting statement in November, the Fed Chairman clearly indicated that the terminal interest rate this rate-hiking cycle would be higher than 5%.Story continuesYet, markets continue to rally on the assumption that the Fed may lower the magnitude of rate hike from the December FOMC meeting. A series of recently released economic data has also suggested that the central bank’s ultra-hawkish monetary policies have started giving the needed results, albeit at a slow pace.The U.S. stock market momentum is likely to continue in November as the country’s GDP grew 2.6% in the third quarter, beating the consensus estimate of 2.2%. Market participants were worried that the economy might enter a recession after it contracted in the first two quarters of this year.In third-quarter 2022, the chain-weighted price index — a cost-of-living index adjusted for consumer behavior — rose 4.1%, well below the consensus estimate of a 5.3%. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index increased 4.2%, exhibiting a sharp fall from 7.3% in the second quarter. The core (excluding the volatile food and energy items) PCE price index — Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — rose 4.5% in the third quarter, in line with the market’s expectation.Out Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) stocks that have popped year to date with solid upside left for the rest of 2022.

184,c01055b6-fa20-3a41-801c-40abe2dfd5c6,MPC,2022-11-10,"Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) Looks Interesting, And It's About To Pay A Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-petroleum-corporation-nyse-mpc-100455728.html,1668074695,STORY,['MPC'],"[Readers hoping to buy Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, Marathon Petroleum investors that purchase the stock on or after the 15th of November will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of December.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.75 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.00 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Marathon Petroleum has a trailing yield of approximately 2.6% on its current stock price of $115.86. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Marathon Petroleum has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 11% of its income after tax. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out 9.5% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservatively low.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's comforting to see Marathon Petroleum's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 63% per annum for the past five years. With earnings per share growing rapidly and the company sensibly reinvesting almost all of its profits within the business, Marathon Petroleum looks like a promising growth company.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Marathon Petroleum has lifted its dividend by approximately 20% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.Final TakeawayShould investors buy Marathon Petroleum for the upcoming dividend? Marathon Petroleum has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. Marathon Petroleum looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.While it's tempting to invest in Marathon Petroleum for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Marathon Petroleum (1 shouldn't be ignored) you should be aware of.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

185,3d3f24a2-cae0-3141-9ae9-79db34bbf75c,MPC,2022-11-10,Investing Whiz Bob Doll Says These High-Quality Energy Stocks Can Thrive in a Volatile Market,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-whiz-bob-doll-says-234756633.html,1668037676,STORY,"['XOM', 'MPC']","[A look at the year-to-date charts of the major stock market indexes shows that the bearish trend has been choppy. It’s been marked by short rallies that sputter out until the pattern repeats. This makes a confusing environment for investors.And we're not out of the woods yet, says former BlackRock stock chief and Crossmark CIO Bob Doll. In his view, the markets are going to get worse in the short term, perhaps retesting the recent lows near 3,500. Doll notes that the Federal Reserve has “only” raised interest rates to the 3.75% to 4% range, and that this is likely not enough curb inflation.With this in mind, the task for investors is to find stocks that are going to win going forward, no matter how the market moves, and Doll has a bit of advice there, too.“I don't think you have to roll the dice and take on a lot of risk in the portfolio. Good solid companies that are selling at reasonable prices; or they have good cash flow... those are the kinds of things that I'm trying to focus on... Energy companies make a bunch of money... They're being very disciplined this time, which is great for financial returns and for investors,"" Doll opined.In particular, Doll has recommended two high-quality energy stocks that have proven they can thrive on volatility. We’ve delved into TipRanks' database to see what Wall Street analysts have to say about whether these stocks make compelling investments. Let's take a closer look.Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC)We'll start with Marathon Petroleum, an old name in the oil industry and currently the largest producer of refined petroleum products in the North American market. The company boasts a $54 billion market cap and stock that has gained 85% year-to-date, far outperforming the broader markets. Marathon strength rests on its operations: 13 active refineries, operating in 12 states, with a combined capacity of 2.9 million barrels of crude oil daily.A continent-spanning operation, in an essential industry, brought Marathon $47.2 billion in revenues in the recently reported 3Q22, a 45% increase from the same period last year. The company reported an adjusted net income of $3.9 billion, or $7.81 per diluted share. The EPS number was up from just 73 cents in 3Q21.Story continuesSo the company is profitable, and showing strong share appreciation in a difficult environment. Also of note for investors, Marathon Petroleum also declared a Q4 dividend, to be paid on December 12, of 75 cents per common share. This is a 30% increase quarter-over-quarter, and on an annualized basis, the new dividend comes to $3 per common share. At that rate, it yields 2.6%, a bit over the average for companies listed in the S&amp;P 500. Marathon has been keeping reliable dividend payments for the past 11 years.All of this has impressed Raymond James’ 5-star analyst Justin Jenkins, who writes of MPC: “We believe the relative momentum will roll on as the refining macro is still supportive of well above midcycle margins (and record October cracks too). While MPC has executed on its capital allocation and shareholder return goals, excellent operations, a supportive refining macro, and continued emphasis on returns by managements forces MPC to be our top refining pick even after dramatic outperformance over roughly the past two years...""To this end, Jenkins rates MPC stock a Strong Buy, and his price target of $150 suggests it has a 29% upside potential for the coming year. (To watch Jenkins’ track record, click here)Wall Street is definitely down with the bulls on these shares. The stock has 13 recent analyst reviews, and they break down to 10 Buys over 3 Holds for a Strong Buy consensus rating. (See MPC stock forecast on TipRanks)ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM)The second energy stock pick on Doll’s list is ExxonMobil, one of the world’s largest crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. ExxonMobil has its fingers in many pots, from hydrocarbon exploration on the global scene to the US refined product market to the development of new energy sources and more efficient fuels to power a low-carbon or net-zero future.It takes a big company and a deep purse to manage all of that. ExxonMobil, with its $448 billion market cap, fits the bill. The company keeps up its size with outsized quarterly results – it showed a top line exceeding $112 billion in the recently reported 3Q22, up 52% year-over-year. For the first nine months of this year, ExxonMobil has generated $318 billion in revenues, compared to $200 billion for the same period in 2021.On earnings, the company realized $19.7 billion in the recent third quarter. This came to $4.68 per diluted share, compared to $1.58 EPS in the year-ago quarter. The company’s cash flow expanded in Q3, by $11.6 billion, and the free cash flow, which helps to support the dividend payment, came in at $22 billion.The dividend is worth mentioning. ExxonMobil declared a 91-cent per commons share payment for Q4, up 3 cents from the previous quarter, and payable on December 9. With the annualized rate coming to $3.64 per common share, the dividend yields a 3.2%, well above average. XOM has been keeping reliable payments for 14 years.Along with increasing top and bottom lines, ExxonMobil's shares have been gaining all year. The stock is up an impressive 84% year-to-date, outperforming the broader markets by a wide margin.Covering the stock for Jefferies, 5-star analyst Lloyd Byrne thinks this name could see even more gains ahead.""We believe Exxon has created a compelling investment case... XOM is 'on the front foot' and we see attractive risk/reward, particularly for generalists needing energy exposure... We see Exxon's financial position as solid, as the company rationalized cost structure, and used the higher oil &amp; gas environment to repair its balance sheet. At the same time, XOM continued to reinvest in longer term projects across the energy chain,"" Byrne opined.""With strong financials and an industry leading upstream and downstream portfolio, we believe Exxonis positioned to outperform over the medium-term,"" the analyst summed up.All of this, in Byrne’s view, justifies a Buy rating, along with a $133 price target. Should the target be met, a twelve-month gain of ~22% could be in store. (To watch Byrne’s track record, click here)All in all, XOM shares have gotten the nod from 12 analysts, who collectively give the stock an 8 to 4 advantage in Buys over Holds for a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category.

MPC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as an A grade for Value.MPC is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.35. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. MPC's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.68. Within the past year, MPC's PEG has been as high as 1.53 and as low as 0.25, with a median of 0.58.Investors should also recognize that MPC has a P/B ratio of 1.71.

Over the past 12 months, MPC's P/B has been as high as 2.03 and as low as 1.06, with a median of 1.48.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales.

This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.33.Story continuesFinally, we should also recognize that MPC has a P/CF ratio of 3.87. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. MPC's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 5.22. Within the past 12 months, MPC's P/CF has been as high as 4.93 and as low as 2.96, with a median of 3.61.PBF Energy (PBF) may be another strong Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing stock to add to your shortlist.

In the first quarter of 2022, EV sales came to 2 million, a 75% increase compared to the first three months of 2021,” said CNBC contributor Anmar Frangoul.Ford (NYSE:F) just said EV sales were up about 197% year over year thanks to Mustang Mach-E growth. BMW (OTC:BMWYY) electric vehicle sales were up about 115% year over year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading Tips“To build on its success, BMW is launching its first electric seven series, the BMW I7, in November, and the I5 will follow in 2023. In addition, the BMW Group unveiled the fully electric Rolls Royce Spectre in October, also set to release next year,” according to Electrek.co.From here, numbers are only set to skyrocket, with global leaders wanting millions of EVs on the roads. For example, President Biden wants half of all new auto sales to be electric. We’re also now seeing a massive push to replace older school buses with electric models.As demand accelerates, here are seven top EV stocks to trade during the boom.TSLATesla$207.47LEVLion Electric$4.28ALBAlbemarle$284.99DRIVGlobal X Autonomous &amp; EV ETF$21.41IDRViShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF$35.88NIONio$11.68GMGeneral Motors$39.00Tesla (TSLA)Tesla (TSLA stock) Motors store in Piazza Gae Aulenti square in Milan, ItalySource: Zigres / Shutterstock.comTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) appears to have gotten hit by a bus. Since September, the stock fell from about $310 to $200. All thanks to earnings that fell short of expectations.For example, Tesla reported 343,000 total deliveries, which was below estimates for 364,660. Two, there were concerns Elon Musk’s involvement with Twitter would take away from his focus. However, this is Tesla one of the top EV stocks out there. The pullback is temporary, and it still commands a significant market share.Story continuesIn addition, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives just said, “We view this more of a logistical speed bump rather than the start of a softer delivery trajectory into the [fourth quarter and 2023] and remain bullish on the Tesla story,” he said, as quoted by Barron’s.Lion Electric (LEV)An electric vehicle charger is seen next to a row of blue electric buses.Source: BigPixel Photo / Shutterstock.comOver the last few weeks, Lion Electric (NYSE:LEV) rallied from a low of about $2 to $4.28 on the news it’s rolling our zero-emission EV school buses.That’s a big deal, especially after The White House announced a $1 billion award to U.S. school districts to replace older buses with electric models.According to The White House, “The awards will go to school districts in all 50 states and Washington D.C., in addition to several U.S. territories and institutions serving federally recognized Tribes. The new awards will support the purchase of 2,463 buses, and 95% of these buses will be electric.”Even better for Lion Electric, only about 1% of all school buses are all-electric as of 2021. As that ramps higher, Lion Electric could see a “lion’s share” of those investments.Even earnings have been solid. In its second quarter, the company delivered 105 vehicles, as compared to 61 year-over-year. Revenue of $29.5 million, was up nicely from $16.7 million year over year. Net earnings came in at $37.5 million, as compared to a net loss of $178.5 million year over year, as well making this one of the EV stocks to definitely keep your eyes on.Albemarle (ALB)lithium (LI) on the periodic tableSource: ShutterstockWhen it comes to EV stocks, it’s impossible to leave out lithium and related stocks, like Albemarle (NYSE:ALB). After all, lithium is one of the world’s most essential materials these days. Without it, there is no EV boom. There’s no green boom either.With a severe supply-demand issue, lithium prices will soar. Automakers are scrambling for supply. Firms such as Trafigura Group say lithium demand “will hit 800,000 tons of lithium carbonate equivalent this year — overshooting supply by 140,000 tons — and sees demand rising by a further 200,000 to 250,000 tons annually through 2025,” as quoted by Mining.com.That’s a goldmine opportunity for $32 billion Albemarle, which is developing lithium projects all over the world, including the U.S., Chile, Brazil, Germany, China, Japan, Taiwan and Australia.Better, earnings and growth are off the charts for ALB. All thanks to lithium.The company posted a net income of $897.2 million, or $7.61 per share. That’s comparable to a year-earlier net loss of $392.8 million, or $3.36 a share.If we exclude one-time items, the company earned $7.50 a share, which still beat expectations for $6.99. Sales were up 152% to $2.09 billion, which was lower than estimates for $2.25 billion. For the full year, Albemarle raised the bottom end of its profit forecast to $3.3 billion from $3.2 billion.Global X Autonomous &amp; Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV)Photo of charging port on electric vehicle (EV) plugged into and being chargedSource: shutterstock.com/Nixx PhotographyOne of the best ways to diversify among EV stocks at less cost is with an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, such as the Global X Autonomous &amp; Electric Vehicles ETF (NASDAQ:DRIV).With an expense ratio of 0.68%, this ETF invests in “companies involved in the development of autonomous vehicle technology, electric vehicles, and EV components and materials. This includes companies involved in the development of autonomous vehicle software and hardware, as well as companies that produce EVs, EV components such as lithium batteries, and critical EV materials such as lithium and cobalt,” as noted by Global X.While the DRIV ETF was beaten down to $20.03 in recent weeks, give it time. With an accelerating EV story, I’d like to see this ETF closer to $50 over the next two years.iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF (IDRV)an electric vehicle (EV) at a charging station representing EV stocksSource: Alexandru Nika / Shutterstock.comAnother ETF, the iShares Self-Driving EV and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:IDRV), has an expense ratio of 0.47% and invests in growth and innovation in and around EVs.According to iShares, this ETF offers access to companies at the forefront of self-driving and EV innovation as well as the battery technology space. It also offers exposure to global stocks within the full value chain of self-driving and EV industries.The IDRV ETF is another one badly beaten up. Again, though, with the EV boom racing, and global demand gaining speed, I’d also like to see IDRV closer to $50 over the next two years.Nio Inc. (NIO)Shanghai.China-Feb.2021: exterior of NIO store. A Chinese electric car brandSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.comNio (NYSE:NIO) dropped from $23 to less than $10 before bouncing back above $11.Tesla recently cut prices for its vehicles in China, which led investors to question just how strong EV demand is in the country.Chinese stocks were beaten up on news President Xi Jinping won a third term. There have also been issues regarding China’s zero COVID policy. October deliveries, while up 174.3% year over year, were down from September deliveries of 10,878.However, weakness may be a buying opportunity here. Not only has NIO become one of the most hated stocks on the market, but it also appears to have priced in a good deal of negativity.It’s also still expanding into the German, Dutch, Danish and Swedish EV markets. Also, as noted in its second-quarter earnings report, the company said it is “confident that our delivery targets for the whole year,” and that, “we are confident to achieve the record-breaking target for the fourth quarter, and we have been making active preparations to meet this target as well.”With NIO, I believe the crisis will lead to opportunity.General Motors (GM)Image of General Motors logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) has now captured more than 8% of U.S. electric vehicles sales, said CEO Mary Barra in a shareholder letter.In fact, she said the company, “earned more than 8% of the U.S. electric vehicle market in the third quarter thanks to record sales of the Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV.”Thanks to that strong demand, the CEO also said GM intends to increase production to a combined 70,000, up from about 44,000.Better, the company has been introducing newer models, including the Chevrolet Equinox EV, the GMC Sierra EV, the Chevrolet Silverado EV, and the Blazer EV. Plus, GM managed to post better-than-expected earnings. EPS of $2.25 beat estimates of $1.99. Sales were up 56% year over year to $41.9 billion.Again, with EV demand only accelerating, and GM capturing even more market share, the stock could easily see higher highs.On the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Ian Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayEarly Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air”It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.But, for UAL, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for UALHere's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in UALAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 250.7%, as eight estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, UAL currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much UAL could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Target's new larger-format stores optimize additional space and new design elements and at nearly 150,000 square feet, the locations are more than 20,000 square feet larger than the chain average. While the retailer will continue to open stores of all sizes, it will focus on this larger footprint in the next few years.

You Have Four Days Left,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/interested-targets-nyse-tgt-upcoming-101054710.html,1668075054,STORY,['TGT'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. In other words, investors can purchase Target's shares before the 15th of November in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 10th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.08 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$4.32 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Target has a trailing yield of 2.8% on the current stock price of $152.99. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Target Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Target paid out a comfortable 40% of its profit last year. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out an unsustainably high 401% of its free cash flow as dividends over the past 12 months, which is worrying. It's pretty hard to pay out more than you earn, so we wonder how Target intends to continue funding this dividend, or if it could be forced to cut the payment.Target paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough cash to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Target to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. For this reason, we're glad to see Target's earnings per share have risen 15% per annum over the last five years. Earnings have been growing at a decent rate, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Target has lifted its dividend by approximately 14% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Target for the upcoming dividend? We like that Target has been successfully growing its earnings per share at a nice rate and reinvesting most of its profits in the business. However, we note the high cashflow payout ratio with some concern. In summary, it's hard to get excited about Target from a dividend perspective.So while Target looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. For example - Target has 4 warning signs we think you should be aware of.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Walmart stock has held up better than the broader market and investors are hoping a strong third quarter could give WMT stock a boost into positive territory this year. Walmart’s report will also show if the company can fend off rising competition from Amazon AMZN and Target TGT during an economic crunch with the latter also reporting earnings next week. To combat the competition Walmart has strived to advance its e-commerce business along with its retail stores.The Basics Walmart is well known for its “rollback” prices, which is significant as consumers look to lower costs. However, Wall Street will be scoping the company’s bottom line to see if these exclusive discounts are beneficial to Walmart during the current economic environment with operating costs rising for most businesses.In addition to running its core supercenters along with Sam’s Clubs domestically, the company has expanded its international operations with a presence in Canada, Chile, China, India, Mexico, Africa, and Central America. Walmart has also made the push into healthcare launching Walmart Health in 2019 to continue diversifying its business which also includes a growing subscription service.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ3 Outlook The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WMT’s Q3 earnings is $1.31 per share, which would be a decline of -9% from Q3 2021. Sales for Q3 are expected to be up 5% at $147.41 billion. This may be a slight indication that operating costs are weighing down the company’s bottom line in a tougher overall economic environment.Earnings estimates are slightly up from $1.30 at the beginning of the quarter. Year over year, WMT earnings are also expected to decline -9% in fiscal 2023, but rise 11% in FY24 at $6.52 per share. Top line growth is expected, with sales projected to be up 5% in fiscal 2023 and another 3% in FY24 to $618.97 billion.Story continuesPerformance &amp; Valuation Year to date, WMT is only down -3% to outperform the S&amp;P 500’s -21% and roughly match the Retail-Supermarkets Market’s +1%. Over the last decade, WMT is up +156% when including its dividend to beat its Zacks Subindustry’s +148% but lag the benchmark. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWMT’s historical performance has been very respectable and investors are hoping this continues as the economic downturn is favorable for omnichannel players like Walmart that offer consumers options to cut back on expenses.Trading around $139 per share, WMT has a forward P/E of 24.4X. This is well above the industry average of 11.6X but Walmart has shown itself to be a leader. WMT does trade at a discount to its decade-high of 28.1X and slightly above the median of 18X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineGoing into its Q3 earnings WMT lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its Retail-Supermarkets Industry is in the top 38% of over 250 Zacks Industries. Walmart could use strong beats on both its top and bottom lines. This could be a catalyst for WMT stock and show the company can continue benefiting in the current market environment.Wall Street will be monitoring Walmart’s ability to manage rising operating costs as the company’s business model offers many of its products at a discount to its competitors through its “rollback” prices.Investors may be rewarded for holding the stock as the current economic downturn could shift more consumers to Walmart. Plus, WMT offers a solid 1.57% annual dividend yield at $2.24 per share and the Average Zacks Price Target suggests 7% upside from current levels.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Beauty Stocks To Buy Now. In times of economic downturns, the beauty industry remains resilient, as consumers still like to splurge on beauty and skincare regimen, even if it might be in moderation. In 2022, consistently high inflation has tampered with impulsive purchases of beauty and personal care products. In the 12 months to October 1, 2022, there was a 2.1% decline in the sale of face care products in the United States, although higher prices made up for the lower volume. Similarly in Europe, over one in five customers are forecasted to allocate less money to their make-up and skincare products in the near future, as per research from McKinsey. For huge beauty companies, having a diversified range of products at multiple price points has helped deal with the economic slowdown. In better economic times, premiumization in skincare and haircare has proven to be a consumer favorite, displaying superior growth. This is why firms like Unilever, whose prestige beauty segment posted double-digit growth in the third quarter of 2022, are experimenting with premium beauty products. Some of the best beauty stocks to consider in order to benefit from the defensive nature of the sector include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), and The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL). Our Methodology We selected the following beauty stocks based on growth fundamentals, positive analyst coverage, and strong market visibility. We have arranged the list according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm, tracked by Insider Monkey as of the second quarter of 2022.12 Best Beauty Stocks To Buy NowAfrica Studio/Shutterstock.comBest Beauty Stocks To Buy Now12.

(NASDAQ:ULTA), and The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), L'Oréal S.A. (OTC:LRLCY) is one of the most prominent beauty stocks to monitor. Here is what ClearBridge Investments International Growth ACWI ex-U.S. Strategy has to say about L’Oréal S.A. (OTC:LRLCY) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Economies in Asia, meanwhile, are taking the opposite approach on stimulus, with China lowering its reserve requirement ratio for banks to support flagging growth in the world’s second largest economy. Japan’s new government passed a large stimulus bill after its economy contracted in the third quarter. Despite these actions, sentiment remains decidedly negative in these regions.

(NYSE:SBH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SBH) is a Texas-based specialty retailer and distributor of professional beauty supplies. The company offers beauty products such as hair color, skin and nail care products, and styling tools for retail customers and salon professionals. It is one of the best beauty stocks to invest in. On October 21, Jefferies analyst Ashley Helgans took over coverage of Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SBH) with a Hold rating and a $13 price target, down from $15. The market for beauty brands is transforming rapidly, but so far beauty has withstood the shift from goods to services ""given its connection to socialization, occasions, and self-care regimens,"" said the analyst. Jefferies’ data suggests high-single digit percentage year-over-year sales across mass and prestige, with pricing responsible for the majority of the increase, the analyst contended.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 18 hedge funds held long positions in Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SBH) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 17 funds in the prior quarter. Bernard Horn’s Polaris Capital Management is a notable position holder in the company, with 2.8 million shares worth $34 million. 10.

Tom Russo’s Gardner Russo &amp; Gardner is the leading position holder in the company, with approximately 7 million shares valued at $319 million. Here is what Mayar Capital specifically said about Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“In 1895 the Lever brothers created a new brand of hand soap. Inspired by the growing demand for hygiene products, the Lifebuoy brand of soaps was launched to ‘make health infectious’. 128 years later the Lifebuoy brand continues as a leading soap brand – albeit without the coal tar-derived ingredients list. In fact, the market research firm Kantar ranked Lifebuoy as the global #3 most chosen FMCG brand in 2020, just below Coca-Cola (KO) and Colgate (CL) – an astonishing fact given the age of the brand. While the brand is largely absent from shelves here in the UK, it is a juggernaut in Asian markets, and is the #1 brand in India.There are two observations about the Lifebuoy story which tell us a lot about Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL), which is currently our largest holding in the Fund.The first is the enduring power of brands in the consumer goods market. According to Kantar’s list of most chosen brands, the top 20 global marques have an average age of 116 years, with over half being founded in the 19th century. Fashions come and go, but there is something special about low-cost consumable goods that advantages strong, time-worn brand names…” (Click here to view full text)9. e.l.f. Beauty, Inc.

(NYSE:ELF) ""is the exception to the norm in terms of declining unit volume demand that we're seeing across the beauty industry more broadly,"" noted the analyst.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 22 funds were bullish on e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 20 funds in the prior quarter. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies is the largest position holder in the company, with 1.18 million shares worth $36.5 million. 8. The Beauty Health Company (NASDAQ:SKIN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25The Beauty Health Company (NASDAQ:SKIN) is a California-based company that develops, manufactures, and markets aesthetic technologies and products worldwide. It is one of the elite beauty stocks to invest in. In Q3 2022, the company reported a revenue of $88.8 million, up 30.3% on a year-over-year basis and beating market estimates by $8.12 million. The Beauty Health Company (NASDAQ:SKIN) raised its fiscal 2022 net sales guidance and now expects net sales in the range of $360 million to $365 million, up from the prior outlook of $340 million to $350 million. The consensus revenue estimate is $349.72 million.On October 21, Jefferies analyst Ashley Helgans assumed coverage of The Beauty Health Company (NASDAQ:SKIN) with a Buy rating and an unchanged price target of $20, citing the resilience of the beauty sector. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, The Beauty Health Company (NASDAQ:SKIN) was part of 25 public stock portfolios at the end of June 2022, compared to 26 in the preceding quarter.

Shares outperformed in the third quarter following better-than-expected earnings results and the announcement of two new retail partnerships with Nordstrom and Ulta, where the company expects to sell an aesthetics device that customers can use in their home. We continue to be attracted to the company’s asset light, recurring revenue business model and see the company doubling its revenues organically over the next few years. We also believe that Beauty Health will boost shareholder value over time through accretive acquisitions.”7. Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY) is a New York-based company that manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells beauty products worldwide. The company markets its products under the Burberry, Calvin Klein, Cavalli, Chloe, Davidoff, Gucci, Hugo Boss, Kylie Jenner, Lacoste, Lancaster, Marc Jacobs, Miu Miu, SKKN BY KIM, and Tiffany &amp; Co. brands, among others.

Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 10.40 million shares worth $83.30 million. Here is what Meridian Funds specifically said about Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Similarly, Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY) benefited from the market’s rising appetite for more defensive names during the quarter. The beauty products Coty manufactures and distributes saw steady market share gains, especially as core customers expanded their work and leisure activities outside of the home. The company also operates a broad distribution network and holds a deep intellectual property portfolio across key categories within the cosmetic and fragrance industries. Additionally, Coty is building momentum around a business transformation that’s in the early innings but has already seen success in e-commerce and direct-to-consumer gains, as well as a rising presence in China.”6. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is a general merchandise retailer in the United States that sells beauty products through its Target Beauty segment. On October 18, Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe upgraded Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $185, up from $170. Amid a ""challenging macroeconomic backdrop,"" a ""subdued"" valuation and advancements in supply chain and inventory support a bullish call on Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), the analyst told investors in a research note. The analyst believes the second half of 2022 risk exists but noted that 2023 will possibly bring  improved margins. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is better positioned than the broader retail sector currently, added the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 46 hedge funds were bullish on Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 50 funds in the last quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 2.6 million shares worth $369.4 million. Like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), and The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), elite hedge funds are backing Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) as a potential play in the beauty sector. Here is what LRT Capital Management specifically said about Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operates retail stores that sell a variety of merchandise ranging from necessities such as food and hygiene products to discretionary products like children’s toys and electronics. The sale of this merchandise is done primarily through physical retail locations in all 50 US states. However, Target also sells its merchandise digitally through its online website which delivers merchandise to its customers in three ways: order pickup, drive up, and “Shipt”. The Target Corporation operates a single segment through 1,926 physical stores.Target is one of the largest US brick-and-mortar retailers and has successfully adapted to the competitive environment in the age of Amazon. As of 7/15/2022, TGT shares are down 36% for the year and down 44% since their all-time-high last year. The business is experiencing issues that are temporary in nature and we believe that the shares present an attractive opportunity at current prices. Target performed exceptionally well during the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath. Unfortunately, the company was recently caught flat footed, as consumer preferences shifted towards more spending on services (such as travel), at the expense of physical goods. As a result, the company found itself with an excess of inventory which will likely pressure margins in the next few quarters. Target is not alone in this predicament as many retailers such as Walmart and Best Buy have experienced similar issues over the last few months. The Covid-19 pandemic created enormous difficulties for retailers in forecasting demand and appropriate inventory levels. Clearing excess inventory will pressure margins in the short-term, and while this is a clear negative for the company, we do not believe it detracts from the long-term attractiveness of the business. Target shares are currently “on sale” due to increased uncertainty about near-term operating margins – this we believe is an opportunity.Weak consumer sentiment, a slowing economy, recession fears, along with a list of other problems have called Target’s margins and short-term profitability into question. Until the most recent earnings calls, Target and many other retailers were seeing record margins and consumer demand. This led to oversupplying of inventory with a now weaker consumer and that is temporarily damaging the operating metrics of Target and similar retailers. Target’s margins are among the highest in the retail industry, and although it will take a hit in the coming quarters the company’s operating margin will likely return to roughly 7% in the longer term…” (Click here to read the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Beauty Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:11 Best Bitcoin Stocks To BuyGoldman Sachs Dividend Stocks10 Undervalued European Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Best Beauty Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the sector and its performance this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. The sizzling inflation and continuous interest rate hikes have taken nearly every sector into its fold this year. However, the consumer staples sector is performing better than the rest of the market because these companies exhibit strong demand for their products even during weak economic conditions. The growing demand gives the sector hedging capabilities against inflation, which makes investors pick these stocks over other risky industries. Some of the well-known names in the consumer staples sector include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP).Consumer staples companies benefitted a lot during the pandemic due to increased consumer spending, especially through digital channels. According to a report by JPMorgan, e-commerce represented 12% of gross sales in the first six months of 2020 and showed a 60% growth from the prior-year period (see the biggest e-commerce companies). The shift in the companies’ way of running businesses has further expanded the sector as people now have access to various online systems. This year’s returns have also shown that shares of the consumer staple companies have trounced their counterparts. The S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples index declined by 6.22% year-to-date, compared with a 29.6% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology index. Another report by Fidelity Investments shows that the consumer staples sector delivered a 14% annualized return in the last three years ending March 2022, compared with an 11% and 13.2% return for the energy and industrial sectors.Due to their non-cyclic nature, consumer staples have stable earnings, consistent cash flows, and strong balance sheets, which are very important from a dividend perspective. In the current market, investors prefer safe stocks that would help them to stay afloat and generate stable income. For this reason, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks in the sector.Story continues13 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks to Buy NowCopyright: jetcityimage / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are from the consumer staples sector and pay dividends to shareholders. We analyzed these stocks through their dividend policies, balance sheets, and overall fundamentals. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yields as of November 8.13. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Dividend Yield as of November 8: 0.73%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American multinational big-box store company. In October, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $525 with an Overweight rating on the shares, appreciating the company's unit growth and market share gains.In fiscal Q4 2022, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) reported revenue of $72 billion, which showed a 15% growth from the same period last year. The company ended the quarter with over $10.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Its total current assets amounted to over $32.6 billion, compared with $29.5 billion in the prior-year quarter.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 18 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks in the consumer staples sector.

Here is what the firm has to say:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”12. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Dividend Yield as of November 8: 1.56%Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail company that operates a chain of hypermarkets and grocery stores.

Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”11.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)7.

205,3ee2048c-c31d-3e0f-8a64-a0290ae58a42,TGT,2022-11-10,Earnings Preview: Target (TGT) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-target-tgt-q3-150003881.html,1668006003,STORY,['TGT'],"[Target (TGT) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 16. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.14 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -29.4%.Revenues are expected to be $26.36 billion, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.38% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Target?For Target, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.34%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Target will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Target would post earnings of $0.71 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.39, delivering a surprise of -45.07%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Target doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Corrugated Packaging segment sales increased $182 million, or 8.3%; Consumer Packaging segment sales increased $147 million, or 12.7%; Distribution segment sales increased $26 million, or 7.4%; Global Paper segment sales decreased $33 million, or 2.3%; and intersegment sales increased $10 million.Net income increased $21 million year-over-year to $345 million. The impact of higher selling price/mix and ransomware insurance recoveries were nearly offset by increased cost inflation, lower volumes and higher operating costs. Net income was impacted by $37 million of insurance recoveries related to the fiscal 2021 ransomware incident: $31 million related to business interruption costs that were recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold and the balance related to ransomware recovery costs that were recorded as a reduction of selling, general and administrative excluding intangible amortization.Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA increased $42 million, or 4.8%, year-over-year, primarily in the Corrugated Packaging and Consumer Packaging segments. Ransomware insurance recoveries accounted for $26 million of the year-over-year increase in Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA.Additional information about the changes in segment sales and Adjusted EBITDA by segment are included below.Restructuring and Other CostsRestructuring and other costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 were $35 million. The charges were primarily related to the previously announced permanent closure of the corrugated medium manufacturing operations at the St. Paul, Minnesota mill, the previously announced closure of the Panama City, Florida mill and acquisition and divestiture costs.Cash Flow ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $540 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to $678 million in the prior year quarter primarily due to increased working capital.Total debt was $7.8 billion at September 30, 2022, $7.6 billion excluding $175 million of unamortized fair market value step-up of debt acquired in mergers and acquisitions, and $7.4 billion after further excluding cash and cash equivalents of $260 million. Total debt declined $236 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The Company had approximately $3.7 billion of available liquidity from long-term committed credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2022, excluding the $1.0 billion Delayed Draw Term Loan available to be used to acquire the remaining 67.7% interest in Grupo Gondi.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, WestRock invested $293 million in capital expenditures and returned $64 million in capital to stockholders in dividend payments.Segment Reporting StructureIn the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company reorganized its reportable segments due to changes in its organizational structure and how the Company makes key operating decisions, allocates resources and assesses the performance of its business. The Company believes the change provides greater visibility into the vertical integration between our mills and converting operations as well as the value of a diversified portfolio of assets, and helps to highlight the performance of its portfolio.Our reportable segments are:Corrugated Packaging, which consists of our integrated corrugated converting operations;Consumer Packaging, which consists of our integrated consumer converting operations;Global Paper, which consists of all third-party paper sales; andDistribution, which consists of our distribution and display assembly operations.As a result of the reorganization, the Company reports the benefit of vertical integration with its mills in each reportable segment that ultimately sells the associated paper and packaging products to our external customers. Prior to the reorganization, the Company had two reportable segments, Corrugated Packaging and Consumer Packaging.The Company’s measure of segment profitability for each reportable segment is Adjusted EBITDA in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 280, ""Segment Reporting"" because it is the measure used by the Company to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing segment performance. Certain items are not allocated to our reportable segments and, thus, the information that the Company uses to make operating decisions and assess performance does not reflect such amounts. Items not allocated are reported as Non-allocated expenses or in other line items outside of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined on page 10 under ""Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA"". Prior period amounts for our reportable segments have been recast to conform to the new segment structure. These changes did not impact the consolidated financial statements.Segment ResultsCorrugated Packaging SegmentThree Months EndedSep. 30, 2022Sep. 30, 2021Var.% Var.Segment sales$2,386.1$2,203.9$182.28.3%Adjusted EBITDA$383.9$361.4$22.56.2%Adjusted EBITDA Margin16.1%16.4%-30 bpsCorrugated Packaging segment sales increased $182 million, or 8.3%, primarily due to higher selling price/mix that was partially offset by lower volumes.Corrugated Packaging Adjusted EBITDA increased $23 million, or 6.2%, primarily due to the margin impact from higher selling price/mix and ransomware insurance recoveries, which were largely offset by increased cost inflation, higher operating costs and lower volumes.

209,b07affc8-02bd-3ba5-af1a-3155533218c3,CSX,2022-11-10,Is CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) Potentially Undervalued?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/csx-corporation-nasdaq-csx-potentially-110105115.html,1668078065,STORY,['CSX'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX). The company's stock saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine CSX’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for CSX What Is CSX Worth?According to my valuation model, CSX seems to be fairly priced at around 1.6% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy CSX today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $29.91, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that CSX’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of CSX look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of CSX, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 4.3%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in CSX’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on CSX, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with CSX, and understanding it should be part of your investment process.If you are no longer interested in CSX, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

The city of Galveston also marked the day with a proclamation, recognizing the cruise line's commitment to the city and the successful partnership started more than 20 years ago when Royal Caribbean first set sail from Galveston. With the introduction of the Oasis Class, the world's largest cruise ships, it's estimated the new terminal will welcome as many as 630,000 vacationers each year.""We are thrilled to take family vacations to a whole new level in Texas. Our new, 161,334-square-foot terminal opens up a world of vacation possibilities for families in the Southwest,"" said Michael Bayley, president and CEO, Royal Caribbean International. ""Now our unmatched Oasis Class ships, known as the best family vacations in the industry, can set sail from Galveston. Allure of the Seas is just the beginning, and we thank the Port of Galveston, Ceres and all the teams involved for making this bold vision a reality.""Royal Caribbean's Galveston facility is as bold in its sustainable design as the bold adventures that vacationers have in store. The terminal will break even more new ground as the first LEED Zero Energy facility in the world, generating 100% of the energy it needs through onsite solar panels. From the start, the design strategies used to develop the terminal were aligned with parent company Royal Caribbean Group's wholistic environmental goals, its focus to advance the development of sustainable infrastructure as well as its decarbonization strategy – Destination Net Zero.Story continues""This new cruise terminal is a gamechanger for the port and the region,"" said Rodger Rees, Port Director, Port of Galveston. ""This $125 million investment, in collaboration with Royal Caribbean, the port and Ceres, is expected to bring 800 new jobs, $1.4 billion in local business services revenue, $5.6 million in state and local taxes, and incredible business development opportunities. And, of course, Allure of the Seas means more cruising adventures for our Texas cruise guests.""Welcoming vacationers in the terminal as they make their way to Allure is a new, dynamic art sculpture named the Galveston Beach Trio by Texas-based artists Brad Oldham and Christy Coltrin of Brad Oldham Sculpture. The cruise line selected the husband-and-wife team for their one-of-a-kind concept that's inspired by Galveston's rich musical heritage, which includes the likes of Galveston-native and Grammy Award-winning, bass-baritone singer and songwriter Barry White. As the embodiment of the city's island time spirit, the stainless steel and lost-wax bronze sculpture is the perfect backdrop for the start of vacationers' getaways.Allure will set sail from the new homeport on its first cruise on Sunday, Nov. 13. The Oasis Class ship has in store a lineup of thrills, ways to chill, restaurants, nightlife, entertainment and more across seven signature neighborhoods, including the open-air Central Park with thousands of real plants and the Boardwalk neighborhood filled with ways to play and the one-of-a-kind AquaTheater entertainment venue that comes alive with high divers, acrobats, aerialists and more. From a nine-story-high zip line and two FlowRider surf simulators to rock climbing, ice skating, and original productions that span four stages – air, ice, water and theater – there's adventure from end to end.When it comes to refueling in between the action, the 30-plus restaurants, bars and lounges on board serve up a range of flavors like family-style Italian classics at Giovanni's Table, American steakhouse favorites at Chops Grille and fresh sushi and sizzling hibachi at Izumi. New concepts and dishes are coming to Allure as well, including Wipeout Cafe featuring El Loco Fresh. Fitting for the ship's new home in Texas, the venue will serve up El Loco Fresh's popular, grab-and-go Mexican delights like made-to-order quesadillas, tacos, nachos and more. Plus, joining the staples guests know and love at Giovanni's Table will be menu items such as crispy calamari, eggplant parmigiana and caprese salad.Every member of the family can make memories together and on their own adventures any day of the week on Allure.Vacationers can enjoy all that Allure has to offer on the new 7-night Western Caribbean cruises from Galveston and visit sun-soaked destinations, such as Costa Maya and Cozumel, Mexico; and Roatan, Honduras, for the winter 2022-2023 season.About Royal Caribbean InternationalRoyal Caribbean International, owned by Royal Caribbean Group (NYSE: RCL), has been delivering innovation at sea for more than 50 years.

Stories invite perspective-taking: the concept of standing in someone else's shoes and imagining what it's like to be them. It's a drastically underutilized inclusion tool.""That appropriately laid the groundwork for a fascinating conversation among five Birmingham attorneys who shared their personal stories about vastly different experiences growing up and entering the legal profession in Alabama. Those experiences impact their work every day and will leave a legacy for the lawyers of the future.Stories invite perspective-taking: the concept of standing in someone else's shoes and imagining what it's like to be them. It's a drastically underutilized inclusion tool.Harvard Business ReviewParticipants included former judge Ken Simon, founder of Ken Simon Law; retired judge Scott Vowell, founder of Vowell &amp; Associates, LLC; Leila Watson, principal at Cory Watson Attorneys; Sara Williams, trial attorney at Alexander Shunnarah Trial Attorneys; and J.R. Thomas, an associate at Gregory Fann, LLC.The Birmingham Legal Leaders DEI series was created by Regions Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary Tara Plimpton and executed by the legal department's Culture and Equity team, led by Nix.Thursday's virtual presentation was kicked off by Plimpton, who provided some history and context for the DEI series. ""Everyone attending this seminar understands the value of diversity, equity and inclusion - and how diverse talent in an organization enables critical thinking and diversity of thought.""Story continuesPlimpton and Nix turned the meeting over to moderators Shayla Fletcher and Kristi Dowdy, members of the Regions legal department. Fletcher and Dowdy encouraged the attorneys - who together have 161 years of legal experience - to share the moments that have shaped their world view and how the legacy they inherited impacts their work.Vowell led the conversation, and with 61 years of law practice in Alabama, he had much to say about the degree of change in law and society during his storied career. He grew up in segregated Anniston, Alabama, and as he recalled, ""I never sat in the classroom with a person of color until after I graduated law school at the University of Virginia.""He highlighted events he observed as a young lawyer in Birmingham that raised his social consciousness, including Dr. Martin Luther King's ""Birmingham revolution,"" the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in 1963, and the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.""On Monday mornings the waiting room of our law office was full of people who had been beaten up by Bull Connor's policemen,"" he recalled. ""It didn't take me long to realize changes needed to be made. I don't see how anybody who saw what I saw in those days wouldn't do what they could to change it.""Simon, on the other hand, was born in 1954, the year that the United States Supreme Court ended school segregation in Brown v. Board of Education. Simon grew up during the Civil Rights era in a low-income housing project in Mobile, Alabama. He recalled seeing Governor George Wallace on television giving his 1963 inaugural speech.""When the governor of your state is talking about segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever - and the entire legislature stands up and cheers - you hear that message and you're part of a segregated community, you think ‘what is it going to take to change?'""Simon's grandfather's home in Mobile was across the street from a law firm. As a boy he watched closely and recognized their leadership in the community, especially in the area of civil rights. He decided then he wanted to be a lawyer and a change agent.Watson, who is third-generation Japanese American, grew up in Pennsylvania with a father who taught his children to fight and protect one another against the prejudices they endured. And they did.She begrudgingly accepted a position in Birmingham after graduating from Maryland Law School in 1983. ""I hated the thought of it, but it turned out to be a delight,"" she said. ""Birmingham was shockingly segregated even in the ‘80s but I have always been treated well - until the COVID-19 pandemic.""She spoke about taking on leadership roles in local and state bar associations and the importance of having female minorities in these positions. ""You can't build a platform if you're not present,"" she said.Williams, who grew up in a military family, lived all over the world and had a very diverse upbringing. Then she chose to go to Cumberland School of Law in Birmingham, which she described as ""the whitest private law school in the country."" But the irony is that law school was a very transformative experience for her. ""I developed my sense of self there,"" she said.She learned to be comfortable being herself and not shy away from being a strong woman. Williams recalled her experiences throughout her career of being ""the only"" and reconciling that. ""I was hired because I was a good trial lawyer and my diversity was a bonus,"" she said. ""A law firm is not going to hire you if you don't have skills.""Thomas, the youngest attorney in the group, has been practicing since 2019. He is active in the National LGBTQ+ Bar Association and talked about the opportunity that state and local bar associations have to reach out to this segment of the legal community. ""In my family law work, I deal with a lot of LGBTQ+ children's issues, and more support in this area would be very helpful.""After explaining how their personal stories have shaped their careers and their positions on DEI issues, the participants were asked about obstacles they see to achieving greater equity. Vowell spoke at length about the lack of racial diversity on the judicial bench and how the current method of electing judges is perpetuating the problem. ""People have to see people that look like them on the bench,"" he said.Simon agreed and added that a lack of diversity on the plaintiff side is also an issue, as well as business development for Black lawyers. He encouraged minority attorneys to be change agents. ""Through leadership, advocacy and nonprofit work, we can play a big role in making our communities better,"" he said.The racial inequities tied to death penalty laws are an important issue for Watson. She echoed the need for community involvement, saying, ""All lawyers were trained to advocate for someone other than themselves. We should all be doing pro bono work for people who can least afford a lawyer."" She also emphasized the importance of mentorship, which is ""very rewarding and important - worth the effort.""The discussion was very impactful for the audience, as indicated by the positive feedback immediately forwarded at the close of the meeting.""I think having that group of lawyers tell their stories is a great way to communicate our history, our issues and how and why we need to continue to push for progress,"" said a viewer from a large Birmingham firm.Another local attorney said, ""This program provided inspiration and profound lessons. One of those is that, while none of us single-handedly can change our society, each of us can help to move our culture in the right direction.""The Regions Legal team was also pleased with the discussion and looks forward to building on the success of these four webinars. Fletcher teased a new format that's in the works, saying, ""We're contemplating new and different ways to take meaningful strides toward greater equity in the community. The Birmingham Legal Leaders programming may look different in the future but we're not done yet!""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Regions Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Regions BankWebsite: profiles/regions-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Regions BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/724767/The-Role-of-Storytelling-in-Building-Inclusion]"

(NYSE:V)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportunity-visa-inc-nyse-110059100.html,1668078059,STORY,['V'],"[Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$217 and falling to the lows of US$178. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Visa's current trading price of US$194 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Visa’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Visa Is Visa Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, Visa seems to be fairly priced at around 18% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Visa today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $236.10, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. What's more, Visa’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.Can we expect growth from Visa?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Visa's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 41%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in V’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on V, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Diving deeper into the forecasts for Visa mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

218,2845c1ed-31ca-3050-bb1b-a253fa1d54ba,MAR,2022-11-10,"EXPLAINER-Blood, treasure and chaos: the cost of Russia's war in Ukraine",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-blood-treasure-chaos-cost-122319804.html,1668082999,STORY,"['KW=F', 'PA=F', 'NG=F']","[By Guy FaulconbridgeLONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has left tens of thousands of dead, displaced millions and spread economic strife across the world.Following are the main impacts of the war, now in its ninth month:* DEATHThe war has sown death on a level not seen in Europe since World War Two.From Feb. 24 to Oct. 2, 6,114 civilians were reported killed and 9,132 injured, though the actual numbers are much higher, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said on Oct. 3.""Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects, including shelling from heavy artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, missiles and air strikes,"" OHCHR said.Ukraine has not said how many of its soldiers have been killed. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Sept. 21 that 5,937 Russian soldiers had been killed since the start of the war.Both Ukraine and Russia say the other side has sustained devastatingly high casualties. Reuters was unable to verify battlefield claims from either side.The United States' top general estimated on Nov. 9 that Russia and Ukraine had each seen more than 100,000 of their soldiers killed or wounded. ""A lot of human suffering,"" Army General Mark Milley told the Economic Club of New York.Milley said the conflict so far had turned anywhere from 15 million to 30 million Ukrainians into refugees, and killed probably 40,000 Ukrainian civilians.The conflict in eastern Ukraine began in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution and Russia annexed Crimea, with Russian-backed separatist forces fighting Ukraine's armed forces.About 14,000 people were killed there between 2014 and the end of 2021, according to OHCHR, including 3,106 civilians.*MISERYSince Feb. 24, one third of Ukrainians have been forced from their homes, the largest current human displacement crisis in the world, the United Nations refugee agency has said. Ukraine has a population of more than 41 million.Story continuesThere are currently more than 7.8 million refugees from Ukraine recorded across Europe, with the biggest numbers in Poland, Russia and Germany, according to the agency's data.* UKRAINEBesides the human losses, Ukraine has lost control of around 22% of its land to Russia since the 2014 annexation of Crimea, according to Reuters calculations.It has lost a swathe of coastline, its economy has been crippled and some cities have been turned into wastelands by Russian shelling. Ukraine's economy will contract by 45% in 2022, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have estimated.The true dollar cost to Ukraine is unclear. It is unclear how much Ukraine has spent on fighting.* RUSSIAThe war has been expensive for Russia too - though it does not disclose the costs which are state secrets.Besides the military costs, the West has tried to punish Moscow by imposing severe sanctions - the biggest shock to Russia's economy since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.Russia's central bank last month improved its GDP forecast for this year to a contraction of 3-3.5% from an expected 4-6% decline previously. In late April, it had expected GDP to shrink 8-10%.The economy ministry sees a contraction of 2.9% this year and a 0.8% fall in 2023.Still the impact on Russia's economy is severe - and not yet fully clear. It has been excluded from Western financial markets, most of its oligarchs are sanctioned, and it is experiencing problems sourcing some items such as microchips.Russia has defaulted on its foreign bonds for the first time since the calamitous months following the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.The central bank has cautioned that the partial mobilisation could stoke longer-term inflation. The central bank tweaked its year-end inflation forecast to 12-13% from 11-13%.* PRICESThe invasion and Western sanctions on Russia led to steep rises in the prices of fertiliser, wheat, metals and energy, feeding into both a brewing food crisis and an inflationary wave that is crashing through the global economy.Russia is the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the world's biggest exporter of natural gas, wheat, nitrogen fertiliser and palladium. Shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, international oil prices spiked to their highest levels since the records of 2008.Attempts to reduce reliance on Russian oil, gas and oil products - or even to cap their prices - have exacerbated what is already the most severe energy crunch since the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s.The war has cut global growth while an energy crisis in Europe could tip Europe into a deeper crisis, according to Goldman Sachs which expects global GDP growth to slow to 1.8% in 2023.* WESTERN WEAPONSThe United States has provided more than $18.2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Feb. 24 including stinger anti-aircraft systems, Javelin anti-armour systems, 155mm Howitzers and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear protective equipment.In total, about 52 billion euros in military, financial and humanitarian aid had been pledged by Oct. 3 to Ukraine by countries around the world, according to The Kiel Institute for the World Economy.Russia says that the West's supplies of advanced weapons to Ukraine are finding their way onto the black market and then into the hands of extremist and criminal groups in the Middle East, central Africa and Asia.(Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge, Editing by Gareth Jones and Andrew Heavens)]"

NWSA witnessed revenue declines across all its segments except Dow Jones.Shares of this diversified media and information services company have lost 7.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 10.4%.Quarterly DetailsNews Corporation delivered adjusted quarterly earnings of 12 cents a share. The bottom-line figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents and plunged 47.8% from adjusted earnings of 23 cents reported in the last fiscal year’s comparable period.Total revenues of $2,478 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,568 million and dipped 1% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s levels. The decline was mainly due to negative foreign currency fluctuations and lower revenues at the Book Publishing segment on account of lower physical book sales from Amazon, partly offset by higher revenues in the Dow Jones segment. Foreign currency fluctuations had a 6% negative impact on revenues. Adjusted revenues rose 3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTotal EBITDA decreased 15% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level to $350 million, thanks to higher costs due to inflationary pressures and lower sales. Foreign currency fluctuations had a $23-million negative impact on total segment EBITDA. Adjusted total segment EBITDA fell 13%.Segment DetailsRevenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment slipped 1% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading to $421 million, induced by a 5% negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted segment revenues increased 3%.Revenues in Move dipped 6% to $169 million due to lower real-estate revenues, somewhat offset by increased advertising revenues. Real Estate revenues, contributing 84% to total Move revenues, fell 9% due to the tough macroeconomic landscape, including higher household interest rates. The referral model generated 30% of the overall Move revenues in the reported quarter. Move’s internal data shows that average monthly unique users of Realtor.com’s web and mobile sites fell 11% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s tally to 86 million. Lead volume also dropped 32%.Revenues at the REA Group inched up 2% to $252 million, driven by greater depth penetration, growth in national listings and higher Australian residential revenues on price increases. The upside was somewhat offset by 9% foreign currency headwinds and lower financial services revenues.The Subscription Video Services segment’s revenues were $502 million, down 2% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals. Foreign currency fluctuations adversely impacted the segment’s revenues by 8%. Increased revenues from Kayo and BINGE as well as higher commercial and advertising revenues were partly offset by fewer residential broadcast subscribers. Adjusted segment’s revenues rose 6% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level to $542 million.Foxtel Group streaming subscription revenues represented nearly 25% of the overall circulation and subscription revenues compared with 19% in the prior year. Foxtel’s total closing paid subscribers were 4.5 million as of Sep 30, 2022, reflecting an increase of 16% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level. The upside can be attributed to an increase in BINGE and Kayo subscribers, partly offset by lower residential broadcast subscribers. Broadcast subscriber churn improved slightly to 14.2% from 14% in the previous fiscal year. Broadcast ARPU grew 1% from the year-earlier fiscal quarter’s reading to A$83 (US$57).This presently Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) player’s revenues at the Dow Jones segment rose 16% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level to $515 million. This includes contributions of $34 million and $18 million from the buyouts of OPIS and CMA, respectively. Adjusted segment revenues grew 6% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level owing to higher circulation and subscription revenues from digital subscription gains and growth in the Risk &amp; Compliance products, and increased digital advertising revenues. The segment’s digital revenues contributed 79% to total revenues compared with 75% seen in the last fiscal year.Circulation and subscription revenues improved 19% during the fiscal quarter under discussion. Circulation revenues rose 5%, driven by consistent strength in the digital-only subscriptions at The Wall Street Journal. Professional information business revenues jumped 40%, mainly driven by the OPIS and CMA acquisitions and an improvement in the Risk &amp; Compliance products, offset by negative currency fluctuations. Digital circulation revenues represented 68% of the circulation revenues.Advertising revenues increased 4%, primarily owing to an 11% rise in digital advertising revenues, partly offset by a 6%-drop in print advertising revenues. Digital advertising accounted for nearly 65% of the total advertising revenues in the reported quarter.During the fiscal quarter, the overall average subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products reached above 4.9 million, up 8% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level. Digital-only subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products rose 13%. Subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal jumped 8% to 3.8 million average subscriptions. Digital-only subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal increased 13% to more than 3.1 million average subscriptions, accounting for 84% of the total Wall Street Journal subscriptions.The Book Publishing segment reported revenues of $487 million, down 11% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level, mainly due to the lower physical book sales stemming from Amazon’s reset of its inventory levels and rightsizing of the warehouse footprint. This resulted in lower order volumes and higher returns in spite of the consumer sales data being consistent with the previous quarters’ statistics. Foreign currency headwinds also hurt revenues to the tune of 4%. Major titles in the fiscal quarter included Portrait of an Unknown Woman by Daniel Silva, Live Wire: Long-Winded Short Stories by Kelly Ripa and Breaking History by Jared Kushner.  The segment’s adjusted revenues fell 7%. Digital sales grew 1% on increased sales of downloadable audiobooks, offset by lower e-book sales. Digital sales accounted for 23% of the consumer revenues compared with 21% in the prior fiscal year. Backlist sales represented about 65% of the overall revenues in the fiscal first quarter.Revenues in the News Media segment dipped 4% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level to $553 million in the reported quarter due to the adverse impact of 11% from the foreign currency fluctuations. This was partly offset by increased circulation and subscription revenues, and growth in advertising revenues at constant currency. Within the segment, revenues at News Corp Australia rose 1%, while the metric at News UK declined 9%. Adjusted revenues for the segment climbed 6%.Circulation and subscription revenues dipped 6% due to lower print volumes and a 12% adverse impact from foreign currency fluctuations.Advertising revenues dipped 4% due to negative foreign currency fluctuations of 9% because of a fall in print advertising at News UK and lower revenues at Wireless Group, partly due to the absence of the Euro 2020.Digital revenues contributed 36% to the News Media segment’s revenues compared with 33% in the year-ago fiscal quarter. The same accounted for 33% of the combined revenues of the newspaper mastheads. As of Sep 30, 2022, The Times and Sunday Times’ closing digital subscribers comprising the Times Literary Supplement were 468,000. The same at the News Corp Australia was 1,012,000. New York Post’s digital network attained about 151 million monthly unique users in the same month.Story continuesOther Financial AspectsNews Corporation ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,458 million, borrowings of $2,977 million and a stockholders’ equity of $7,872 million, excluding non-controlling interest of $856 million.Net cash used by operating activities amounted to $31 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

223,e6ad9b7f-36cd-3e07-bc07-d45977c77343,NWSA,2022-11-10,4 Stocks to Watch in a Prospering Entertainment Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-watch-prospering-entertainment-141302197.html,1668003182,STORY,"['WWE', 'NWSA', '^GSPC']","[The Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry is benefiting from a spike in demand for digital entertainment, fueled by lingering capacity and operational limitations in movie theaters, theme parks and cruise lines. Increased consumption of media, music and news over the web triggered by the work-and-learn-at-home wave has been a key catalyst for industry participants like News Corporation NWSA, World Wrestling Entertainment WWE, iQIYI IQ and CuriosityStream CURI. Companies have been focusing on a superior product strategy and prudent capital investments. Steady recovery in the advertising spending environment and resumption of production pipelines bode well for film and television production companies.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry comprises companies involved in film and TV production, distribution and exhibition. The main activities of the industry participants include the production and distribution of entertainment content to theaters, TV networks, video-on-demand platforms, streaming services and other exhibitors. Imax offers entertainment technology and specializes in motion picture technologies and presentations. Industry participants produce and distribute motion pictures for theatrical and straight-to-video releases besides TV programming. These players are heavily dependent on the box-office performance of their films, both domestically and internationally, the number of film releases and the ratings of TV shows.3 Film and Television Production Industry Trends in FocusOver-the-Top Services Gaining Prominence: Companies involved in content creation are looking to distribute content through over-the-top services to leverage the popularity of their franchises. With this, they are looking to provide exclusive content and a differentiated experience. However, streaming companies are increasingly producing original and award-winning feed to reduce licensing costs and excessive dependence on third-party content providers. This is likely to hurt industry participants’ content distribution strategy.Story continuesBinge-Watching Driving Consumption: Factors such as binge-watching, deepening Internet penetration and advancement in mobile, video, and wireless technologies have got viewers glued to small screens. In order to keep pace with new consumption patterns, industry participants are turning to digital content distribution. The emergence of digital capabilities is making consumer data easily available to companies. With the use of AI tools, production houses are gaining a better understanding of user preference. This is helping them produce content that strikes a chord with viewers. However, increasing spending on content and sales &amp; marketing is hurting profitability due to stiff competition from streaming players.Technological Advancement Aids Prospects: Exhibitors are turning to highly efficient and cost-effective technologies like laser-based projection systems to enhance image quality and the entire movie experience. Additionally, the use of technologies like motion seating, immersive audio systems and interactive movies among others is expected to enhance the viewing experience. The increasing adoption of AR and VR technologies bodes well for industry participants. However, the evolution of alternative motion picture distribution channels such as home video, pay-per-view, streaming services, video-on-demand, Internet and syndicated and broadcast television is hurting exhibitors.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #96, which places it in the top 38% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic on this group’s earnings growth potential. Since Nov 31, 2021, the industry’s earnings estimate for 2022 has moved up 56.3%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500, Beats SectorThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite but beat its own sector in the past year.The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 38.2% compared with the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 19.7% and the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s decline of 43.1% over the same time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S), a commonly used multiple for valuing Film and Television Production and Distribution stocks, the industry is currently trading at 1.16X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 3.48X and the sector’s 1.79X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 2.48X and as low as 0.92X, recording a median of 1.49X as the chart below shows.Trailing 12-Month Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio4 Film &amp; Television Stocks to Watch Right NowWorld Wrestling Entertainment: Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have risen 52.6% year to date.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Financial Group, Inc. AFG, Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc. BHLB, Snap-on Inc. SNA, Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. NOG and Service Corporation International SCI.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Buy These 5 Stocks that Recently Announced Dividend HikesWall Street witnessed a solid rebound in October after a disappointing September, and it has been a good November so far. On Nov 8, all three major indexes closed higher for the third straight day.However, market participants remain concerned as the Fed last week not only went for a steep rate hike but also hinted at continuing its aggressive monetary policy till it is able to get complete control over surging inflation.The Fed is now expected to go ahead with its steep rate hikes till sky-high commodity prices don’t cool off to the desired levels. Also, bond yields have lately been rising to record highs on fears of further steep interest rate hikes.Fed to Continue Hiking Interest RatesInvestors had held high hopes that the Fed might go slow on its aggressive rate hike stance after economic data released in late October hinted at easing inflation. Market participants had hoped that the rate hike in November could also be the last of the steep interest rate hikes.On Nov 4, the Fed hiked interest rates by 75 basis points for the fourth consecutive time this year. The 75-basis point hike was expected and Fed Chair Jerome Powell also hinted that it is too premature to think about pausing the aggressive rate hikes.Instead, Powell indicated at the Fed to continue with its steep rate hike stance and that the Fed’s benchmark rate may require topping the level of core inflation to get complete control of surging inflation.Story continuesPowell’s comments now suggest that the central bank is likely to push its benchmark interest rate target above the 5% mark and then leave it there for a while for core inflation to come down to its target 2%.The inflation reading showed an 8.2% surge in September on a year-over-year basis. Although inflation has marginally eased from August’s high of 8.3%, it is still in an uncomfortable zone for the average American and the Fed.Also, COVID-19 infections are on the rise in China once again. Authorities have implemented restrictions to stop another outbreak. Amid all these, the ongoing geopolitical unrest between Russia and Ukraine poses risks to the global supply chain and is resulting in volatility in the stock market.Higher interest rates mean a higher cost of borrowing. This increases the possibility of an economic downturn. Both are negative signs for markets, which have been experiencing volatility throughout this year.So, it makes sense for an astute investor to keep an eye on dividend-paying stocks. This is because dividend stocks can endure market volatility since they have a history of success and a strong business model.They offer a steady stream of revenues and have fewer chances of their prices moving significantly. Actually, during times of market turbulence, dividend-paying equities have frequently outperformed non-dividend-paying stocks. Five such companies are American Financial Group, Inc., Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc., Snap-on Inc., Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. and Service Corporation International.American Financial Group, Inc. is a holding company, which, through its subsidiaries, engages primarily in property and casualty insurance, with a focus on specialized commercial products for businesses. AFG also engages in the sale of traditional fixed, fixed-indexed and variable-indexed annuities in the retail, financial institutions, registered investment advisor and education markets. AFG presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

On Nov 8, all three major indexes closed higher for the third straight day.However, market participants remain concerned as the Fed last week not only went for a steep rate hike but also hinted at continuing its aggressive monetary policy till it is able to get complete control over surging inflation.The Fed is now expected to go ahead with its steep rate hikes till sky-high commodity prices don’t cool off to the desired levels. Also, bond yields have lately been rising to record highs on fears of further steep interest rate hikes.Fed to Continue Hiking Interest RatesInvestors had held high hopes that the Fed might go slow on its aggressive rate hike stance after economic data released in late October hinted at easing inflation. Market participants had hoped that the rate hike in November could also be the last of the steep interest rate hikes.On Nov 4, the Fed hiked interest rates by 75 basis points for the fourth consecutive time this year. The 75-basis point hike was expected and Fed Chair Jerome Powell also hinted that it is too premature to think about pausing the aggressive rate hikes.Instead, Powell indicated at the Fed to continue with its steep rate hike stance and that the Fed’s benchmark rate may require topping the level of core inflation to get complete control of surging inflation.Powell’s comments now suggest that the central bank is likely to push its benchmark interest rate target above the 5% mark and then leave it there for a while for core inflation to come down to its target 2%.The inflation reading showed an 8.2% surge in September on a year-over-year basis. Although inflation has marginally eased from August’s high of 8.3%, it is still in an uncomfortable zone for the average American and the Fed.Also, COVID-19 infections are on the rise in China once again. Authorities have implemented restrictions to stop another outbreak. Amid all these, the ongoing geopolitical unrest between Russia and Ukraine poses risks to the global supply chain and is resulting in volatility in the stock market.Story continuesHigher interest rates mean a higher cost of borrowing. This increases the possibility of an economic downturn. Both are negative signs for markets, which have been experiencing volatility throughout this year.So, it makes sense for an astute investor to keep an eye on dividend-paying stocks. This is because dividend stocks can endure market volatility since they have a history of success and a strong business model.They offer a steady stream of revenues and have fewer chances of their prices moving significantly. Actually, during times of market turbulence, dividend-paying equities have frequently outperformed non-dividend-paying stocks. Five such companies are American Financial Group, Inc.

226,c7b28a81-c798-39ee-87ff-b26e72e3bc48,KLAC,2022-11-10,"KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) Passed Our Checks, And It's About To Pay A US$1.30 Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kla-corporation-nasdaq-klac-passed-112849917.html,1668079729,STORY,['KLAC'],"[It looks like KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 3 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase KLA's shares before the 14th of November in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of December.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.30 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$5.20 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, KLA has a trailing yield of approximately 1.5% on its current stock price of $337.52. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether KLA has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for KLA Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. KLA is paying out just 20% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out 21% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservatively low.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see KLA's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 31% per annum for the past five years. KLA earnings per share have been sprinting ahead like the Road Runner at a track and field day; scarcely stopping even for a cheeky ""beep-beep"". We also like that it is reinvesting most of its profits in its business.'The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. KLA has delivered 14% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.Final TakeawayIs KLA worth buying for its dividend? KLA has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.In light of that, while KLA has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example - KLA has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

229,f0813f5a-7048-3f5b-a446-e5d8fd006d5b,VZ,2022-11-10,Here's What's Concerning About Verizon Communications' (NYSE:VZ) Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-whats-concerning-verizon-communications-110116372.html,1668078076,STORY,['VZ'],"[If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. In light of that, when we looked at Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Verizon Communications is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.083 = US$27b ÷ (US$375b - US$53b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Verizon Communications has an ROCE of 8.3%.  On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 8.1%. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Verizon Communications compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at Verizon Communications, we didn't gain much confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 8.3% from 13% five years ago. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayTo conclude, we've found that Verizon Communications is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 7.1% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. Therefore, if you're looking for a multi-bagger, we'd propose looking at other options.One more thing to note, we've identified   2 warning signs  with Verizon Communications and understanding these should be part of your investment process.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Sales grew 2 percent to $1.51 billion from $1.48 in the prior year.More from WWDBackstage at Coach RTW Spring 2023Coach RTW Spring 2023All the Celebrities at Kate Spade's NYFW PresentationThe company said that it managed to achieve a sales increase of 11 percent in international markets with strength in Japan, Europe and Asian countries other than China, where it was impacted by continued COVID-related disruptions.Tapestry also posted a low-single-digit increase in direct-to-consumer sales led by a high-single-digit gain in its physical store fleet which offset a high-single-digit decline in digital sales.Joanne Crevoiserat, chief executive officer, said, “Our results exceeded expectations despite the more challenging backdrop, demonstrating the strength of our iconic brands, the agility of our operating model, and the consistent execution of our global teams. We delivered record first quarter revenue, led by International growth, and drove AUR gains in our core categories. At the same time, we continued to invest in our brands and business, while returning cash to shareholders, underscoring our confidence in the significant runway ahead over our planning horizon.”Even so, she expressed caution going forward due to the “uncertain” economy, but said the corporation will continue to be “disciplined in advancing our strategic objectives through an unwavering focus on the consumer and a commitment to innovation. Importantly, our competitive advantages and transformation into a more nimble and responsive organization position us to drive sustainable, long-term growth and meaningful shareholder value.”Despite the headwinds, the company still plans to return about $1 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2023 through share repurchasing and dividends.For fiscal year 2023, the company is expecting “more modest revenue” in North America and Greater China which should be offset by “outperformance” in the rest of Asia and Europe. It is now projecting sales of $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion for the year, a slight decline from prior projections of $6.9 billion, and earnings per diluted share of $3.60 to $3.70, a dip of 50 cents due to the currency issues.]"

This includes the following assumptions:Share Repurchases: Tapestry remains on track to buy back approximately $700 million in common stock in the fiscal year. As projected, this includes approximately $100 million spent in the first quarter to repurchase roughly 3 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $33.83.Dividend Payments: The Company continues to anticipate paying an annual dividend of $1.20 per share, representing a 20% increase compared to prior year, totaling approximately $300 million.Tapestry, Inc. Fiscal First Quarter Financial &amp; Strategic HighlightsDuring the first quarter, the Company advanced its strategic priorities focused on building lasting customer relationships, fueling fashion innovation and product excellence, delivering compelling omni-channel experiences and powering global growth. Highlights of the quarter were as follows:Drove customer engagement with our brands, highlighted by an increase in spend per customer, supported by higher units per transaction and stronger purchase frequency; acquired approximately 1.4 million new customers in North America alone;Delivered revenue growth of 2% compared to the prior year; sales rose over 5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, excluding an FX headwind of approximately 370 basis points;Achieved a sales increase of 11% at constant currency in International markets, which included outsized gains in Other Asia, Japan and Europe, more than offsetting an 11% decline in Greater China due to Covid-related disruption; in North America, revenue rose slightly versus prior year on both a reported and constant currency basis;Drove omni-channel growth with a low-single-digit increase in direct-to-consumer sales at constant currency, led by a high-single-digit gain in store revenue as consumers continued to return to in-person experiences, which offset a high-single-digit decline in Digital; on a two-year basis, Digital revenue increased over 35% and more than tripled from FY19 pre-pandemic levels;Fueled fashion innovation and product excellence to drive AUR gains in each brand’s core category at constant currency, driven by planned ticket increases and enabled by data and analytics that enhanced the Company’s go-to-market strategies, including a deeper understanding of consumer preferences;Continued to invest in platform capabilities and brand building, underscored by marketing at 8% of sales, an increase compared to 7% of revenue in the prior year period;Delivered earnings per diluted share ahead of expectations, including a favorable timing shift of approximately $0.05 with the second quarter as well as a benefit from a lower tax rate of $0.03, partially offset by incremental FX headwinds of approximately $0.03;Returned $175 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.Overview of Fiscal First Quarter 2023 Financial ResultsNet sales totaled $1.51 billion for the first quarter compared to $1.48 billion in the prior year, representing a reported year-over-year increase of approximately 2%. Excluding a 370 basis point headwind from currency due to the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar, revenue rose over 5% versus last year.Gross profit totaled $1.05 billion, while gross margin was 70.0%. As anticipated, the Company’s gross margin was negatively impacted by incremental freight expense, which totaled $20 million or approximately 130 basis points, as well as an FX headwind of approximately 70 basis points. This compared to prior year gross profit of $1.07 billion, representing a gross margin of 72.2%.SG&amp;A expenses totaled $800 million and represented 53.1% of sales. This compared to reported SG&amp;A expenses in the prior year of $774 million, which represented 52.2% of sales. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&amp;A expenses were $762 million, or 51.4% of sales in the prior year period.Operating income was $254 million, while operating margin was 16.9%. This compared to reported operating income of $295 million and operating margin of 19.9% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, prior year operating income was $307 million, while operating margin was 20.7%.Net interest expense was $7 million in the quarter compared to $16 million in the year-ago period.Other expense was $11 million in the quarter, primarily due to an FX loss associated with the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar. This compared to $2 million of other expense in the prior year period.Net income was $195 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.79. This compared to reported net income of $227 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.80 in the prior year period. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $235 million with earnings per diluted share of $0.82 in the prior year period. The tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%, as compared to the prior year tax rate of 18.0% on a reported basis and 18.6% on a non-GAAP basis.Balance Sheet and Cash Flow HighlightsCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $557 million and total borrowings outstanding were $1.68 billion.Inventory at quarter-end was $1.14 billion versus ending inventory of $818 million a year ago, which included an increase of nearly 50% in in-transits year-over-year.Free cash flow for the quarter was an outflow of $198 million compared to an outflow of $12 million in the prior year. CapEx and implementation costs related to Cloud Computing for the quarter were $45 million versus $33 million a year ago.Fiscal Year 2023 OutlookThe Company is updating its Fiscal 2023 earnings outlook due entirely to an estimated headwind of $0.20 based on incremental currency pressure resulting from the further strengthening of the U.S. Dollar. Excluding this FX impact, the Company’s earnings outlook is unchanged from prior guidance, as a more modest revenue outlook in North America and Greater China is expected to be fully offset by outperformance in Rest of Asia and Europe, additional expense reductions, and tax rate favorability, demonstrating the agility of Tapestry’s globally diversified model.Tapestry expects the following for Fiscal 2023, which replaces all previous guidance:Revenue of $6.5 billion to $6.6 billion. This represents a slight decline versus prior year on a reported basis due entirely to approximately 450 basis points of FX pressure. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth is expected to be roughly 2% to 4%.Net interest expense of approximately $30 to $35 million;Tax rate of approximately 20%;Weighted average diluted share count of approximately 242 million shares, incorporating approximately $700 million of expected share repurchases;Earnings per diluted share of $3.60 to $3.70, representing mid-single digit growth compared to the prior year and includes a currency headwind of approximately $0.50.In addition, the Company reiterates its 2025 strategic growth plan and financial targets as provided at its September 2022 Investor Day.The Company's outlook assumes the following:No further appreciation of the U.S. Dollar; information provided based on spot rates at the time of forecast;Continued gradual recovery in Greater China from Covid-related disruption; no further significant lockdowns or incremental supply chain pressures from the Covid-19 pandemic;No material worsening of inflationary pressures or consumer confidence; andNo benefit from the potential reinstatement of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).Given the dynamic nature of these and other external factors, financial results could differ materially from the outlook provided.Conference Call DetailsThe Company will host a conference call to review these results at 8:00 a.m. (ET) today, November 10, 2022.

The Company's management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, the non-GAAP measures utilized by the Company may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The financial information presented above, as well as SG&amp;A expense ratio, and operating margin, have been presented both including and excluding Acceleration Program costs for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. There were no items affecting comparability in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.The Company operates on a global basis and reports financial results in U.S. dollars in accordance with GAAP. Percentage increases/decreases in net sales for the Company and each segment have been presented both including and excluding currency fluctuation effects from translating foreign-denominated sales into U.S. dollars and compared to the same periods in the prior quarter and fiscal year. The Company calculates constant currency net sales results by translating current period net sales in local currency using the prior year period’s currency conversion rate.Net sales changes for the Company and each segment are based on absolute sales dollar changes and are not presented in accordance with the Company’s comparable sales definition utilized historically due to the uncertain business environment resulting from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.Management utilizes these non-GAAP and constant currency measures to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods affected and to make decisions about Company resources and performance. The Company believes presenting these non-GAAP measures, which exclude items that are not comparable from period to period, is useful to investors and others in evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating and financial results in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance and understanding how such results compare with the Company’s historical performance. Additionally, the Company believes presenting these metrics on a constant currency basis will help investors and analysts to understand the effect of significant year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on these performance measures and provide a framework to assess how business is performing and expected to perform excluding these effects.Schedule 4: Condensed Consolidated Balance SheetsTAPESTRY, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETSAt October 1, 2022 and July 2, 2022(in millions) (unaudited)(audited)October 1, 2022July 2, 2022ASSETSCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments$557.1$953.2Receivables 269.6 252.3Inventories 1,139.8 994.2Other current assets 420.9 374.1Total current assets 2,387.4 2,573.8Property and equipment, net 526.3 544.4Lease right-of-use assets 1,281.6 1,281.6Other noncurrent assets 2,884.7 2,865.5Total assets$7,080.0$7,265.3LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITYAccounts payable$510.9$520.7Accrued liabilities 489.8 628.2Short-term lease liabilities 282.7 288.7Current debt 25.0 31.2Total current liabilities 1,308.4 1,468.8Long-term debt 1,653.4 1,659.2Long-term lease liabilities 1,273.3 1,282.3Other liabilities 589.5 569.5Stockholders' equity 2,255.4 2,285.5Total liabilities and stockholders' equity$7,080.0$7,265.3Schedule 5: Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash FlowsTAPESTRY, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWSFor the three months ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021(in millions) (unaudited)(unaudited)October 1,2022October 2,2021Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesNet income$195.3$226.9Adjustments to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash flows from operating activities:Depreciation and amortization 43.8 50.8Other non-cash items (10.0) 3.7Changes in operating assets and liabilities (399.5) (259.6)Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (170.4) 21.8 Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesPurchases of property and equipment (27.3) (33.4)Other items 174.1 (395.0)Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 146.8 (428.4) Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesDividend payments (72.7) (69.6)Repurchase of common stock (94.9) (250.0)Other items (58.6) (26.6)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (226.2) (346.2)Effect of exchange rate on cash and cash equivalents (13.5) (2.3) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (263.3) (755.1)Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period$789.8$2,007.7Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 526.5 1,252.6Schedule 6: Store Count by Brand – 1Q23TAPESTRY, INC.STORE COUNTAt July 2, 2022 and October 1, 2022(unaudited) As ofAs ofDirectly-Operated Store Count:July 2, 2022Openings(Closures)October 1, 2022 CoachNorth America3431(3)341International60210(4)608 Kate SpadeNorth America207--207International1913(2)192 Stuart WeitzmanNorth America39-(1)38International61-(1)60 View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221110005369/en/ContactsTapestry, Inc.Media: Andrea Shaw ResnickChief Communications Officer212/629-2618aresnick@tapestry.comAnalysts and Investors: Christina ColoneGlobal Head of Investor Relations212/946-7252ccolone@tapestry.comKelsey Mueller212/946-8183Director of Investor Relationskmueller@tapestry.com]"

That increases the likelihood that there won’t be any big initiatives that succeed in the next term.Investors are also awaiting Thursday’s report on inflation for October, believing the pace will cool from the prior 12-month period. That is something that could convince the Federal Reserve to ease off on its aggressive interest rate hikes to tame inflation.Analysts are divided on whether the Fed will make one more 0.75 percentage point increase to rates when it meets in December, or whether it will make a lower half-point hike.New jobless claims for last week also come out tomorrow and could help put more clarity on the condition of the labor market. The job numbers for October were better than expected, but big tech companies such as Meta Platforms continue to cut jobs and holiday hiring by retailers is estimated to be lower than last year.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:1. Consumer pricesThe CPI for October is expected out at 8:30 ET (13:30 GMT). Analysts expect the year-to-year gain to be 8%, which is less than the 8.2% in the previous 12-month reading. From September, CPI is expected to gain 0.6% compared with 0.4% the prior month.On a core basis, which excludes energy and food prices, CPI is expected to rise 6.5% for the year, from 6.6% in the prior reading, and 0.5% for the month, from 0.6% the month before.2.

If you want to skip our discussion on Jones’ outlook on the economic environment, go to 5 Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones.Paul Tudor Jones, the founder of Tudor Investment Corp, believes that investors have moved on from the shareholder capitalism philosophy coined by Milton Friedman. He thinks that customers and investors are more interested in a corporation’s actions rather than its balance sheet’s strength. Actions related to the environment, safety, and governance (ESG) have taken center stage. The billionaire expressed these views in an interview with CNBC in January. Mr. Jones commented that if the intention of forming a business is to maximize profit, such businesses could lack a moral compass and would always prioritize profits over ethical policies. He discussed the example of Purdue Pharma and highlighted that the purpose of the pharmaceutical company was profit maximization first, which resulted in an opioid crisis in the US that took over 400,000 lives. Mr. Jones observed that the purpose of a business could not be truly judged without bringing ethics and morality into the conversation.Regarding the market outlook, Mr. Jones thinks that hot stocks will continue to face tough times. He opined that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell needs to review policies to fight the impact of inflation, which has run havoc on the value of assets across various classes. The Federal Reserve started raising the benchmark interest rates by 75 basis points (bps) on June 15. This was the most significant rate increase in the last 28 years. The Federal Reserve increased the interest rate to combat inflation, which has surged to a four-decade high. Mr. Jones believes that capital preservation should be the main focus of investors during such challenging times.Experts across Wall Street believe that the Federal Reserve can tip the economy into a recession by aggressive tightening schemes to control inflation. During these times, Mr. Jones prefers trend-following strategies. These strategies employ algorithmic models to highlight price trends in the market. Mr. Jones’ claim to fame is that he predicted the stock market crash of 1987 and generated a healthy return during the crash through his shrewd investing philosophy.Story continuesIn this article we focus on PTJ's first quarter stock picks and determine how they fared since then. Paul Tudor Jones’ Q1 2022 portfolio is valued at over $4.2 billion. The billionaire had stakes in popular companies like Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc.

We believe the current valuations of  the company is compelling. Further, we believe the company is well-positioned to benefit from long-term growth opportunities that include a growing list of companies looking to outsource their commercial real estate needs, the growth in institutional ownership of commercial real estate, and attractive acquisition opportunities given their highly desirable global platforms and strong balance sheets.”CBRE Group, Inc.

(NYSE:SWK) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Stanley Black &amp; Decker performed well through the first part of the year but struggled over the summer. China accounts for much of its production, and their zero-tolerance approach to pandemic safety measures has led to disruption, compounded by shipping difficulties and rising materials expenses.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Tudor Investment Corp’s Holdings: $11,476,000Percentage of Tudor Investment Corp’s Portfolio: 0.26%PE Ratio as of July 1: 10.53Return since June 30th: 2.7%The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) is a New York-based investment banking services corporation and is considered an important bank in the US financial system by the Federal Stability Board (FSB).On July 1, Gerard Cassidy at RBC Capital kept a Sector Perform rating on The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) with a price target of $49, reflecting a 15% upside potential. The analyst reduced the target price on The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) from $56 after lowering his FY22 EPS forecast from $4.68 to $4.36 and FY23 EPS forecast from $5.43 to $4.95. The analyst reduced the forecast to incorporate the current market conditions. Investment bank services companies like The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) are highly sensitive to interest rate changes as there will be a runoff on deposits due to rising interest rates.However, the company has solid business fundamentals. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) increased its quarterly dividend by 9.67% in July 2021 to $0.34 per share. The company’s dividend yield stands at 3.21% as of July 1. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) has increased its dividend for 11 consecutive years.Here’s what Ariel Investments said about The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Rising interest rates, after a surprisingly long period of low absolute rates and negative “real” rates, will create a headwind. While there has been much debate about the cause of these low rates, we believe the most important factor has been the $120 billion in monthly federal reserve open market bond purchases and the accumulation of an $8 trillion balance sheet. The former will end, and the latter will shrink. It is not just the Fed that has aggressively purchased bonds, bidding up prices and lowering yields. Bond traders and hedge fund managers have added to positions, confident that being on the same side as the Fed was the wise place to be. Now as the Fed is about to become a seller of bonds rather than a buyer, Wall Street’s “smart money” is likely to follow suit. Against this backdrop, fixed income securities and bond substitutes such as high dividend paying utilities and absolute return hedge funds are substantially overpriced and are not likely to produce attractive returns going forward.This expectation of a reversion to the mean for interest rates helped 2021 performance, though not as much as we had hoped. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury did indeed increase from +0.92% at the beginning of the year to +1.52% at year-end. An underreported story was the poor performance of bonds last year. The Barclays Aggregate Index declined -1.67% for the year ending December compared to a return of +28.71% for equities as measured by the S&amp;P 500. Interest rates have continued to climb in 2022 with the 10-year Treasury at +1.79% as we go to print. This move higher in rates has contributed to our good, early start to 2022. Smaller positions in The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) also benefited from higher rates, principally with their ability to invest customer cash.”The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) was held by 54 hedge funds as of Q1 2022.In addition to Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK), popular companies such as Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Safe Dividend Stocks with Over 3% Yield. Investors are flocking to dividend stocks this year amid the broader bloodbath that is crushing growth stocks. Dividend stocks that have a history of raising their payouts have become attractive as they provide some sort of security to investors who hungry for certainty as the Fed has no intention to slow interest rate hikes.Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal quoted Credit Suisse analysts, who said that high-dividend stocks have continued to outperform companies with lower payouts since 2020. The WSJ report also cited Max Wasserman, the founder of Miramar Capital, who said:“If I have a choice between you buying more of your stock or you giving me cash…I’d rather have the cash.""Analysts believe the popularity of dividend stocks is expected to continue into the next year as investors now prefer stocks that are paying stable payouts instead of growth companies that promise profits far into the future that is everything but certain. The same WSJ article mentioned that as of May 24, the S&amp;P 500 High Dividend index was up 3.6% this year, compared to a 13% decline for the S&amp;P 500 Buyback index in the same period.Beginner investors who have budget constraints are also piling into dividend ETFs, which provide more diversification and risk mitigation.Image by Steve Buissinne from PixabayMethodologyFor this article, we picked dividend stocks that have a yield of over 3% as of October 26.

(NASDAQ:WBA) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company’s progress.”8.

Then our free report on NVIDIA will help you uncover what's on the horizon.How Is NVIDIA's Growth Trending?NVIDIA's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 8.8%. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 176% overall rise in EPS, aided somewhat by its short-term performance. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 11% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.4% per year, which is not materially different.With this information, we find it interesting that NVIDIA is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.What We Can Learn From NVIDIA's P/E?While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesWe've established that NVIDIA currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for NVIDIA   you should know about.You might be able to find a better investment than NVIDIA.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 16, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.73 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -37.6%.Revenues are expected to be $5.99 billion, down 15.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.97% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nvidia?For Nvidia, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -9.68%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nvidia will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nvidia would post earnings of $0.56 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.51, delivering a surprise of -8.93%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Nvidia doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +26% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.3% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has gained 14.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.73 per share, indicating a change of -37.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.46 points to a change of -22.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.50 indicates a change of +30% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NVDA _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $5.99 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -15.7%. The $27.36 billion and $31.05 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.7% and +13.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNvidia reported revenues of $6.7 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3%. EPS of $0.51 for the same period compares with $1.04 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.7 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.03%. The EPS surprise was -8.93%.Over the last four quarters, Nvidia surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nvidia is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

BDX, McKesson MCK and AmerisourceBergen ABC.Industry: Dental SupplyLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2016074/3-dental-supplies-stocks-to-watch-amid-industry-headwindsThe COVID-19 pandemic — a biological crisis of unprecedented nature — altered the nature and dynamics of the healthcare industry. The Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry bore the brunt of the closure of dental practices and lower patient visits due to the risk of exposure to the virus. However, the dental market has experienced substantial recovery, primarily owing to the easing of prior restrictions and mass vaccinations. Apart from this, rising dependence on Artificial Intelligence (AI) &amp; Robotics and teledentistry and an increase in the number of patient visits are likely to help the industry thrive in the near term.However, inflationary, labor-shortage and supply-chain headwinds are hurting margins of the industry players. These headwinds are likely to continue in 2023, subduing earnings growth. Industry participants like Becton, Dickinson and Co. and McKesson, AmerisourceBergen have shown resilience despite uncertain conditions and are likely to gain from the existing opportunities.Industry DescriptionThis industry primarily comprises designers, developers, manufacturers and marketers of dental consumables, dental laboratory products and dental specialty items. Some of the industry participants also provide practice management and clinical software, patient education systems, and office forms and stationery. Dental stocks have been gaining significant attention post the weakness witnessed during the pandemic-induced disruptions.This space has continued to show signs of recovery and held its ground. Notably, dental care is being delivered safely, following the guidance and recommendations of the American Dental Association (“ADA”) and CDC. Backed by the rebound witnessed by the companies in this space, patient volume continues to see an encouraging increase despite the COVID-19 risks.Story continuesMajor Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Dental Supplies IndustryRising Dependence on Teledentistry: Following the COVID-19 outbreak, most dental practices were unable to offer routine services in the office. Teledentistry, which is a provision to offer dental services through interactive video, audio or other electronic media to provide consultation, diagnosis and treatment, helped clinicians and patients amid this crisis. Dependence on teledentistry is expected to continue even as the pandemic eases as it enhances patient care. The introduction of digital solutions has helped dental professionals to conduct video consultations with existing patients, thereby enhancing treatment efficiency.Digital Influence: The latest technologies help dentists in carrying out minimally-invasive procedures that ensure precision and efficiency, thereby reducing patients’ trauma. The industry players actively promote digital workflows for general dentistry and dental specialties. Further, dental 3D printers are revolutionizing dentistry. These reduce time and cost through efficient utilization of orthodontics and dental practices. In fact, dental 3D printers became mainstream in 2020.AI &amp; Robotics: AI has been shaping the dental industry for quite some time now. This decade is likely to see the rise of computing power, which has become more accessible and affordable for dental practitioners. It will transform the way dentists work, and patients receive treatment, especially with the introduction of robot dentists. Robots are now able to perform minimally-invasive dental work like filling cavities and extracting teeth. A report by National Business Capital &amp; Services suggests that AI dentistry had already become mainstream by 2019-end.Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Medical Dental Supplies industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector.It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #186, which places it in the bottom 26% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few dental supplies stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry PerformanceThe industry has outperformed its own sector in the past year as well as the S&amp;P 500 composite in the same time frame.Stocks in this industry have collectively declined 14.6% compared with the Zacks Medical sector’s decline of 20.9%. The S&amp;P 500 has declined 19.7% in the same time frame.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 16.59X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 16.9X and the sector’s 21.94X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 20.13X and as low as 13.39X, with the median being at 17.44X.3 Promising Dental Supplies StocksMcKesson: It is a health care services and information technology company. McKesson operates through two segments. The Distribution Solutions segment distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs along with other healthcare-related products worldwide. The segment also provides practice management, technology, clinical support and business solutions to community-based oncology and other specialty practices. In addition, the segment provides specialty pharmaceutical solutions for pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Technology Solutions segment provides enterprise-wide clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain and strategic management software solutions.Strong growth in U.S. markets, especially for pharmaceutical and specialty solutions, drove McKesson’s top line 5.4% year over year during the second quarter fiscal 2023 ending September. An increase in prescription from third-party logistics as well as higher technology services revenues also aided top-line growth. However, rising costs amid ongoing supply chain challenges continue to hurt margins. The company projects adjusted EPS in the range of $24.45 to $24.95 for fiscal 2023.For this San Francisco, CA-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues suggests growth of 4.3%, while the same for earnings indicates an increase of 4.5%. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.79%, on average. Presently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Becton, Dickinson and Co.: Becton, Dickinson and Company, commonly known as BD, is a medical technology company engaged principally in the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices, instrument systems and reagents. In its fourth quarter fiscal 2022 ending in September, the company is expected to achieve earnings growth of nearly 5.4%. BD’s Medical and Interventional segments are likely to continue their robust performance in the fiscal fourth quarter. However, its Life Sciences segment sales are likely to decline due to lower COVID-only testing.We note that BD generates a substantial amount of its revenues from international operations. The revenues BD reports with respect to its operations outside the United States may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. BD expects its fiscal year revenues to be in the range of $18.75 billion-$18.83 billion and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $11.28-$11.35. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).However, for this Franklin Lakes, NJ-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2022 revenues indicates a decline of 7.1%, while the same for earnings suggests a decline of 13.5%. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 11.85%, on average.AmerisourceBergen: It is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies, which focuses on providing drug distribution and related services to reduce health care costs and improve patient outcomes. Per management, its position as the leader in global specialty logistics services drove compelling volume growth and overall performance for the company. Strong organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, improving patient access to medical care, enhanced economic conditions and population demographics are likely to favor the company in the quarters to come.AmerisourceBergen’s top line gained 3.8% during the last reported quarter. It also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.5%. An increase in specialty product sales coupled with overall market growth drove the top line. However, lower revenues from commercial COVID-19 treatments are hurting the growth. The company expects total revenues to grow by 5-7% in fiscal 2023 and adjusted earnings by 2-5%.For this Chesterbrook, PA-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues and earnings suggests an increase of 3.9% and 4%, respectively. Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #3.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

McKesson operates through two segments. The Distribution Solutions segment distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs along with other healthcare-related products worldwide. The segment also provides practice management, technology, clinical support and business solutions to community-based oncology and other specialty practices. In addition, the segment provides specialty pharmaceutical solutions for pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Technology Solutions segment provides enterprise-wide clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain and strategic management software solutions.Strong growth in U.S. markets, especially for pharmaceutical and specialty solutions, drove McKesson’s top line 5.4% year over year during the second quarter fiscal 2023 ending September. An increase in prescription from third-party logistics as well as higher technology services revenues also aided top-line growth. However, rising costs amid ongoing supply chain challenges continue to hurt margins. The company projects adjusted EPS in the range of $24.45 to $24.95 for fiscal 2023.For this San Francisco, CA-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues suggests growth of 4.3%, while the same for earnings indicates an increase of 4.5%.

In its fourth quarter fiscal 2022 ending in September, the company is expected to achieve earnings growth of nearly 5.4%. BD’s Medical and Interventional segments are likely to continue their robust performance in the fiscal fourth quarter. However, its Life Sciences segment sales are likely to decline due to lower COVID-only testing.We note that BD generates a substantial amount of its revenues from international operations. The revenues BD reports with respect to its operations outside the United States may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. BD expects its fiscal year revenues to be in the range of $18.75 billion-$18.83 billion and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $11.28-$11.35.

Per management, its position as the leader in global specialty logistics services drove compelling volume growth and overall performance for the company. Strong organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, improving patient access to medical care, enhanced economic conditions and population demographics are likely to favor the company in the quarters to come.AmerisourceBergen’s top line gained 3.8% during the last reported quarter. It also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.5%. An increase in specialty product sales coupled with overall market growth drove the top line. However, lower revenues from commercial COVID-19 treatments are hurting the growth. The company expects total revenues to grow by 5-7% in fiscal 2023 and adjusted earnings by 2-5%.For this Chesterbrook, PA-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues and earnings suggests an increase of 3.9% and 4%, respectively.

Prior to that, the last time the stock closed at or below $86.75 was in 2015. Bears seized on the company’s much-lower-than-expected profit forecast as well as a significant undershooting of Wall Street expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter. Disney’s streaming business has proven a bright spot (Disney+ added 12.1 million subscribers to hit 164.2 million globally) but profitability is weighing on investors’ minds despite executives’ efforts to reassure them. Traditional businesses like linear TV are under significant pressure from cord-cutting.In a flurry of research notes, analysts debated the puts and takes from the earnings report and conference call with executives. Several of them slashed their stock price targets for the company, though they largely held steady with their recommendations to investors and didn’t issue downgrades based on the latest numbers.Story continuesMichael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson called the company’s forecast for fiscal 2023 segment earnings growth of high-single-digits, far below Wall Street’s consensus of 25% and his own outlook for 34% “the biggest controversy” in the financials. “Rarely have we ever been so incorrect in our forecasting of Disney profits,” the analyst wrote. “Given the company’s confidence that Parks trends appear resilient, it appears that the culprit for the massive earnings downgrade is much higher than expected DTC losses and significant declines at linear networks.” Nathanson, who maintains a “market perform” (neutral) rating on Disney shares, lowered his 12-month price target by $30, to $100.The winner for cheekiest headline goes to Michael Morris of Guggenheim, who nodded to Obi-Wan Kenobi’s Jedi mind trick in titling his Disney note “These Are Not The Results You’re Looking For.” He dropped his 12-month price target to $115 from $145, but still has a “buy” on Disney shares.Jessica Reif Ehrlich of BofA Securities conceded the quarter was “tough,” but she painted a brighter picture than many of her Street colleagues. She reiterated her “buy” rating on the stock, but trimmed her 12-month price target to $115 from $127.“The quarter and outlook were disappointing, but not as bad as headline numbers may suggest,” she wrote in a note to clients. “We believe underlying theme park demand remains healthy and the operating income miss is largely due to one-time items vs. moderating demand. In linear networks, Disney is experiencing many of the same headwinds other industry participants are facing, but we believe their iconic brands and scaled/growing DTC service position them well to better manage these headwinds and industry transitions relative to peers.”Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley expressed even more optimism than Ehrlich, affirming his “overweight” (buy) rating on Disney shares and setting a $125 price target. He characterized the lighter-than-expected revenue and profit guidance for fiscal 2023 as “primarily a function of margin pressure at legacy TV networks, with lower F4Q Parks &amp; Streaming results also contributing.” In a note to clients, Swinburne wrote, “We remain bullish the Parks segment growth outlook, continue to expect it will represent the majority of Disney’s EPS over time, and believe shares are undervaluing the Parks assets at current level.”Another notable bull was John Hodulik of UBS, who carries a “buy” rating on the company’s shares. While he did lower his price target to $122 from $135, he concluded, “While the macro environment presents challenges, we still view Disney as best positioned for the transition to a streaming future.”Amid the stock market drama Disney CEO Bob Chapek traveled to New York today.

The study is the first of its kind in the region.""Severe and destructive weather caused by climate change is already impacting our area, and this study gives us a preview of what’s to come – including warmer, more humid conditions that will pose new challenges to the power grid,"" said ComEd CEO Gil Quiniones. ""Our customers today enjoy record-setting reliability at one of the lowest rates in America; using this localized climate data, we can plan the grid investments necessary to ensure we continue to deliver reliable, resilient energy to our customers, even as the grid must handle more severe weather and increased demand due to decarbonization.""Electric delivery companies like ComEd need to manage the combined effects of climate-driven weather; changing grid uses through the electrification of transportation, buildings, and industry loads; and the growth of intermittent renewable and distributed generation. In collaboration with another ComEd-commissioned study on pathways to decarbonization in Illinois, Argonne has taken the first step toward a combined analysis of climate change mitigation and adaptation.Specifically, Argonne’s analysis shows that projected mid-century climate conditions for ComEd’s northern Illinois service territory are likely to be substantially warmer during all seasons and more humid than historical conditions. In particular, the area will experience more intense and prolonged heatwaves in summer months, which will be amplified by higher humidity. Measures of seasonal energy demand point to growth in demand for cooling, or air conditioner use, particularly during summer, late spring and early fall. In planning for future demand and resilience, the study also highlights the importance of accounting for the combined effects of climate change and electrification. Electric vehicles can add new load to summer peaks and electric heat pumps can shift peak electrical use into the winter.Story continuesThe study identifies risks to ComEd infrastructure and operations that result from changing climate conditions, including but not limited to; increased heat that will exceed the design limits of ComEd equipment like transformers and conductors and cause an increase in HVAC loads that have the potential for historically unprecedented system peaks; icing risk that is currently more prominent in central Illinois into the denser infrastructure of ComEd’s system, causing additional winter outage risks to customers; and increased density of vegetation increasing the risk of ComEd infrastructure damage. While current climate modeling is not able to accurately predict convection, a weather phenomenon that leads to intense storms with high winds, such as the destructive derecho that hit northern Illinois in August 2020, ComEd and Argonne are working together to study these processes to better understand how additional severe weather risk will manifest.Given expected climate impacts, Argonne has recommended several adaptation options for the ComEd grid, including, but not limited to, revising the design and construction standards to ensure ComEd equipment can withstand future climate conditions; adjusting vegetation management practices and standards to prevent more frequent contact with power lines; and increasing energy efficiency programs to alleviate projected stress on the grid.Phase two of the study, which will start in 2023, will examine the impacts to flood risk and convection, a weather phenomenon that causes severe storms with high winds and tornadoes.""This study shows how organizations can address the immediate challenges posed by climate-induced risks with Argonne’s one-of-a-kind climate modeling capabilities and knowledge of critical infrastructure,"" said Jordan Branham, Senior Climate Risk &amp; Resilience Analyst at Argonne.The collaboration between ComEd and Argonne builds upon established climate science and industry best practices to help ComEd plan and build infrastructure that is more resilient to the climate changes that pose growing risks to the grid. Argonne’s analysis of future climate conditions for Northern Illinois will help ComEd to select the most effective and efficient methods for adapting to these impacts, bringing new insights to ComEd’s industry-leading grid planning practices.As the nation’s electric companies are increasingly challenged by severe weather associated with climate change, ComEd is delivering the highest levels of service in its history to families and businesses. ComEd’s reliability performance for the first nine months of 2022 was highest on record for any year in company history. This strong performance would not be possible if not for smart grid improvements that began in 2011. At the same time, ComEd’s rates are among the lowest in America. As of December 2021, the average residential rate was 21 percent below the average for the nation’s top 10 metro areas, and as a percentage of median income, ComEd’s residential electricity charges rank among the lowest in the nation.ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 200 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

""That's why ComEd is teaming up with our partners at CACC to host a free forum to help answer key questions around how to navigate charging, rebates, rate plans and the latest options available on the market to help inform decision making and increase adoption across our communities.""Navigating the Journey to EVs, a free webinar held on Dec. 1, 2022 at 6 p.m., is designed to provide customers with information from industry experts that will help them make informed decisions about EVs. Those interested in attending can register today at https://NavigatingtheJourneytoEVs.eventbrite.com. The event will be posted on CACC’s website for those customers who are not able to attend the webinar but would like to view it later.Story continues""We know many consumers have been overwhelmed with information about EVs and that they do not want to sacrifice performance,"" said John Walton, chair, Chicago Area Clean Cities. ""This webinar will help give you the details that you need to confidently make the switch to driving electric. We’ll discuss electric vehicle charging, state and federal tax credits and incentives, workplace charging and answer your questions. It should give you great information to help you purchase your next vehicle.""During the webinar, find out more on what you need to know as you begin the journey to EVs, including:Overview of the benefits of driving an EV and current market optionsCurrent landscape of federal tax credits and state rebate programsCustomer resources to use to decide the right vehicle and charger for youHow to work with your utility to understand power availability before installing a charging stationLive questions answered at the end by experts!EVs provide a range of consumer savings and community health benefits, including significant savings at the pump, as EV engines draw 100% use of electricity, replacing the high cost of gasoline. For example, depending on vehicle type and driving mileage, transitioning to an EV can save a driver more than $2,000 a year on fuel costs. The savings to the customer are even more significant when considering the avoided operations and maintenance costs over the lifetime of the vehicle, as well as the air quality benefits that EVs provide.In recent years, federal and state governments have acted to lower financial barriers to new zero-emission technologies, including by offering rebates and federal tax credit programs to assist customers with the upfront purchase cost of EVs. The State of Illinois recently re-opened the EV Rebate program, offering residents an opportunity to apply to capture rebates of up to $4,000 for purchase of an electric vehicle, now through Jan. 31, 2023.In addition to customer outreach events like this, ComEd wants to make the transition to EVs as simple as possible for customers, and has launched an EV Toolkit – an all-in-one resource providing information and tips on currently available resources and rebates, rate plans and cost savings options, where to find charging stations, and more.Additionally, ComEd recently announced a new DOE funded grant to demonstrate extreme fast charging technology for EVs, as the time to fully charge an electric vehicle can be a deterrent to customers. While Level 2 chargers require approximately 7.5 hours to charge a standard 70kWh battery, these extreme fast chargers target reducing the time to fully charge a standard 70kWh battery to as little as 15 minutes.For more information on the benefits of EVs or to receive support from ComEd on an electrification project, customers are encouraged to visit our website or to reach out at EVsmart@comed.comAbout ComEd: ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 200 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

(OKE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oneok-inc-oke-attracting-investor-140002615.html,1668002402,STORY,['OKE'],"[Oneok Inc. (OKE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this natural gas company have returned +16.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.3% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Production Pipeline - MLB industry, to which Oneok belongs, has gained 8.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Oneok is expected to post earnings of $0.97 per share, indicating a change of +14.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.7% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.73 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +11.3%. This estimate has changed +3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.27 indicates a change of +14.4% from what Oneok is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Oneok is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for OKE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Oneok, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.03 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $23.99 billion and $23.1 billion estimates indicate +45% and -3.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOneok reported revenues of $5.91 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +30.4%. EPS of $0.96 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.52 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -9.28%. The EPS surprise was +3.23%.Over the last four quarters, Oneok surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Oneok is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Oneok. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

267,46b590ac-ead3-3986-807c-b8433fc9b7f3,HP,2022-11-10,Helmerich & Payne (HP) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/helmerich-payne-hp-earnings-expected-150003328.html,1668006003,STORY,['HP'],"[The market expects Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 16, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil and gas well-drilling contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +169.4%.Revenues are expected to be $591.35 million, up 72% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.68% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Helmerich &amp; Payne?For Helmerich &amp; Payne, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +14.32%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination indicates that Helmerich &amp; Payne will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Helmerich &amp; Payne would post earnings of $0.05 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.27, delivering a surprise of +440%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Helmerich &amp; Payne appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

270,7c0e0834-9bf6-410c-8b2d-98afa135df7b,NDAQ,2022-11-10,The games industry is facing a cold holiday season,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-holidays-wont-save-the-game-industrys-terrible-year-202939031.html,1668025779,STORY,"['MSFT', 'EA', 'SNEJF', 'SONY', 'NDAQ', 'TTWO', 'NTDOF', 'NTDOY']","[This article was first featured in Yahoo Finance Tech, a weekly newsletter highlighting our original content on the industry. Get it sent directly to your inbox every Wednesday by 4 p.m. ET. SubscribeWednesday, Nov. 9, 2022The holidays won't save the game industry from its terrible yearVideo game sales around the world have slumped in 2022, and experts predict that even the holiday shopping season won't rescue the industry from its terrible year.The pandemic lockdowns powered growth in video games last year and in 2020, as couch-bound gamers searched for a distraction from COVID-19. From 2019 to 2021, the global video game content and services market grew 26%, jumping from $151 billion to $191 billion, according to Ampere Analysis.That growth cooled in 2022, as the pandemic eased and the economy faltered. Microsoft (MSFT), Sony (SONY), EA (EA), and Take-Two (TTWO) each saw year-over-year sales declines. Nintendo (NTDOY) says it expects to sell 2 million fewer Switch consoles this year due to continued chip shortages, though it raised its sales forecast thanks to the weaker Japanese yen. Even mobile gaming sales are declining, with NPD Group predicting a 9% drop in the third quarter of 2023 from the same time a year earlier.While the holiday season traditionally brings huge game sales, experts predict a muted fourth quarter thanks to a lack of new, exciting content. We'd usually see hot titles for the holidays, but pandemic-related delays have pushed many games into 2023. Yes, the pandemic has eased enough to get people off of their couches — but it's still throwing snags in the supply chain. Those disruptions could strike a blow to an industry that's already suffering from year-over-year comparisons to its pandemic-driven highs in 2021.“This holiday season is set up to be a natural let-down just from a quantity perspective,” Jefferies analyst Andrew Uerkwitz told Yahoo Finance. “If you look at the number of games last year to this year, it's actually down. There's been over 100 games delayed over the last 24 months. And that's publicly announced delays.”Story continuesFew games, but plenty of eager gamersGame companies traditionally release their biggest titles in the lead-up to the holidays to get their hits out during the busiest shopping season of the year.A man walks an advertisement of Nintendo Switch at an electronics retail chain store in Tokyo on Oct. 13, 2021. (AP Photo/Koji Sasahara)Last year, the gaming giants fired off a host of big-name titles including “Halo Infinite,” “Battlefield 2042,” “Metroid Dread,” and “Call of Duty Vanguard” to name a few. While “Battlefield” and “Call of Duty” underperformed expectations, the titles were still among the best performing of the year in terms of U.S. sales. This year will be different.“As it happens, this holiday season we don't have a very big release schedule,” Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told Yahoo Finance. “There is no ‘Cyberpunk.’ There is no ‘Battlefield.’ We have the games that come out every year, which are ‘FIFA’ and ‘Call of Duty.’ ”“God of War Ragnarok” and “The Callisto Protocol,” two highly anticipated games that launch Wednesday and in December, respectively, could help improve sales, but there’s no guarantee that they’ll lift the entire industry.To be sure, people are still looking for games to play. Activision Blizzard’s “Call of Duty Modern Warfare II,” which came out in October, sold $1 billion worth of copies in its first 10 days on the market. Over at EA, some 10.3 million players jumped onto “FIFA 23” in the game’s first week of availability in September.Even so, EA cut its full-year net bookings forecast on the strong U.S. dollar, which is hurting overseas sales, from between $7.89 billion and $8.1 billion to between $7.65 billion and $7.85 billion.Activision Blizzard sold $1 billion worth of copies of 'Call of Duty' in 10 days this year. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong, File)Gamers will have to wait until next year to get their hands on new titles. According to Uerkwitz, more than 100 games that were initially scheduled to be released in time for the holiday season are delayed until sometime in 2023 either due to quality checks or because of COVID-related slowdowns.“And that's publicly announced delays,” Uerkwitz explained. “That's not games that quietly got delayed internally or whatnot. And so just a lack of quantity of high-profile AAA games I think has been a large part of the year-over-year decline in PC and console.”Then there’s the drop in mobile games sales. According to SensorTower, mobile game spending dropped 6% year-over-year to $21.1 billion in Q1 2022 and 6.9% year-over-year in Q2 to $20.1 billion.“The reason that 2022 will be down overall, isn't necessarily that consoles and PCs have had a rough year, although they had, it's because mobile gaming appears to be on track to drop 6% or 8%,” Lewis Ward, IDC research director of gaming, eSports and VR/AR, told Yahoo Finance. “If that happens, even if consoles and PCs had a great year, we could probably still be down year over year.”PS5 by PlayStation is displayed in a GameStop in Manhattan, New York, U.S., December 7, 2021. REUTERS/Andrew KellyThat doesn’t mean that the holiday season will be a complete bust. According to Pachter, if there is a year-over-year decline in sales, it will likely be somewhere in the 1% to 2% range. That said, even a small decline means that the overall downward sales trend for the year won’t change.A brighter 2023While the holiday season could be a let-down for the gaming industry, the year ahead should offer some relief despite high inflation and foreign exchange headwinds. That's because a large number of big-name games are expected to hit the market in 2023.“Assuming recessionary concerns dissipate, and inflation gets back under a reasonable level of control or back to a baseline norm of low single digits in 2023, the baseline that the gaming industry was on before COVID will probably reassert itself,” Ward explained.High-profile games set to launch in 2023 include Nintendo’s “Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,” Ubisoft’s “Skull and Bones,” Activision Blizzard’s “Diablo 4,” Bethesda’s “Starfield,” and a slew of others.Those titles alone will likely sell millions of units. Toss in annual releases like “Madden” and gamers dropping their cash on online games like “Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0,” and 2023 will look far better than gaming’s terrible 2022.By Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

271,7246bbd5-1990-3aad-82f5-4fe806f3d1b8,CL,2022-11-10,13 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks to Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-best-consumer-staples-dividend-162141293.html,1668010901,STORY,"['COST', 'CL', 'MDLZ', 'PEP', 'ADM', 'WMT', 'TGT', 'HSY', 'KO', 'PG']","[In this article, we will discuss 13 best consumer staples dividend stocks to buy now. You can skip our detailed analysis of the sector and its performance this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. The sizzling inflation and continuous interest rate hikes have taken nearly every sector into its fold this year. However, the consumer staples sector is performing better than the rest of the market because these companies exhibit strong demand for their products even during weak economic conditions. The growing demand gives the sector hedging capabilities against inflation, which makes investors pick these stocks over other risky industries. Some of the well-known names in the consumer staples sector include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP).Consumer staples companies benefitted a lot during the pandemic due to increased consumer spending, especially through digital channels. According to a report by JPMorgan, e-commerce represented 12% of gross sales in the first six months of 2020 and showed a 60% growth from the prior-year period (see the biggest e-commerce companies). The shift in the companies’ way of running businesses has further expanded the sector as people now have access to various online systems. This year’s returns have also shown that shares of the consumer staple companies have trounced their counterparts. The S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples index declined by 6.22% year-to-date, compared with a 29.6% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology index. Another report by Fidelity Investments shows that the consumer staples sector delivered a 14% annualized return in the last three years ending March 2022, compared with an 11% and 13.2% return for the energy and industrial sectors.Due to their non-cyclic nature, consumer staples have stable earnings, consistent cash flows, and strong balance sheets, which are very important from a dividend perspective. In the current market, investors prefer safe stocks that would help them to stay afloat and generate stable income. For this reason, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks in the sector.Story continues13 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks to Buy NowCopyright: jetcityimage / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are from the consumer staples sector and pay dividends to shareholders. We analyzed these stocks through their dividend policies, balance sheets, and overall fundamentals. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yields as of November 8.13. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Dividend Yield as of November 8: 0.73%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American multinational big-box store company. In October, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $525 with an Overweight rating on the shares, appreciating the company's unit growth and market share gains.In fiscal Q4 2022, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) reported revenue of $72 billion, which showed a 15% growth from the same period last year. The company ended the quarter with over $10.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Its total current assets amounted to over $32.6 billion, compared with $29.5 billion in the prior-year quarter.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 18 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks in the consumer staples sector. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share for a dividend yield of 0.73%, as of November 8.At the end of Q2 2022, 64 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), up from 61 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $4.76 billion. With stakes over $2 billion, Fisher Asset Management owned the largest position in the company in Q2.In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), investors are also paying attention to Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) due to its strong dividend policy.Cooper Investors mentioned Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”12. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Dividend Yield as of November 8: 1.56%Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail company that operates a chain of hypermarkets and grocery stores. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company maintains a 49-year track record of consistent dividend growth.

(NYSE:WMT) in October to $165 with a Buy rating on the shares, calling the company a value leader in retail. The firm mentioned that the company is well-positioned to benefit in the current environment.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was a popular buy among elite funds in Q2 2022, as 67 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned positions in it, up from 60 a quarter earlier. The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a total value of over $3.78 billion.Leaven Partners mentioned Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”11. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM)Dividend Yield as of November 8: 1.66%Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is an Illinois-based multinational food processing and commodities trading company.

The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a consolidated value of nearly $659 million.Diamond Hill Capital mentioned Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) in its Q1 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“ADM is a leading agricultural processor that also operates a global nutrition business focused on the development of ingredients and flavors for food and beverages, supplements and more. The company’s recent operating results have benefited (unfortunately) from the war in Ukraine as grain prices and agricultural markets globally experienced strong price increases. ADM is positioned well to benefit from the volatility due to its stable North American agricultural base.”10. The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY)Dividend Yield as of November 8: 1.78%The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) is one of the world's largest chocolate manufacturers that also specializes in other baked products. In Q3 2022, the company reported revenue of $2.73 billion, which showed a 15.7% growth from the same period last year. Its organic sales also grew by 11.8% during the quarter.

In November, Barclays raised its price target on the stock to $76 with an Equal Weight rating on the shares, highlighting the company's strong earnings in the recent quarter.For the first nine months of the year, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) reported an operating cash flow of over $1.88 billion.

These stakes have a total value of nearly $3 billion.Third Point mentioned Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its recently-published Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)7.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So on that note, DENTSPLY SIRONA (NASDAQ:XRAY) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for DENTSPLY SIRONA:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.077 = US$590m ÷ (US$8.9b - US$1.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).So, DENTSPLY SIRONA has an ROCE of 7.7%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.4%. View our latest analysis for DENTSPLY SIRONA roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for DENTSPLY SIRONA compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From DENTSPLY SIRONA's ROCE Trend?DENTSPLY SIRONA has not disappointed in regards to ROCE growth. We found that the returns on capital employed over the last five years have risen by 49%. That's a very favorable trend because this means that the company is earning more per dollar of capital that's being employed. Speaking of capital employed, the company is actually utilizing 24% less than it was five years ago, which can be indicative of a business that's improving its efficiency. DENTSPLY SIRONA may be selling some assets so it's worth investigating if the business has plans for future investments to increase returns further still.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In the end, DENTSPLY SIRONA has proven it's capital allocation skills are good with those higher returns from less amount of capital. Given the stock has declined 55% in the last five years, this could be a good investment if the valuation and other metrics are also appealing. So researching this company further and determining whether or not these trends will continue seems justified.Before jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

Management and advisory fees based on committed capital are not affected by market appreciation or depreciation.

(MU) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-technology-inc-mu-attracting-140002572.html,1668002402,STORY,['MU'],"[Micron (MU) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this chipmaker have returned +7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.3% change. The Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, to which Micron belongs, has gained 8.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Micron is expected to post earnings of $0.04 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -98.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $0.18 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -97.8%. This estimate has changed +2.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.53 indicates a change of +1,859.9% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -10.6%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Micron is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MU _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Micron, the consensus sales estimate of $4.29 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -44.2%. The $19.43 billion and $26.7 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -36.8% and +37.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicron reported revenues of $6.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.7%. EPS of $1.45 for the same period compares with $2.42 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -4.03%. The EPS surprise was +3.57%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Micron is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Micron. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Brands (NYSE:YUM) Aren't Growing,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-yum-brands-nyse-yum-124008222.html,1668084008,STORY,['YUM'],"[If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Looking at Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), it does have a high ROCE right now, but lets see how returns are trending.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Yum! Brands:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.46 = US$2.1b ÷ (US$5.8b - US$1.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Yum! Brands has an ROCE of 46%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Hospitality industry average of 9.8%. See our latest analysis for Yum! Brands roceIn the above chart we have measured Yum! Brands' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Yum! Brands.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsThings have been pretty stable at Yum! Brands, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. Although current returns are high, we'd need more evidence of underlying growth for it to look like a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why Yum! Brands is paying out 48% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Yum! Brands' ROCEIn summary, Yum! Brands isn't compounding its earnings but is generating decent returns on the same amount of capital employed. Since the stock has gained an impressive 68% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.Yum! Brands does come with some risks though, we found 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 2 of those are a bit concerning...If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

My graduate school teachers would describe me as thoughtful and sincere.""What did you want to be when you grew up?In school, I was adept at debating and so dreamt of being a lawyer, but I soon realized that the profession wasn't entirely as it was portrayed in Hollywood.I then shifted my sights toward becoming a high school teacher or football coach as I loved team sports and working with others.I ended up in the business world after I accepted an internship at Procter &amp; Gamble simply because I had a 1983 Mazda RX7 that I couldn't afford to fix and it paid $500 weekly, including a company car!WORKFirst job | My first time getting paid was for a paper route in the fourth grade. My first ""real job"" was as an office assistant in the summer after my freshman year of high school.Procter &amp; Gamble1992: Sales Intern, Laundry, St. Louis, Missouri1993 - 1994: Account Manager, Foodservice ision, St. Louis, Missouri1995 - 1996: Technology Account Executive, Innovation Team, Cincinnati, Ohio1996 - 1997: Assistant Brand Manager, Food and Beverage, Cincinnati, Ohio1998 - 1999: Category Account Executive, Office Coffee Services, Cincinnati, Ohio2000 - 2001: Key Account Executive and Channel Manager, Coffee Services, Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaStory continuesMercer Management Consulting2002: Strategy Consultant, New York CityBain &amp; Company2003 - 2004: Consultant, Dallas, Texas2005: Case Team Leader, Dallas, Texas2006 - 2007: Manager, Dallas, TexasKimberly-Clark2007 - 2008: Strategy Director, Dallas, Texas2008 - 2009: Strategy Director, Asia-Pacific, Hong Kong2010 - 2012: General Manager, Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine2013 - 2014: Managing Director, Turkey, Istanbul, Turkey2014 - 2015: Vice President, Central and Eastern Europe, Moscow, Russia2016 - 2017: President, North American Professional, Atlanta, Georgia2018: President, Consumer, Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa, London, United Kingdom2018 - 2019: Global President, Professional, Atlanta, Georgia2020 - 2021: President, Consumer, Asia-Pacific, SingaporePizza Hut2021 - present: Global Chief Executive Officer, Plano, TexasWhat moments, or who, in your life have shaped the way you work?Meeting and marrying my wife Suzette | I was blessed with some natural talents which got me through, but, marrying Suzette, becoming a father, and her belief in me, changed my idea about trying to live life (personally and professionally) to its fullest.For example, while at Procter &amp; Gamble, I was doing well but feeling ready to take on a new challange. Suzette encouraged me to figure out what I really wanted and to go for it. I took her advice and this desire for a new diredtion as an opportunity to go back to school for my MBA. We went from two incomes ( she was a paralegal about to give birth to our first daughter) to no incomes as I went back to graduate school full-time. This wasn't a rational decision. This was about belief in the future that we could create for our family, and I would have never considered such a move without Suzette.Stan Gohlinghorst | A large influence on me as a leader was my second manager at Procter and Gamble. Stan had 40 years of experience at the company, and I was just 22 years old. I still use his leadership lessons on how to treat people and customersas well as how to things the right way. My two years with him as my coach were invaluable.2014 Russian Financial Crisis | When the ruble's devaluation hit Eastern Europe, I was leading a team at Kimberly-Clark. Through this economic downturn, I learned that with the right mindset and teamwork, anything was possible. We created a completely new operating plan with the stated goal of doing big things, so that everyone had a job. The team crushed it by delivering great results and experienced no layoffs, despite the bleak outlook in the macroenvironment.Do you believe in work/life balance?I absolutely believe in work/life balance and that it takes a real, inidualized effort to get it done.For me, I am quite intentional. My laptop is barely open on the weekend, and I almost 100% unplug on vacations.On the other hand, I will sqeeze out as much productivity and output as is humanly possible while I am working. People are generally suprised by hoow full I will pack things in on business trips without doing any sightseeing or having any downtime, but that is 100%, so that I can get home to be with my family.My belief is: to each their own to figure out what works. Be intentional and purposeful.What do people think you do versus what you actually do?Having been a general manager since 2010, what I actually do is 50% people related: coaching, one-on-ones, problem-solving to help people get to an answer, interacting and meeting different people to form relationships, etc. The only way to really have impact is to ensure that the right people are in the right roler and have the right tone and context. What I don't do are big a-ha moments of strategy. I enable others to make decisions by helping to define the sandbox (boundaries) and set the tone.In what wats does technology play a role in your work?I am absolutely paranoid about becoming obsolete, and this is particularly true about technology. So, I really try to spend my free time reading and learning about technology. I don't want to mislead; I am not a technophile. But I make it a point, to get on Twitter, Instagram and TikTok. I have a VR headset. I have made myself observe Twitch. I take it as something fully in my control to stay as current as possible for as long as possible.What is the best piece of advice that you've been given?In the context of career devolpment, ""know thyself"" is great advice. I like the way the 1990s rap group 3rd Bass say it in their song ""Sons of 3rd Bass,"" ""He is stupid, but he knows that he is stupid and that almost makes him smart."" I think knowing what you are good at, your blind spots and what you need to get to your peak performance is quite important.What makes you happy?I am much more casual, low-key and informal than some may think of me. I love the simple moments like reading a book next to my wife on our patio or listening to live music at a hole-in-the-wall venue or teaching our oldest daughter how to play a song on the guitar.Professionally, nothing makes me happier than seeing an individualual grow and thrive.How do you do it?I was once told that all anyone really wants in a job is ""interesting work with people they like."" I believe that anything is possible. What really motivates me is being a part of something where people are positively affected. So, I try to accomplish that by focusing on real work that can make a real difference. I don't stew in negative enviroment where we attack inaction.Said differently, I think that the concept of ""interesting work"" is something in which - almost all cases - the motivated person can make interesting. Life is too short to let two years pass without growing enjoying yourself.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Yum! Brands on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Yum!

Getting kids interested in the stock market and then investing in different firms might be the perfect way to do that. For children, it is perhaps best to get started with big brands that are household names. Some of these, like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), are likely to be safe investments for kids as they start learning about the market. This is also an excellent time to buy these stocks as they are on sale and are likely to deliver positive returns over the long-term.Kids usually pick up financial habits from their parents, and these stocks are some of the best investments for adults as well. Children can learn about budgeting, saving, and investing as they experiment with stocks. Investing takes a good amount of sacrifice and patience as well, both traits that are critical for the development of kids. One of the best possible gifts that a parent can give their child is money management lessons and investing in the stock market is a fun way of delivering such a gift.  Our MethodologyThe companies that make products for children were selected for the list. The analyst ratings of these firms and the latest updates related to them are also discussed to provide some additional context. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.12 Best Kid-Friendly Stocks to Buy NowPixabay/Public DomainBest Kid-Friendly Stocks to Buy Now12.

(NASDAQ:FNKO), compared to 20 in the preceding quarter worth $161 million. Just like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Funko, Inc.

The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43     The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) engages in the manufacture and sale of confectionery products and pantry items in the United States and internationally.

The business enjoyed strong engagement last year with players of EA games spending 20% more time than even during 2020, helped by the delayed sales of the PS5 console. A potentially important development is the ongoing negotiation between EA and FIFA regarding the licensing of the FIFA brand for the EA football game. Strongly worded public statements have been slung from both parties as part of the negotiation process, but this could certainly be an opportunity for EA.”9. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50     McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) operates and franchises McDonald's restaurants around the world. It is one of the elite kid-friendly stocks to invest in 2022.

On October 18, Engine No. 1, a sustainability-focused investment firm, held talks with Coca-Cola on the subject of recycling bottles and cans.On October 26, UBS analyst Peter Grom maintained a Buy rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stock and raised the price target to $68 from $63, highlighting that company's Q3 earnings were impressive as its organic growth more than offset incremental currency headwinds.   At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $28 billion in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 64 in the preceding quarter worth $29 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”7. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65  CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) provides health services in the United States. On November 1, Walgreens Boots, Walmart and CVS health revealed that they have reached a tentative agreement to pay more than $12 billion for the sale of opioid painkillers to states and local governments. CVS will pay $4.9 billion, Walgreens minimum $4 billion and Walmart will pay $3 billion.On October 20, BofA analyst Michael Cherny maintained a Buy rating on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) stock and lowered the price target to $118 from $122, noting that the company expects Q3 results to be generally steady with well-understood near-term tailwinds and headwinds.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Connecticut-based investment firm AQR Capital Management is a leading shareholder in CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) with 3.4 million shares worth more than $312.7 million.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Vltava Fund, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”6. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109     The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) together with its subsidiaries, operates as an entertainment company worldwide. On November 1, Walt Disney was testing building stronger connections between its streaming and product business, by setting up a pilot program to offer exclusive toy selections to Disney and subscribers.On October 26, KeyBanc analyst Brandon Nispel maintained an Overweight rating on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock and lowered the price target to $143 from $154, noting that the company’s traditional Media business is exposed to negative macro trends, but focus on sports positions it favorably.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 109 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $3.2 billion in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), compared to 113 in the previous quarter worth $5.2 billion.In addition to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the best kid-friendly stocks to buy now according to elite investors. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Oakmark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the most beloved consumer companies in the world. Its media business has a rich library of intellectual property, which provides a powerful engine for creating new content across the Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars brands. This content also contributes to the success of Disney’s theme parks, which generated nearly half the company’s earnings and grew more than 10% annually in the decade before the pandemic. Shares have fallen nearly 50% over the past year as investors worried about the company’s ability to transition its media business to a direct-to-consumer streaming world. This transition has required management to make investments in its Disney+ streaming service that are depressing profitability today. However, we believe these investments will ultimately produce attractive returns as Disney+ continues to grow subscribers and increase pricing over time. As a result, we were able to purchase shares at a substantial discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Kid-Friendly Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested Articles:10 Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look Back12 Best Reddit Stocks To Invest In12 Best Financial Dividend Stocks to Invest InDisclosure.

If you want to skip our industry analysis, you can go straight to the Top 5 Restaurant Stocks Under $10.The restaurant industry is showing signs of recovery as the ease in inflation levels and fall in gas prices is helping restore consumers’ purchasing power. In September, same-store sales for restaurants grew by 5.2% YoY. The significance of the US restaurant industry can be gauged by the fact that it accounts for 4% of the US GDP as opposed to a contribution of 3% and 2%, respectively, by the automobile and fashion industries. However, the restaurant industry is also struggling to match the increase in demand for its services. The US food service industry employs 14.9 million workers as of 2022 and is still facing labor shortages as the COVID-19 pandemic caused numerous workers to leave the industry and pursue opportunities in sectors that were less impacted by the pandemic. The labor shortage has also led some leading companies to trim their working hours by 7.5% or 6.4 hours per week compared to the pre-pandemic data.To keep up with consumer preferences, restaurants are rapidly adapting to changing industry trends. The best restaurant stocks such as McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE:YUM), and Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) have actively capitalized on the advancements in technology in the industry. Overall, 42% of all orders are now accepted through the online channel. The online medium gained pace during the COVID-19 pandemic, and despite the ease of the pandemic, customer preferences have not changed. Furthermore, 79% of customers think that technological advancement has enhanced their restaurant experience. The integration of social media with online ordering, along with inventions like self-ordering kiosks, has paved a new way for customers to enjoy food from their favorite restaurants at their convenience. Food ordering through an online medium has increased by 135% since June 2020.Story continuesBest Restaurant Stocks To Buy Under $10Photo by shawnanggg on Unsplash Our MethodologyIn order to come up with our list of the best restaurant stocks to buy under $10, we have analyzed the growth drivers for each of these stocks to gauge the potential upside they can offer to investors in the long run.

Real estate stocks are one of the great investments of all time due to the high dividend yields compared to other stocks since these companies are required to give back 90% of their profits to the investors as dividends.The rapid rise of work-from-home trends around the world amid the COVID-19 pandemic affected the property sector. Despite this, a study by PWC reported that the industry continues to demonstrate its resilience by maintaining liquidity in capital markets. Real estate stocks were one of the top-performing sectors in S&amp;P 500 with a total return of +46.2% last year. This is projected to improve this 2022 as things are returning to normal.The leading subsector under REITs based on the Emerging Trends survey is the industrial/distribution subsector as it shows substantial investment and development prospects. Some of the stocks listed under this subsector are Americold Realty Trust (NYSE:COLD), STAG Industrial (NYSE:STAG), and Alpine Income Property Trust, Inc. (NYSE:PINE). Companies such as Essential Properties Realty Trust (NYSE:EPRT), Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.

Besides supplying aftermarket parts, PACCAR also offers finance and leasing services.PACCAR Trucks distributes premium trucks under the Kenworth and Peterbilt nameplates in the United States and Canada. The company operates in the European light/medium market under the DAF nameplate through its wholly owned subsidiary, Leyland, in the U.K.Strong Quarter Boosts EstimatesPACCAR's earnings of $2.21 per share for third-quarter 2022 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01 and rocketed 109% from the year-ago figure. Higher-than-expected pretax income from Trucks, Parts and Financial Services segments resulted in the outperformance.Consolidated revenues (including trucks and financial services) came in at $7.059 billion, up from $5.146B recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2021. Sales from Trucks, Parts and Others were $6.687B, which marginally missed the consensus mark of $6.692B.Responding to this strength, analysts raised this year's consensus from EPS of $7.73 to $8.15, based primarily on the big quarter beat.What's more important is that they boosted next year's EPS consensus from $8.04 to $8.36.Key Quarter TakeawaysRevenues from the Trucks segment totaled $5.198B in the September quarter, higher than the prior-year quarter’s $3.453B. The figure, however, missed the consensus mark of $5.313B. The segment’s pre-tax income was $430.5 million, surpassing the consensus mark of $385 million and increasing a whopping 438% year over year.Revenues from the Parts segment totaled $1.472B in the reported quarter, increasing from the year-earlier period’s $1.260B and surpassing the consensus mark of $1.431B. The segment’s pre-tax income came in at $374 million, up 32.6% on a yearly basis. The metric also outpaced the consensus mark of $353 million.Revenues of the Financial Services segment declined to $372 million from the year-earlier quarter’s $409 million but came in line with the consensus estimate. Pre-tax income rose to $146 million from $120 million and came higher than the consensus mark of $142 million.Drivers of GrowthThe reasons that have PCAR pushing over 21% topline growth this year to cross $26 billion -- and stunning 53% EPS growth -- are the combination of rising commodity prices, demand for vehicles, and robust economic activity globally.While the stock sits near 52-week highs, it's still quite the value, trading at only 1.3 times sales.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Paccar has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Tesla has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that PCAR likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than TSLA has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.PCAR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.33, while TSLA has a forward P/E of 47.19. We also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 1.23. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 1.50.Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P/B ratio of 2.71. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TSLA has a P/B of 14.84.These metrics, and several others, help PCAR earn a Value grade of A, while TSLA has been given a Value grade of C.PCAR has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than TSLA, so it seems like value investors will conclude that PCAR is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

300,bd3fe946-2da9-3314-b8d2-0b106d4ee128,PCAR,2022-11-10,Institutional investors control 66% of PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) and were rewarded last week after stock increased 3.7%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-control-66-paccar-135052680.html,1668001852,STORY,['PCAR'],"[A look at the shareholders of PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 66% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Last week’s 3.7% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. One-year return to shareholders is currently 18% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about PACCAR. Check out our latest analysis for PACCAR ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PACCAR?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.PACCAR already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see PACCAR's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. PACCAR is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.0% and 4.1%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of PACCARWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.We can see that insiders own shares in PACCAR Inc. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$621m. Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 32% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over PACCAR. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand PACCAR better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance.

After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put NetApp, Inc. NTAP stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, NetApp has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.64, as you can see in the chart below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis level actually compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&amp;P 500 stands at about 17.32. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, NetApp’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.12. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe should also point out that NetApp has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 12.66, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for NetApp stock in the near term too.Story continuesP/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, NetApp has a P/S ratio of about 2.41. This is lower than the S&amp;P 500 average, which comes in at 3.48 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf anything, NTAP is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, NetApp currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes NetApp a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though NetApp might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of B. This gives NTAP a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here &gt;&gt;)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current fiscal quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the fiscal full year estimate has seen one upward and one downward revision in the same time period.As a result, the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has been unchanged in the past two months, while the fiscal full year estimate has inched up by 0.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:NetApp, Inc. Price and ConsensusNetApp, Inc. Price and ConsensusNetApp, Inc. price-consensus-chart | NetApp, Inc. QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineNetApp is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 19% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall.

303,b7ca0354-7ec5-3d62-862d-5a0c9ec19121,NI,2022-11-10,Wall Street Analysts See a 30% Upside in NiSource (NI): Can the Stock Really Move This High?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-see-30-145502406.html,1668005702,STORY,"['TGT', 'NIMC']","[NiSource (NI) closed the last trading session at $24.93, gaining 0.2% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $32.50 indicates a 30.4% upside potential.The average comprises six short-term price targets ranging from a low of $30 to a high of $34, with a standard deviation of $1.76. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 20.3% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 36.4% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in NI. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for NIHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why NI Could Witness a Solid UpsideAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month, as one estimate has gone higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, NI currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much NI could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:RMD) recently. The pleasing results would be something shareholders would keep in mind at the upcoming AGM on 17 November 2022. It is likely that the focus will be on company strategy going forward as shareholders hear from the board and cast their votes on resolutions such as executive remuneration and other matters. In light of the great performance, we discuss the case why we think CEO compensation is not excessive. View our latest analysis for ResMed How Does Total Compensation For Mick Farrell Compare With Other Companies In The Industry?According to our data, ResMed Inc. has a market capitalization of US$31b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth US$12m over the year to June 2022. We note that's an increase of 12% above last year. While we always look at total compensation first, our analysis shows that the salary component is less, at US$1.1m.For comparison, other companies in the industry with market capitalizations above US$8.0b, reported a median total CEO compensation of US$13m. From this we gather that Mick Farrell is paid around the median for CEOs in the industry. Furthermore, Mick Farrell directly owns US$91m worth of shares in the company, implying that they are deeply invested in the company's success.Component20222021Proportion (2022)SalaryUS$1.1mUS$1.1m9%OtherUS$11mUS$9.3m91%Total CompensationUS$12mUS$10m100%Talking in terms of the industry, salary represented approximately 18% of total compensation out of all the companies we analyzed, while other remuneration made up 82% of the pie. ResMed pays a modest slice of remuneration through salary, as compared to the broader industry. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance.ceo-compensationA Look at ResMed Inc.'s Growth NumbersOver the past three years, ResMed Inc. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) grow by 22% per year. It achieved revenue growth of 8.2% over the last year.Story continuesThis demonstrates that the company has been improving recently and is good news for the shareholders. It's nice to see revenue heading northwards, as this is consistent with healthy business conditions. Looking ahead, you might want to check this free visual report on analyst forecasts for the company's future earnings..Has ResMed Inc. Been A Good Investment?Boasting a total shareholder return of 49% over three years, ResMed Inc. has done well by shareholders. As a result, some may believe the CEO should be paid more than is normal for companies of similar size.To Conclude...The company's solid performance might have made most shareholders happy, possibly making CEO remuneration the least of the matters to be discussed in the AGM. Instead, investors might be more interested in discussions that would help manage their longer-term growth expectations such as company business strategies and future growth potential.CEO compensation is a crucial aspect to keep your eyes on but investors also need to keep their eyes open for other issues related to business performance. That's why we did some digging and identified 1 warning sign for ResMed that investors should think about before committing capital to this stock.Arguably, business quality is much more important than CEO compensation levels.

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Mondelez International Is Mondelez International Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.70bUS$4.14bUS$4.45bUS$4.92bUS$5.27bUS$5.56bUS$5.80bUS$6.02bUS$6.21bUS$6.39bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 7.02%Est @ 5.51%Est @ 4.45%Est @ 3.71%Est @ 3.19%Est @ 2.83% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1% US$3.5kUS$3.7kUS$3.7kUS$3.9kUS$3.9kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$37bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.4b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.0%) = US$159bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$159b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$88bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$125b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$63.4, the company appears quite undervalued at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mondelez International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Mondelez International, we've put together three additional aspects you should consider:Risks: As an example, we've found 3 warning signs for Mondelez International (1 is potentially serious!) that you need to consider before investing here.Future Earnings: How does MDLZ's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

You can skip our detailed analysis of the sector and its performance this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. The sizzling inflation and continuous interest rate hikes have taken nearly every sector into its fold this year. However, the consumer staples sector is performing better than the rest of the market because these companies exhibit strong demand for their products even during weak economic conditions. The growing demand gives the sector hedging capabilities against inflation, which makes investors pick these stocks over other risky industries. Some of the well-known names in the consumer staples sector include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP).Consumer staples companies benefitted a lot during the pandemic due to increased consumer spending, especially through digital channels. According to a report by JPMorgan, e-commerce represented 12% of gross sales in the first six months of 2020 and showed a 60% growth from the prior-year period (see the biggest e-commerce companies). The shift in the companies’ way of running businesses has further expanded the sector as people now have access to various online systems. This year’s returns have also shown that shares of the consumer staple companies have trounced their counterparts. The S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples index declined by 6.22% year-to-date, compared with a 29.6% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology index. Another report by Fidelity Investments shows that the consumer staples sector delivered a 14% annualized return in the last three years ending March 2022, compared with an 11% and 13.2% return for the energy and industrial sectors.Due to their non-cyclic nature, consumer staples have stable earnings, consistent cash flows, and strong balance sheets, which are very important from a dividend perspective. In the current market, investors prefer safe stocks that would help them to stay afloat and generate stable income. For this reason, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks in the sector.Story continues13 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks to Buy NowCopyright: jetcityimage / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are from the consumer staples sector and pay dividends to shareholders. We analyzed these stocks through their dividend policies, balance sheets, and overall fundamentals. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yields as of November 8.13. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Dividend Yield as of November 8: 0.73%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American multinational big-box store company. In October, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $525 with an Overweight rating on the shares, appreciating the company's unit growth and market share gains.In fiscal Q4 2022, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) reported revenue of $72 billion, which showed a 15% growth from the same period last year. The company ended the quarter with over $10.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Its total current assets amounted to over $32.6 billion, compared with $29.5 billion in the prior-year quarter.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 18 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks in the consumer staples sector. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share for a dividend yield of 0.73%, as of November 8.At the end of Q2 2022, 64 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), up from 61 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $4.76 billion. With stakes over $2 billion, Fisher Asset Management owned the largest position in the company in Q2.In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), investors are also paying attention to Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) due to its strong dividend policy.Cooper Investors mentioned Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”12.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)7.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Beauty Stocks To Buy Now. In times of economic downturns, the beauty industry remains resilient, as consumers still like to splurge on beauty and skincare regimen, even if it might be in moderation. In 2022, consistently high inflation has tampered with impulsive purchases of beauty and personal care products. In the 12 months to October 1, 2022, there was a 2.1% decline in the sale of face care products in the United States, although higher prices made up for the lower volume. Similarly in Europe, over one in five customers are forecasted to allocate less money to their make-up and skincare products in the near future, as per research from McKinsey. For huge beauty companies, having a diversified range of products at multiple price points has helped deal with the economic slowdown. In better economic times, premiumization in skincare and haircare has proven to be a consumer favorite, displaying superior growth. This is why firms like Unilever, whose prestige beauty segment posted double-digit growth in the third quarter of 2022, are experimenting with premium beauty products. Some of the best beauty stocks to consider in order to benefit from the defensive nature of the sector include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), and The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL). Our Methodology We selected the following beauty stocks based on growth fundamentals, positive analyst coverage, and strong market visibility.

Inspired by the growing demand for hygiene products, the Lifebuoy brand of soaps was launched to ‘make health infectious’. 128 years later the Lifebuoy brand continues as a leading soap brand – albeit without the coal tar-derived ingredients list. In fact, the market research firm Kantar ranked Lifebuoy as the global #3 most chosen FMCG brand in 2020, just below Coca-Cola (KO) and Colgate (CL) – an astonishing fact given the age of the brand. While the brand is largely absent from shelves here in the UK, it is a juggernaut in Asian markets, and is the #1 brand in India.There are two observations about the Lifebuoy story which tell us a lot about Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL), which is currently our largest holding in the Fund.The first is the enduring power of brands in the consumer goods market. According to Kantar’s list of most chosen brands, the top 20 global marques have an average age of 116 years, with over half being founded in the 19th century. Fashions come and go, but there is something special about low-cost consumable goods that advantages strong, time-worn brand names…” (Click here to view full text)9. e.l.f. Beauty, Inc.

The company also operates a broad distribution network and holds a deep intellectual property portfolio across key categories within the cosmetic and fragrance industries. Additionally, Coty is building momentum around a business transformation that’s in the early innings but has already seen success in e-commerce and direct-to-consumer gains, as well as a rising presence in China.”6. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is a general merchandise retailer in the United States that sells beauty products through its Target Beauty segment. On October 18, Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe upgraded Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $185, up from $170. Amid a ""challenging macroeconomic backdrop,"" a ""subdued"" valuation and advancements in supply chain and inventory support a bullish call on Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), the analyst told investors in a research note. The analyst believes the second half of 2022 risk exists but noted that 2023 will possibly bring  improved margins. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is better positioned than the broader retail sector currently, added the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 46 hedge funds were bullish on Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 50 funds in the last quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 2.6 million shares worth $369.4 million. Like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), and The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), elite hedge funds are backing Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) as a potential play in the beauty sector. Here is what LRT Capital Management specifically said about Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operates retail stores that sell a variety of merchandise ranging from necessities such as food and hygiene products to discretionary products like children’s toys and electronics. The sale of this merchandise is done primarily through physical retail locations in all 50 US states. However, Target also sells its merchandise digitally through its online website which delivers merchandise to its customers in three ways: order pickup, drive up, and “Shipt”. The Target Corporation operates a single segment through 1,926 physical stores.Target is one of the largest US brick-and-mortar retailers and has successfully adapted to the competitive environment in the age of Amazon. As of 7/15/2022, TGT shares are down 36% for the year and down 44% since their all-time-high last year. The business is experiencing issues that are temporary in nature and we believe that the shares present an attractive opportunity at current prices. Target performed exceptionally well during the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath. Unfortunately, the company was recently caught flat footed, as consumer preferences shifted towards more spending on services (such as travel), at the expense of physical goods. As a result, the company found itself with an excess of inventory which will likely pressure margins in the next few quarters. Target is not alone in this predicament as many retailers such as Walmart and Best Buy have experienced similar issues over the last few months. The Covid-19 pandemic created enormous difficulties for retailers in forecasting demand and appropriate inventory levels. Clearing excess inventory will pressure margins in the short-term, and while this is a clear negative for the company, we do not believe it detracts from the long-term attractiveness of the business. Target shares are currently “on sale” due to increased uncertainty about near-term operating margins – this we believe is an opportunity.Weak consumer sentiment, a slowing economy, recession fears, along with a list of other problems have called Target’s margins and short-term profitability into question. Until the most recent earnings calls, Target and many other retailers were seeing record margins and consumer demand. This led to oversupplying of inventory with a now weaker consumer and that is temporarily damaging the operating metrics of Target and similar retailers. Target’s margins are among the highest in the retail industry, and although it will take a hit in the coming quarters the company’s operating margin will likely return to roughly 7% in the longer term…” (Click here to read the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Beauty Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:11 Best Bitcoin Stocks To BuyGoldman Sachs Dividend Stocks10 Undervalued European Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Best Beauty Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), by way of a worked example.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola is:41% = US$10.0b ÷ US$24b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.41 in profit.Does Coca-Cola Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Coca-Cola has a superior ROE than the average (15%) in the Beverage industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Coca-Cola by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Coca-Cola's Debt And Its 41% Return On EquityCoca-Cola does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.69. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

This is also an excellent time to buy these stocks as they are on sale and are likely to deliver positive returns over the long-term.Kids usually pick up financial habits from their parents, and these stocks are some of the best investments for adults as well. Children can learn about budgeting, saving, and investing as they experiment with stocks. Investing takes a good amount of sacrifice and patience as well, both traits that are critical for the development of kids. One of the best possible gifts that a parent can give their child is money management lessons and investing in the stock market is a fun way of delivering such a gift.  Our MethodologyThe companies that make products for children were selected for the list.

We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”7. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65  CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) provides health services in the United States. On November 1, Walgreens Boots, Walmart and CVS health revealed that they have reached a tentative agreement to pay more than $12 billion for the sale of opioid painkillers to states and local governments.

Here is what the fund said:“CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”6.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the best kid-friendly stocks to buy now according to elite investors. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Oakmark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the most beloved consumer companies in the world. Its media business has a rich library of intellectual property, which provides a powerful engine for creating new content across the Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars brands. This content also contributes to the success of Disney’s theme parks, which generated nearly half the company’s earnings and grew more than 10% annually in the decade before the pandemic. Shares have fallen nearly 50% over the past year as investors worried about the company’s ability to transition its media business to a direct-to-consumer streaming world. This transition has required management to make investments in its Disney+ streaming service that are depressing profitability today. However, we believe these investments will ultimately produce attractive returns as Disney+ continues to grow subscribers and increase pricing over time. As a result, we were able to purchase shares at a substantial discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Kid-Friendly Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested Articles:10 Stocks to Buy on Sale and Never Look Back12 Best Reddit Stocks To Invest In12 Best Financial Dividend Stocks to Invest InDisclosure.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the sector and its performance this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. The sizzling inflation and continuous interest rate hikes have taken nearly every sector into its fold this year. However, the consumer staples sector is performing better than the rest of the market because these companies exhibit strong demand for their products even during weak economic conditions. The growing demand gives the sector hedging capabilities against inflation, which makes investors pick these stocks over other risky industries. Some of the well-known names in the consumer staples sector include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP).Consumer staples companies benefitted a lot during the pandemic due to increased consumer spending, especially through digital channels. According to a report by JPMorgan, e-commerce represented 12% of gross sales in the first six months of 2020 and showed a 60% growth from the prior-year period (see the biggest e-commerce companies). The shift in the companies’ way of running businesses has further expanded the sector as people now have access to various online systems. This year’s returns have also shown that shares of the consumer staple companies have trounced their counterparts. The S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples index declined by 6.22% year-to-date, compared with a 29.6% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology index. Another report by Fidelity Investments shows that the consumer staples sector delivered a 14% annualized return in the last three years ending March 2022, compared with an 11% and 13.2% return for the energy and industrial sectors.Due to their non-cyclic nature, consumer staples have stable earnings, consistent cash flows, and strong balance sheets, which are very important from a dividend perspective. In the current market, investors prefer safe stocks that would help them to stay afloat and generate stable income. For this reason, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks in the sector.Story continues13 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks to Buy NowCopyright: jetcityimage / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are from the consumer staples sector and pay dividends to shareholders. We analyzed these stocks through their dividend policies, balance sheets, and overall fundamentals. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yields as of November 8.13. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Dividend Yield as of November 8: 0.73%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American multinational big-box store company. In October, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $525 with an Overweight rating on the shares, appreciating the company's unit growth and market share gains.In fiscal Q4 2022, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) reported revenue of $72 billion, which showed a 15% growth from the same period last year. The company ended the quarter with over $10.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Its total current assets amounted to over $32.6 billion, compared with $29.5 billion in the prior-year quarter.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 18 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks in the consumer staples sector.

Here is what the firm has to say:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”12.

Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”11.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)7.

The company's market valuation decreased by US$4.6b after the stock price dropped 4.3% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions.

The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Intuit (INTU) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.21 a share, just 20 days from its upcoming earnings release on November 29, 2022.Intuit's Earnings ESP sits at 3.15%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.21 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17.INTU is one of just a large database of Computer and Technology stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Nokia (NOK).Nokia, which is readying to report earnings on February 2, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.14 a share, and NOK is 85 days out from its next earnings report.Nokia's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 2.38% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.14.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, INTU and NOK could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

(NYSE:DVA) And They Just Picked Up 7.3% More Shares,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/john-nehra-independent-director-davita-122741167.html,1668083261,STORY,['DVA'],"[Potential DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) shareholders may wish to note that the Independent Director, John Nehra, recently bought US$356k worth of stock, paying US$71.14 for each share. Although the purchase only increased their holding by 7.3%, it is still a solid purchase in our view. View our latest analysis for DaVita The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At DaVitaOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Chief Operating Officer of Kidney Care Michael Staffieri for US$1.6m worth of shares, at about US$77.70 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$65.42. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 25.00k shares for US$1.9m. But they sold 3.02k shares for US$306k. Overall, DaVita insiders were net buyers during the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of DaVitaMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. DaVita insiders own about US$73m worth of shares. That equates to 1.2% of the company. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The DaVita Insider Transactions Indicate?The recent insider purchase is heartening. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest DaVita insiders are well aligned, and that they may think the share price is too low. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for DaVita you should be aware of, and 1 of them is significant.But note: DaVita may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

336,7b7e2b0c-363b-38d5-9536-a21f13424076,UNH,2022-11-10,Return Trends At UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) Aren't Appealing,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/return-trends-unitedhealth-group-nyse-120038809.html,1668081638,STORY,['UNH'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So, when we ran our eye over UnitedHealth Group's (NYSE:UNH) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on UnitedHealth Group is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.19 = US$27b ÷ (US$243b - US$101b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, UnitedHealth Group has an ROCE of 19%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Healthcare industry average of 10% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group roceIn the above chart we have measured UnitedHealth Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for UnitedHealth Group.So How Is UnitedHealth Group's ROCE Trending?While the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. The company has employed 72% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 19%. Since 19% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Another thing to note, UnitedHealth Group has a high ratio of current liabilities to total assets of 42%. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From UnitedHealth Group's ROCEThe main thing to remember is that UnitedHealth Group has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 177% return to those who've held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.If you want to continue researching UnitedHealth Group, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.While UnitedHealth Group may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Real estate stocks are one of the great investments of all time due to the high dividend yields compared to other stocks since these companies are required to give back 90% of their profits to the investors as dividends.The rapid rise of work-from-home trends around the world amid the COVID-19 pandemic affected the property sector. Despite this, a study by PWC reported that the industry continues to demonstrate its resilience by maintaining liquidity in capital markets. Real estate stocks were one of the top-performing sectors in S&amp;P 500 with a total return of +46.2% last year. This is projected to improve this 2022 as things are returning to normal.The leading subsector under REITs based on the Emerging Trends survey is the industrial/distribution subsector as it shows substantial investment and development prospects. Some of the stocks listed under this subsector are Americold Realty Trust (NYSE:COLD), STAG Industrial (NYSE:STAG), and Alpine Income Property Trust, Inc. (NYSE:PINE). Companies such as Essential Properties Realty Trust (NYSE:EPRT), Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (NYSE:MAA), and UMH Properties (NYSE:UMH) rank behind as demand for housing for single-family and multifamily is predicted to rise with rents and pricing returning to previous highs. Hotels, offices, and retail were severely hit during the outbreak but have since recovered.PGIM real estate reported that there are nine trends to look out for when considering investing in REITs. The nine trends are: Recovery turning to expansion, cities making a comeback, retail being back on the agenda, supply outlook remaining subdued, push for larger deals as investment volume grows, debt supply shifting toward a greater provision of non-bank capital, operational deals gaining further popularity, intensifying on the focus on green investments, and widening of the performance gap. Confidence in the business and profitability forecasts are high and are expected to grow further in the future years. Grand View Research predicts that the global market size of real estate will reach $5.85 trillion by 2030 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% starting this year.Story continuesRichest People Who Made Money Investing in Real EstatePhoto by Blake Wheeler on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe created a list of the top 10 real estate stocks to buy now.

The company's products are sold through department stores, mass retailers, company-owned retail stores, hair salons, and travel-related establishments.Analysts have been bearish regarding EL’s near-term earnings outlook, pushing it into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Let’s take a deeper dive into the company.Share PerformanceIt’s been a challenging road for EL shares in 2022, down more than 40% and widely underperforming the general market.And over the last three months, shares have continued on their downward trajectory, down more than 20% and again underperforming the general market.The adverse price action of EL shares tells us that sellers have remained in control, something we’ve seen with many stocks in a historically-volatile 2022.ValuationThe company’s forward earnings multiple sits at 38.4X, on the higher end of the spectrum and perhaps steering away value-focused investors.Further, the current value is above its five-year median of 34.1X and reflects a 92% premium relative to its Zacks sector average of 19.9X.The company carries a Value Style Score of an F.Quarterly Performance Still, the company carries a strong earnings track record, surpassing the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in nine consecutive quarters. Just in its latest print, EL registered a 6.2% bottom-line beat.Revenue results have also been strong, with EL penciling in seven top-line beats across its last ten quarters.Bottom LineNegative earnings estimate revisions and steep valuation multiples paint a less-than-ideal picture for the company in the short term.The Estee Lauder Companies is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), telling us it has a weak near-term earnings outlook.Investors should pivot to stocks that either carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks have a much stronger earnings outlook and potential to deliver explosive gains in the short term.Additional content:Can the PC Market Bounce Back from Its Recent Lows?Global PC sales, which surged at the height of the pandemic, have once again started declining. Sales of PCs, which include laptops and tablets, saw an unexpected jump during the peak of the pandemic as millions worked remotely. However, demand appears to be declining once again as things return to normal and people go back to their workplaces and schools.However, there are several other factors that are posing challenges for the PC market, the supply chain crisis being one of the biggest. It must overcome a number of obstacles, including a supply-chain problem. The industry thus needs to overcome these challenges to bounce back from the present situation.Global PC Shipment Hit New LowSeveral industries were left battered by the COVID-19 outbreak but some also managed to be big beneficiaries of the pandemic. One of them that benefited the most was the PC sector. However, things have once more shifted, and this year's sales are in free fall.According to a report from Gartner, global PC shipments totaled 68 million units in the third quarter of 2022, a 19.5% decline year over year. This is the sharpest drop in nine years and the second straight quarter of double-digit decline. PC shipments totaled 72 million in the second quarter, recording a decline of 12.6% year over year.PC sales started slowing last year once the economy started reopening. This year has particularly been worse given that sales have declined drastically in all the first three quarters of the year.The primary reason behind the decline in the third quarter was the lack of demand for PCs during the back-to-school season and shrinking enterprise purchasing.Challenges GaloreIndustry leaders have been suffering the most because of the decline in demand for PCs. The top three PC makers have likewise had the biggest loss throughout this time, despite the fact that their ranking has not changed.Lenovo Group Ltd., which is still the market leader, saw its market share increase in the third quarter of 2022 to 23.7%. However, on a year-over-year basis, LNGVY recorded a 16% decline in sales. This is also the fourth straight quarter of sales decline for Lenovo Group Limited.HP Inc. held its position as the second largest in terms of market share. HP now holds 18% of the market share but it managed to sell only 12.7 million units. This is also the second consecutive quarter when HP had less than 20% market share. Moreover, HP recorded a 26.5% year-over-year decline in sales in the third quarter.Dell Technologies Inc., the third largest player, saw its shipments plummet more than 20% in third-quarter 2022, after declining 5.2% in the previous quarter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The United States, one of the biggest markets, has seen a steep decline in PC sales in 2022. The U.S. PC market plummeted 17.3% in the third quarter, recording five straight quarters of declines. Slowing laptop sales is affecting the overall PC market in the United States, although demand for desktops showed modest improvement.The PC industry is facing several challenges. Inflation has been a major concern in the United States, which has seen people cutting down on expensive goods. The third quarter saw the supply-chain crisis finally easing but high inventory is now a fresh concern as demand continues to shrink in both the consumer and business markets.Lower demand for PC is also impacting semiconductor sales now. Several chipmakers have said that weaker demand for PCs is impacting its revenues.Overall, 2022 has been fairly challenging for the PC market and experts believe that the market will not improve before 2023. Given the ongoing challenges and weak demand, 2022 is likely to see a 13% year-over-year fall in global PC shipments, according to Gartner. The firm had earlier predicted a 9.5% year-over-year decline in salesWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Beauty Stocks To Buy Now. In times of economic downturns, the beauty industry remains resilient, as consumers still like to splurge on beauty and skincare regimen, even if it might be in moderation. In 2022, consistently high inflation has tampered with impulsive purchases of beauty and personal care products. In the 12 months to October 1, 2022, there was a 2.1% decline in the sale of face care products in the United States, although higher prices made up for the lower volume. Similarly in Europe, over one in five customers are forecasted to allocate less money to their make-up and skincare products in the near future, as per research from McKinsey. For huge beauty companies, having a diversified range of products at multiple price points has helped deal with the economic slowdown. In better economic times, premiumization in skincare and haircare has proven to be a consumer favorite, displaying superior growth. This is why firms like Unilever, whose prestige beauty segment posted double-digit growth in the third quarter of 2022, are experimenting with premium beauty products. Some of the best beauty stocks to consider in order to benefit from the defensive nature of the sector include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), and The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL). Our Methodology We selected the following beauty stocks based on growth fundamentals, positive analyst coverage, and strong market visibility.

Inspired by the growing demand for hygiene products, the Lifebuoy brand of soaps was launched to ‘make health infectious’. 128 years later the Lifebuoy brand continues as a leading soap brand – albeit without the coal tar-derived ingredients list. In fact, the market research firm Kantar ranked Lifebuoy as the global #3 most chosen FMCG brand in 2020, just below Coca-Cola (KO) and Colgate (CL) – an astonishing fact given the age of the brand. While the brand is largely absent from shelves here in the UK, it is a juggernaut in Asian markets, and is the #1 brand in India.There are two observations about the Lifebuoy story which tell us a lot about Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL), which is currently our largest holding in the Fund.The first is the enduring power of brands in the consumer goods market. According to Kantar’s list of most chosen brands, the top 20 global marques have an average age of 116 years, with over half being founded in the 19th century. Fashions come and go, but there is something special about low-cost consumable goods that advantages strong, time-worn brand names…” (Click here to view full text)9. e.l.f. Beauty, Inc.

Additionally, Coty is building momentum around a business transformation that’s in the early innings but has already seen success in e-commerce and direct-to-consumer gains, as well as a rising presence in China.”6. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is a general merchandise retailer in the United States that sells beauty products through its Target Beauty segment. On October 18, Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe upgraded Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $185, up from $170. Amid a ""challenging macroeconomic backdrop,"" a ""subdued"" valuation and advancements in supply chain and inventory support a bullish call on Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), the analyst told investors in a research note. The analyst believes the second half of 2022 risk exists but noted that 2023 will possibly bring  improved margins. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is better positioned than the broader retail sector currently, added the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 46 hedge funds were bullish on Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 50 funds in the last quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 2.6 million shares worth $369.4 million. Like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), and The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), elite hedge funds are backing Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) as a potential play in the beauty sector. Here is what LRT Capital Management specifically said about Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“The Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) operates retail stores that sell a variety of merchandise ranging from necessities such as food and hygiene products to discretionary products like children’s toys and electronics. The sale of this merchandise is done primarily through physical retail locations in all 50 US states. However, Target also sells its merchandise digitally through its online website which delivers merchandise to its customers in three ways: order pickup, drive up, and “Shipt”. The Target Corporation operates a single segment through 1,926 physical stores.Target is one of the largest US brick-and-mortar retailers and has successfully adapted to the competitive environment in the age of Amazon. As of 7/15/2022, TGT shares are down 36% for the year and down 44% since their all-time-high last year. The business is experiencing issues that are temporary in nature and we believe that the shares present an attractive opportunity at current prices. Target performed exceptionally well during the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath. Unfortunately, the company was recently caught flat footed, as consumer preferences shifted towards more spending on services (such as travel), at the expense of physical goods. As a result, the company found itself with an excess of inventory which will likely pressure margins in the next few quarters. Target is not alone in this predicament as many retailers such as Walmart and Best Buy have experienced similar issues over the last few months. The Covid-19 pandemic created enormous difficulties for retailers in forecasting demand and appropriate inventory levels. Clearing excess inventory will pressure margins in the short-term, and while this is a clear negative for the company, we do not believe it detracts from the long-term attractiveness of the business. Target shares are currently “on sale” due to increased uncertainty about near-term operating margins – this we believe is an opportunity.Weak consumer sentiment, a slowing economy, recession fears, along with a list of other problems have called Target’s margins and short-term profitability into question. Until the most recent earnings calls, Target and many other retailers were seeing record margins and consumer demand. This led to oversupplying of inventory with a now weaker consumer and that is temporarily damaging the operating metrics of Target and similar retailers. Target’s margins are among the highest in the retail industry, and although it will take a hit in the coming quarters the company’s operating margin will likely return to roughly 7% in the longer term…” (Click here to read the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Beauty Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:11 Best Bitcoin Stocks To BuyGoldman Sachs Dividend Stocks10 Undervalued European Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Best Beauty Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the sector and its performance this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. The sizzling inflation and continuous interest rate hikes have taken nearly every sector into its fold this year. However, the consumer staples sector is performing better than the rest of the market because these companies exhibit strong demand for their products even during weak economic conditions. The growing demand gives the sector hedging capabilities against inflation, which makes investors pick these stocks over other risky industries. Some of the well-known names in the consumer staples sector include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP).Consumer staples companies benefitted a lot during the pandemic due to increased consumer spending, especially through digital channels. According to a report by JPMorgan, e-commerce represented 12% of gross sales in the first six months of 2020 and showed a 60% growth from the prior-year period (see the biggest e-commerce companies). The shift in the companies’ way of running businesses has further expanded the sector as people now have access to various online systems. This year’s returns have also shown that shares of the consumer staple companies have trounced their counterparts. The S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples index declined by 6.22% year-to-date, compared with a 29.6% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology index. Another report by Fidelity Investments shows that the consumer staples sector delivered a 14% annualized return in the last three years ending March 2022, compared with an 11% and 13.2% return for the energy and industrial sectors.Due to their non-cyclic nature, consumer staples have stable earnings, consistent cash flows, and strong balance sheets, which are very important from a dividend perspective. In the current market, investors prefer safe stocks that would help them to stay afloat and generate stable income. For this reason, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks in the sector.Story continues13 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks to Buy NowCopyright: jetcityimage / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are from the consumer staples sector and pay dividends to shareholders. We analyzed these stocks through their dividend policies, balance sheets, and overall fundamentals. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yields as of November 8.13. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Dividend Yield as of November 8: 0.73%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American multinational big-box store company. In October, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $525 with an Overweight rating on the shares, appreciating the company's unit growth and market share gains.In fiscal Q4 2022, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) reported revenue of $72 billion, which showed a 15% growth from the same period last year. The company ended the quarter with over $10.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Its total current assets amounted to over $32.6 billion, compared with $29.5 billion in the prior-year quarter.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 18 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks in the consumer staples sector. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share for a dividend yield of 0.73%, as of November 8.At the end of Q2 2022, 64 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), up from 61 in the preceding quarter.

With stakes over $2 billion, Fisher Asset Management owned the largest position in the company in Q2.In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), investors are also paying attention to Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) due to its strong dividend policy.Cooper Investors mentioned Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”12. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Dividend Yield as of November 8: 1.56%Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail company that operates a chain of hypermarkets and grocery stores.

The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a total value of over $3.78 billion.Leaven Partners mentioned Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”11.

Here is what the firm has to say:“ADM is a leading agricultural processor that also operates a global nutrition business focused on the development of ingredients and flavors for food and beverages, supplements and more. The company’s recent operating results have benefited (unfortunately) from the war in Ukraine as grain prices and agricultural markets globally experienced strong price increases. ADM is positioned well to benefit from the volatility due to its stable North American agricultural base.”10.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)7.

With REIT prices down so much this year and dividend yields so high, now is a great time to pick up some high monthly income payers.But be careful and build this basket the right way. A good basket of REITs should have diversity among sectors, a decent dividend yield and funds from operations (FFO) that will cover the dividend payments to prevent dividend cuts. You can build a basket with a lump sum of money divided evenly among all five REITs or just buy an equal amount of shares of each.Here are five REITs that fit the above criteria and could provide safe and dependable monthly income, with a combined average dividend yield of 6.63%. A $25,000 basket will produce over $138 of income per month:Realty Income Corp. (NYSE: O) is a retail REIT with over 11,400 worldwide commercial properties on long-term net leases. Its tenants are large, well-known companies like Walgreens Co., Dollar Tree Inc. and FedEx Corp.Realty Income is one of the most popular, well-followed REITs. It’s one of only 65 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats because it has increased its dividends 117 times for at least 25 consecutive years. The annual FFO of $4.92 easily covers the annual $2.98 dividend, which now yields 4.71%.EPR Properties (NYSE: EPR) is a diversified experiential REIT that owns and operates 358 movie theater chains, amusement parks, resorts and other recreational venues.The 2020 pandemic forced EPR Properties to cut its quarterly dividend from $0.385 to $0.25, but it has since been raised to $0.275. The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by its movie theater tenant Cineworld Group plc in August pushed EPR Properties stock down from $54 to $35, but it’s up 11.5% since early October.Story continuesThe annual FFO of $4.67 easily covers the dividend of $3.20 for a yield of 8.19%. A bad recession or more theaters filing Chapter 11 could lead to a dividend cut or price decline, but EPR Properties has shown remarkable resiliency in the past, and it should find a way to overcome the current risks to continue providing secure income every month.LTC Properties Inc. (NYSE: LTC) is a healthcare REIT that owns and leases 202 senior housing and skilled nursing facilities in 29 states across the U.S. LTC Properties’ revenue is derived from triple-net leases, mortgages and mezzanine loans.The annual FFO of $2.54 covers the $2.28 annual dividend for a yield of 5.86%. While not a huge margin of safety, third-quarter FFO of $0.63 was $0.08 higher than the year-ago period, and management recently guided an increase in fourth-quarter FFO of $0.09 to $0.10 per share.SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) is an office REIT and the largest office landlord in New York City with 62 buildings totaling 33.6 million square feet.SL Green is not a well-loved stock on Wall Street because of fears that at-home workers will not return to office work. Short interest is also very high. But the price to FFO (P/FFO) of 5.67 seems to indicate that much of that fear is already baked into the stock price.The annual FFO of $6.70 provides huge shade over the annual dividend of $3.73 and yields a whopping 9.83%. At a recent price below $38, it seems to have more upside potential than downside risk.STAG Industrial Inc. (NYSE: STAG) is an industrial REIT that owns and operates 563 single-tenant industrial properties across 41 states. Amazon.com Inc. is STAG Industrial’s largest tenant and accounts for about 3% of its total rent.Stag Industrial’s third-quarter earnings were good and the Core FFO of $0.57 beat last year’s same-quarter results of $0.53 per diluted share.The annual FFO of $2.20 covers the $1.46 dividend and yields 4.59%.See more on real estate investing from BenzingaThis Multi-Family Financing Investment Has A 10.3% Target Annual YieldYieldstreet Provides Q3 Update On Its Non-Traded REITRead more...Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

350,70f969c5-2546-3c19-8d40-ed7cfca3ef9b,VNO,2022-11-10,Here's Why You Should Retain Vornado Realty (VNO) Stock Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-vornado-realty-135001219.html,1668001801,STORY,"['VNO', 'VNORP']","[Amid an improving office real estate market, a portfolio of high-quality assets in a few select high-rent, high-barrier-to-entry regional markets in the United States positions Vornado Realty Trust VNO well for growth.Along with a high market share in New York City office and Manhattan street retail, VNO has a controlling interest in 555 California Street and owns theMART in Chicago's River North District, which are iconic office assets in signature cities.Vornado is likely to benefit from a combination of office-using job growth, higher space utilization and expansion of technology, financial and media companies.Also, office occupiers are keen on growing their office footprint in New York City, where rents in the newly constructed or best-in-class redeveloped assets have risen. Vornado is well-placed to benefit from the emerging trend, given its ability to offer top-quality office spaces in this market.Vornado’s diversified tenant base, which includes several industry bellwethers, assures a stable cash flow generation for the company and fuels its long-term growth.To improve its core business, Vornado has been following a capital-recycling program. This gives it ample dry powder to reinvest in opportunistic developments and redevelopments and enhance overall portfolio quality. In August 2022, Vornado entered into an agreement to sell 40 Fulton Street for $102 million. The sale of this 251,000 square feet Manhattan office and retail building is likely to be completed in fourth-quarter 2022.Vornado enjoys solid balance-sheet strength. It exited the third quarter of 2022 with $3.3 billion of liquidity. Additionally, VNO’s current cash flow growth is projected at 48.78% compared with the 9.70% growth expected for the industry.Although shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 21.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 18.2%, analysts seem bullish on the stock.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vornado’s 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share has been revised marginally upward over the past week to $3.07.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, a rise in the supply of office properties is a key concern for Vornado. Also, intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties and other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from its tenants, limits VNO’s ability to increase rents and/or backfill tenant move-outs and vacancies.Vornado has a major market share, both office and retail, in New York City. This makes it susceptible to the economic conditions prevailing in that region, which could hurt the company’s cashflows and impede growth.A hike in interest rates is likely to increase borrowing costs, affecting the company’s ability to purchase or develop real estate.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties VICI, Equity Commonwealth EQC and Gladstone Commercial GOOD, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for VICI Properties’ current-year FFO per share is currently pegged at $1.91.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Equity Commonwealth’s ongoing year’s FFO per share has presently stands at 16 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Gladstone Commercial’s 2022 FFO per share is pegged at $1.57, presently.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The upside was mainly due to higher unit sales owing to good demand from industrial capital goods and commodities, which offset softer markets tied to consumer goods and relatively lower growth in construction.United Rentals, Inc. URI reported third-quarter 2022 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same. The company has been gaining from the sustained demand in its end markets and the strength of its core rental business.URI also lifted its full-year guidance for total revenues and adjusted EBITDA, given broad-based end-market activity, contractor backlogs, customer sentiment and solid visibility.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Sponsored ADR (LOMA) and D.R. Horton (DHI). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Loma Negra Compania Industrial Argentina S.A. Sponsored ADR has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while D.R. Horton has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that LOMA likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than DHI has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.LOMA currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.46, while DHI has a forward P/E of 5.94. We also note that LOMA has a PEG ratio of 0.17. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. DHI currently has a PEG ratio of 0.66.Another notable valuation metric for LOMA is its P/B ratio of 0.94. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, DHI has a P/B of 1.38.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, LOMA holds a Value grade of A, while DHI has a Value grade of D.LOMA sticks out from DHI in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that LOMA is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We believe we have an obligation to our customers, team members, shareholders and the communities we serve to transition to operating a low-carbon airline. To make that happen, we have set aggressive climate goals that match the seriousness of the challenge, and we've laid out a clear plan for how we will achieve them.Our aim is to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, and we have set an intermediate target to drive progress toward that goal. In April 2022, we received validation from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) that our intermediate 2035 GHG reduction target complies with the SBTi criteria. That makes us the first airline globally to achieve this milestone.American's science-based target is to reduce carbon intensity, which means GHG emissions per unit of passenger and cargo payload that the airline transports, by 45% by 2035, compared to a 2019 baseline. In setting this goal, we are committing to reduce the intensity associated with the entire life cycle emissions of jet fuel. This includes both direct emissions (Scope 1) - which are primarily from the jet fuel used in flight - and the emissions from the production of the jet fuel the airline uses (Scope 3).In 2022, American became the first airline globally to receive validation from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) that our 2035 GHG reduction target complies with the SBTi criteria.American has also committed to reduce by 40% the emissions from the production of the electricity we purchase (Scope 2) by 2035, also with a 2019 baseline. Scope 2 emissions are a small part of our overall GHG emissions, but an important focus for reducing the impacts of global warming.We are also engaging with and supporting efforts to drive broader action on climate across the public and private sectors. For example, American is a signatory to the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign, and we joined the United Nations-backed Race to Zero. We are also an anchor partner, together with other leading companies, of Breakthrough Energy Catalyst (see page 13). We know that our ability to achieve our climate goals depends on other actors - within the aviation industry and beyond it - and we intend to be a leader in helping drive the operational, policy and technological changes needed to advance the transition to a low-carbon economy.Story continuesOUR CLIMATE GOALSACHIEVEDReceived SBTi validation for our 2035 GHG emissions reduction goalIN PROGRESSAchieve absolute reduction of 50m gallons of jet fuel from fuelefficiency initiatives by 2025Source 2.5m GJs of cost-competitive renewable energy by 2025Replace 10% of our jet fuel with SAF by 2030Reduce GHG emissions intensity by 45% by 2035Reduce Scope 2 emissions by 40% by 2035Achieve net zero emissions by 2050Read moreView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from American Airlines on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: American AirlinesWebsite: profiles/american-airlinesEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: American AirlinesView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/724850/American-Airlines-Aims-to-Achieve-Net-Zero-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-by-2050]"

363,27916d6d-ee9f-3e6c-be50-e1a595be30bb,AFL,2022-11-10,Aflac (NYSE:AFL) Is Increasing Its Dividend To $0.40,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aflac-nyse-afl-increasing-dividend-133439344.html,1668000879,STORY,['AFL'],"[Aflac Incorporated (NYSE:AFL) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 1st of December to $0.40. The payment will take the dividend yield to 2.4%, which is in line with the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Aflac Aflac's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. However, Aflac's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 25.6% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 29%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future.historic-dividendAflac Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.66 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.60. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 9.3% per annum over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that Aflac has grown earnings per share at 19% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.Aflac Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Aflac is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think American Water Works Company (NYSE:AWK) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on American Water Works Company is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.052 = US$1.3b ÷ (US$27b - US$2.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, American Water Works Company has an ROCE of 5.2%. On its own that's a low return, but compared to the average of 4.3% generated by the Water Utilities industry, it's much better. View our latest analysis for American Water Works Company roceIn the above chart we have measured American Water Works Company's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering American Water Works Company here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For American Water Works Company Tell Us?In terms of American Water Works Company's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 7.1% over the last five years. However it looks like American Water Works Company might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayTo conclude, we've found that American Water Works Company is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Since the stock has gained an impressive 68% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.American Water Works Company does come with some risks though, we found 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is a bit concerning...While American Water Works Company isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our detailed analysis of the sector and its performance this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. The sizzling inflation and continuous interest rate hikes have taken nearly every sector into its fold this year. However, the consumer staples sector is performing better than the rest of the market because these companies exhibit strong demand for their products even during weak economic conditions. The growing demand gives the sector hedging capabilities against inflation, which makes investors pick these stocks over other risky industries. Some of the well-known names in the consumer staples sector include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP).Consumer staples companies benefitted a lot during the pandemic due to increased consumer spending, especially through digital channels. According to a report by JPMorgan, e-commerce represented 12% of gross sales in the first six months of 2020 and showed a 60% growth from the prior-year period (see the biggest e-commerce companies). The shift in the companies’ way of running businesses has further expanded the sector as people now have access to various online systems. This year’s returns have also shown that shares of the consumer staple companies have trounced their counterparts. The S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples index declined by 6.22% year-to-date, compared with a 29.6% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology index. Another report by Fidelity Investments shows that the consumer staples sector delivered a 14% annualized return in the last three years ending March 2022, compared with an 11% and 13.2% return for the energy and industrial sectors.Due to their non-cyclic nature, consumer staples have stable earnings, consistent cash flows, and strong balance sheets, which are very important from a dividend perspective. In the current market, investors prefer safe stocks that would help them to stay afloat and generate stable income. For this reason, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks in the sector.Story continues13 Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks to Buy NowCopyright: jetcityimage / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below are from the consumer staples sector and pay dividends to shareholders. We analyzed these stocks through their dividend policies, balance sheets, and overall fundamentals. The stocks are ranked according to their dividend yields as of November 8.13. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Dividend Yield as of November 8: 0.73%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American multinational big-box store company. In October, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $525 with an Overweight rating on the shares, appreciating the company's unit growth and market share gains.In fiscal Q4 2022, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) reported revenue of $72 billion, which showed a 15% growth from the same period last year. The company ended the quarter with over $10.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Its total current assets amounted to over $32.6 billion, compared with $29.5 billion in the prior-year quarter.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 18 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks in the consumer staples sector. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share for a dividend yield of 0.73%, as of November 8.At the end of Q2 2022, 64 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), up from 61 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $4.76 billion. With stakes over $2 billion, Fisher Asset Management owned the largest position in the company in Q2.In addition to The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), investors are also paying attention to Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) due to its strong dividend policy.Cooper Investors mentioned Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The US economy continues to run hot – the labour market is extremely tight and a number of executives we spoke to described their challenges in retaining staff and preventing competitors from poaching talent. Industrial companies in particular continue to see record backlogs, with the easing of logistics and supply chain constraints only just starting to have an impact on deliveries and lead times.In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”12. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Dividend Yield as of November 8: 1.56%Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail company that operates a chain of hypermarkets and grocery stores. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company maintains a 49-year track record of consistent dividend growth. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.56 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.56%, as of November 8.Jefferies lifted its price target on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in October to $165 with a Buy rating on the shares, calling the company a value leader in retail. The firm mentioned that the company is well-positioned to benefit in the current environment.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was a popular buy among elite funds in Q2 2022, as 67 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned positions in it, up from 60 a quarter earlier. The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a total value of over $3.78 billion.Leaven Partners mentioned Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”11. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM)Dividend Yield as of November 8: 1.66%Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is an Illinois-based multinational food processing and commodities trading company. Baird lifted its price target on the stock to $98 in October with an Outperform rating on the shares.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)7.

It beat estimates for both earnings and sales, driven by growth in Eylea and Dupixent and progress on launches in pediatric atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis.  Third-quarter earnings of $11.14 per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.65. The year-ago quarter recorded earnings per share of $15.37 due to higher sales. Total revenues in the reported quarter were down 15% year over year to $2.9 billion but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.8 billion. Excluding REGEN-COV (a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies — casirivimab and imdevimab) for COVID-19, sales increased 11%.Regeneron also obtained FDA approval for the label expansion of PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc) for another indication.  The drug has been approved in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 aberrations.  The drug has been approved for patients who either have metastatic or locally advanced tumors that are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation. Patients may be treated with this combination irrespective of PD-L1 expression or histology.

Lower operating expenses and share count boosted earnings in the quarter. Total revenues of $6.65 billion also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.57 billion. However, revenues declined 1% year over year due to lower product sales as higher volumes were offset by lower selling prices of several drugs and currency headwinds. The company now expects revenues in the range of $26.0 billion to $26.3 billion versus the prior expectation of $25.5 billion to $26.4 billion. Earnings are expected in the range of $17.25 to $17.85 (earlier projection: $17.00 to $18.00).Story continuesModerna MRNA reported earnings of $2.53 per share in the third quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04 and down from $7.70 in the year-ago quarter.  The year-over-year decline in the bottom line was due to lower revenues and higher operating expenses incurred during the third quarter. Revenues in the quarter were $3.36 billion, which also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.33 billion. Total revenues were down 32.3% year over year due to declining COVID-19 vaccine sales during the quarter.Following the delay of certain deliveries of its bivalent COVID-19 vaccine doses due to short-term supply-related issues, Moderna cut its annual sales forecast for its COVID-19 vaccine. Management now expects revenue from advanced purchase agreements in the range of $18-$19 billion, down from the previous guidance of nearly $21 billion.

379,3e03715e-ea3a-3a4f-bf2f-36baa9699eef,CSCO,2022-11-10,Cisco Systems (CSCO) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-csco-earnings-expected-150003347.html,1668006003,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (CSCO) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 16, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis seller of routers, switches, software and services is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.84 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.4%.Revenues are expected to be $13.32 billion, up 3.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cisco?For Cisco, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.46%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Cisco will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cisco would post earnings of $0.82 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.83, delivering a surprise of +1.22%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cisco appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
