1,4d94b7e7-d292-31c9-bc63-bf31e41c7272,WDC,2023-02-05,7 Sorry Semiconductor Stocks to Sell in February Before It’s Too Late,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-sorry-semiconductor-stocks-sell-000716121.html,1675296436,STORY,"['NVDA', 'WDC', 'NXPI', 'QCOM', 'AMAT', 'INTC', 'MRVL', 'MU', 'AMD']","[Semiconductor stocks were among the most battered names in 2022. A supply glut coupled with slowing sales of personal computers, smartphones and other devices conspired to drag the stocks of nearly all semiconductor and microchip companies lower. Even leading semiconductor companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) were not spared from the carnage. The PHLX Semiconductor Sector index (NASDAQ:SOX), which is comprised of 30 top semiconductor companies, is down 19% from a year ago. And that’s after posting a 15% gain in January of this year. While the semiconductor industry is starting to show signs of a recovery, there is still a long way to go to get back to the levels seen during the height of the global pandemic. And the recovery so far has not been even. Here are seven sorry semiconductor stocks to sell in February before it’s too late.INTCIntel$30WDCWestern Digital$44MUMicron$62.60MRVLMarvell$48.20QCOMQualcomm$135NXPINXP Semiconductors$194AMATApplied Materials$123Semiconductor Stocks to Sell: Intel (INTC)The Intel logo in blue on a black screen.Source: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.comWe’ll start with the worst semiconductor company right now, and that would be Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The Santa Clara, California-based company has been in the news a lot lately following horrendous earnings that caused the stock to dive 10% and led to job cuts and executive pay being slashed.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIntel reported that it earned 10 cents for the fourth and final quarter of 2022, which was half the 20 cents expected, on average, by analysts on Wall Street. Intel’s Q4 revenue fell 32% year-over-year to $14.04 billion compared to the mean estimate of $14.45 billion that was anticipated,. The company recorded a  Q4 net loss of $664 million, compared with a profit of $4.62 billion  during the same quarter a year earlier. The firm’s forward guidance was equally bad.Intel blamed the ugly results on declining sales of personal computers and conceded that it is losing market share to rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). In the days since the results, Intel has responded with more job cuts and plans to cut executive pay, including a 25% cut to the salary of CEO Pat Gelsinger.Story continuesBut investors don’t appear to be having any of it. INTC stock is now down 42% from a year ago and trading at $28 a share.Western Digital (WDC)Front of a Western Digital (WDC) building in Malpitas, California.Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comWestern Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), which makes memory chips along with data storage devices, is another company whose stock is getting hammered following its latest earnings print. Western Digital reported a loss of 42 cents a share on revenue of $3.11 billion. Analysts who cover the company were calling for, on average, a loss of 15 cents on revenue of $2.99 billion, according to Refinitiv. WDC stock fell 6% immediately after the results were made public.The San Jose, California-based company said that the market for its memory chips is going through one of its worst downturns ever. The earnings miss comes as rumors intensify that Western Digital is considering a potential merger with Japan’s Kioxia Holdings. A combination of Western Digital and privately held Kioxia  would control a third of the market for flash memory and enable the new entity to compete against global leader Samsung Electronics.Rumors of the Kioxia merger come as Western Digital tries to appease activist investor Elliott Management, which targeted the company last year. Over the past 12 months, WDC stock has declined nearly 20% to $42 a share.Micron Technology (MU)Micron (MU) logo on a mobile phone that's on a tableSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comBoise, Idaho-based Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a legacy tech company that has been a going concern since 1978. Its best days were during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s. In many ways, the company and its long suffering shareholders have never recovered from the dotcom bubble bursting in the early 2000s. Today, MU stock trades at $60 a share, down 25% in the last 12 months alone. The stock’s all-time peak came in early 2000 when it was trading at just over $100.As with Western Digital, Micron is screaming that the bottom has fallen out of the memory chip market, causing a disaster for its finances. Micron’s revenue plunged 47% year-over-year in its fiscal first quarter ended December 1, 2022. Guidance for the current quarter was a horror show, with Micron saying it expects to produce $3.8 billion in revenue in the fiscal second quarter, down 51% year-over-year, and report a net loss of 62 cents a share.Like a lot of semiconductor companies that have lost market share, Micron is trying to spend its way out of trouble. Specifically, the company has announced plans to allocate $15 billion to build a new memory chip plant in Boise that it says will create 17,000 jobs. While encouraging, the memory chip plant isn’t scheduled to be completed until the end of this decade, at the earliest. Meanwhile, the company continues to talk publicly about the need for more government subsidies to help it compete in a global market.Marvell Technology (MRVL)image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campusSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comThe shares of Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) have struggled mightily over the last year. Since February 2022, MRVL stock has declined nearly 40% to $45 a share. The company, which makes semiconductors for data storage, communications and consumer markets, has been hurt coming out of the pandemic by supply chain constraints and weakening demand for its products. Marvell Technology most recently announced a new CFO, Willem Meintjes, as it tries to get its fiscal house in order.In terms of earnings, Marvell most recently reported earnings per share of 2 cents. While that was up from a net loss a year earlier, it still missed analysts’ average  expectations by more than 2%. The company is hoping to turn things around this year as inflation and interest rates moderate and the supply chain problems that vexed it over the last year resolve themselves.While some analysts remain bullish on the stock, investors should wait for the company to embark on  a real, substantial turnaround before investing in MRVL stock.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on a large sign with another sign that says 5GSource: Xixi Fu / Shutterstock.comSan Diego-based Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) makes semiconductors that enable  smartphones and other devices to exploit 5G. While that sounds like a good business to be om right now, Qualcomm’s business and stock are suffering. Growing fears of an economic recession have led many businesses and consumers to hit pause on upgrading to 5G wireless. At the same time, Qualcomm faces intense competition from the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:APPL) and Samsung.As a result, QCOM stock is down 26% over the past year. Qualcomm has quarterly earnings on deck, but many analysts are forecasting a rough road ahead for the company following lackluster results from other semiconductor companies such as Micron and Marvell.Qualcomm is also being hurt by a decline of smartphone sales, which fell nearly 10% in 2022, according to market research firm IDC. At the midpoint of its guidance range, the company is calling for its revenue to fall 10% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier.NXP Semiconductor (NXPI)A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor. NXPI stock.Source: Lukassek / Shutterstock.comDutch company NXP Semiconductor (NASDAQ:NXPI) makes microchips and semiconductors for the automotive, industrial and internet of things (IoT) markets. There was some buzz around NXP Semiconductor a few years ago when the aforementioned Qualcomm tried to buy the company. However, Chinese authorities squashed the proposed acquisition and NXP Semiconductor has been largely drifting ever since. In the past year, NXPI stock has dropped 8%. There are currently rumors that Samsung is considering buying NXP Semiconductor, though no deal has been announced.More recently, NXP Semiconductor has gotten caught up in President Biden’s efforts to limit semiconductor sales and chipmaker activities in China due to security concerns. President Biden has rallied international support for limiting the flow of advanced technologies to China, including from the government of the Netherlands where NXP is based.The move to curtail technology flows and activities in China is bad news for NXP Semiconductor, which until now had a strong presence in the world’s second-largest economy.Semiconductor Stocks to Sell: Applied Materials (AMAT)Applied Materials company sign outside officeSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.comSanta Clara-California-based Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a little different than the other companies on this list because it supplies the equipment and software needed to manufacture semiconductors. And its business is only as strong as the semiconductor and microchip market. As that market has slumped over the past year, AMAT stock has declined 15%. The company has been around since 1967 and survived many previous market cycles.Applied Materials is still waiting for the supply chain snarls that impacted the semiconductor space to ease this year and for orders from leading customers such as Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) to pick up.At the same time, Applied Materials is being hurt by President Biden’s efforts to curtail technology shipments and activity in China. Applied Materials said that China accounted for 28% of its 2022 revenue, and that the new U.S. rules could cost it $2.5 billion in lost revenue this year.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and AAPL.

3,c9714da8-8e48-31fe-91eb-1851d3e72d88,TMO,2023-02-05,We Think Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) Can Stay On Top Of Its Debt,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-thermo-fisher-scientific-nyse-110059975.html,1675594859,STORY,['TMO'],"[Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt Dangerous?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific How Much Debt Does Thermo Fisher Scientific Carry?As you can see below, Thermo Fisher Scientific had US$34.5b of debt, at December 2022, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$8.52b, its net debt is less, at about US$26.0b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Thermo Fisher Scientific's LiabilitiesWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Thermo Fisher Scientific had liabilities of US$17.1b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$36.0b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$8.52b as well as receivables valued at US$8.27b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$36.3b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Given Thermo Fisher Scientific has a humongous market capitalization of US$231.6b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).We'd say that Thermo Fisher Scientific's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 2.2), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its strong interest cover of 18.9 times, makes us even more comfortable. Unfortunately, Thermo Fisher Scientific's EBIT flopped 16% over the last four quarters. If that sort of decline is not arrested, then the managing its debt will be harder than selling broccoli flavoured ice-cream for a premium. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Thermo Fisher Scientific's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last three years, Thermo Fisher Scientific produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 77% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewBoth Thermo Fisher Scientific's ability to to cover its interest expense with its EBIT and its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow gave us comfort that it can handle its debt. In contrast, our confidence was undermined by its apparent struggle to grow its EBIT. Considering this range of data points, we think Thermo Fisher Scientific is in a good position to manage its debt levels. Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Thermo Fisher Scientific   you should know about.Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

7,7811164b-cdd9-3c90-b689-89c6d2060062,O,2023-02-05,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-050432015.html,1675573472,STORY,"['HO=F', 'CL=F', 'GC=F', '^TNX']","[By Barani KrishnanInvesting.com -- Unemployment and inflation, in theory, are at odds with each other. Taken simply, when more people are unemployed, price pressures are less. But on a deeper level, the so-called inverse relationship is more complicated. And it can break down. For instance, the blowout U.S. jobs numbers for January released Friday, on the back of what the Fed calls disinflation. And this week’s oil market crash on that.Historically, there has been a strong positive correlation between jobs and crude prices. And that’s quite logical. When a greater number of people have jobs and are commuting to them (notwithstanding the post-pandemic work-from-home culture), the more transportation fuels, gasoline included, would be needed to move them around.So, not surprisingly, upon release of the January nonfarm payrolls, or NFP, report from the Labor Department, crude prices rose more than 2.5% as oil bulls tried to exploit the typical connection between such data and energy demand.But the dollar’s rapid surge on the same jobs report put paid to crude’s advance.Oil eventually capsized in a sea of red with gold and other commodities as the dollar’s rebound from 10-month lows made raw materials priced in the U.S. currency costlier for non-dollar holders.Crude prices settled the week down 7%, taking global benchmark Brent to below $80 per barrel while bringing WTI, or the U.S. West Texas Intermediate, to the low $70s.It proved one thing: Good U.S. jobs numbers are no longer an assurance for higher oil prices - not when you have a rebounding dollar and rate uncertainty to contend with.According to the NFP report, some 517,000 jobs were added last month - almost three times above the forecast growth of 185,000 and against December’s number of 260,000. The outperformance threw a fresh challenge to the Federal Reserve, which had been hoping its aggressive rate hikes over the past year would have sufficiently cooled the labor market and wages to get inflation back to its target.Story continuesThe Dollar Index and yields on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, which act as contra trades against risk assets that include stocks and commodities, surged on the NFP report. They could continue rising if the Fed rethinks its plan about further consolidating rate hikes this year. The central bank went from a 50-basis point rate hike in December to 25-basis points in February.As though sensing a tougher challenge for this year, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told a news conference on Wednesday that while the pace of job gains had slowed late last year, “the labor market continues to be out of balance”.The Fed has increased rates by 450 basis points in a monetary tightening cycle that began in March 2022, two years after the coronavirus outbreak, which led to trillions of dollars in relief spending that pumped up the economy and triggered runaway inflation.Inflation, as measured by the CPI, or Consumer Price Index, hit four-decade highs in June when it expanded at 9.1% yearly. In December, the CPI grew at 6.5% per annum, its slowest since October 2021. But it was still more than three times the Fed’s target of 2% per annum.Yet, Powell saw it fit to say that “for the first time, the disinflationary process has started.”“We can see it,” he said. “We see it really in goods prices so far.”Fed maneuvers aside, oil prices were on the back foot after a sixth straight weekly build in U.S. crude, along with surpluses in fuels, reported by the EIA, or Energy Information Administration, this week.U.S. crude inventories rose by 4.14M barrels during the week ended Jan. 27, the EIA said in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report. The build was above the 0.376M forecast by industry analysts and compared with the rise of 0.533M reported by the EIA during the previous week to Jan 20.For context, the EIA has reported a total crude build of 34.5M barrels over the past six weeks. At current standing, crude stockpiles are at the highest since June 2021, said the EIA, the statistical arm of the U.S. Energy Department.On the gasoline inventory front, the EIA cited a build of 2.576M barrels, versus the forecast of 1.442M and the previous week’s rise of 1.763M.Gasoline inventories have gone up by almost 13 million barrels since 2023 began. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.Distillates stockpiles also rose, for the first time in five weeks. Here, there was a build of 2.32M barrels versus the expected deficit of 1.3M. In the previous week, distillate draws stood at 507,000 barrels.Until last week, distillates - which are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains, and ships, and fuel for jets - were the strongest component of U.S. petroleum demand. Prior to the build in the latest week, distillate stockpiles had fallen by around 5 million barrels over four weeks.""Commercial storage in North America is ample,"" Norbert Ruecker, economist at the bank Julius Baer, said in comments carried by Reuters. ""The improved market mood has lifted prices of late, but this support should remain temporary. We see lower prices longer term, in line with the futures market’s expectations.""Also weighing on the market was OPEC+’s decision this week to leave production levels unchanged and uncertainties over how well demand from China would fare in February - more than a month after the top crude importer abandoned all COVID restrictions.On China’s side, crude imports were assessed at 10.98M bpd, or barrels per day, in January, down from December's 11.37M bpd and November's 11.42M bpd, a Reuters report said Thursday. Part of the decline in Chinese imports was likely due to the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell on January 22 this year, the report added.ANZ analysts concurred with that, noting a sharp jump in traffic in China’s 15 largest cities following the Lunar New Year holiday but acknowledging that Chinese oil traders had been “relatively absent” from the market.Despite this, Asia’s total crude oil imports jumped by 11.1% month over month to 29.13 million bpd in January. The imports last month beat the previous record from November, when Asia imported 29.10 million bpd of crude oil. This is the sort of data that those long the market are counting on for a rebound of the market in the coming weeks.The European Union's new sanctions on Russian fuel products, which came into force on Sunday, could hit Moscow's energy revenue, but are unlikely to weigh on its overall production, said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler.A coalition of Group of Seven economies, the EU and Australia set caps at $100 per barrel on products that trade at a premium to crude, principally diesel, and $45 per barrel for products that trade at a discount, such as fuel oil and naphtha. The same group on Dec. 5 set a $60 cap on Russian crude oil.Like the crude price cap, the ones on Russian fuels will further weigh on the flat price of diesel and other products, even if the limits are way above selling prices, said Smith.That will fulfill another agenda of the G7 and its allies, that is seldom discussed in the media. And that is to make sure Russia’s oil and energy products reach the markets, but not at the prices the Kremlin wants.The Biden administration, particularly, is hoping the caps will force Vladimir Putin to put out even more barrels to fund his war against Ukraine. That will indirectly suppress global energy prices further - a gift to fighting inflation.Oil: Market Settlements and ActivityNew York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March had a final trade of $73.23 on Friday, after settling at $73.39 a barrel, down $2.49, or 3.2% on the day. For the week, WTI dropped by just over 7.5%. Month-to-date, the U.S. crude benchmark was also down about 7%, extending its near 9% slide over three previous months.London-traded Brent crude for March delivery registered a final trade of $79.82, after settling at $79.94, down $2.23, or 2.7%. Brent earlier hit a three-week low at $79.89. For the week, the global crude benchmark was down about 7.5%, after last week’s near 3% loss. For February thus far, Brent has lost 5.4%, extending its 6.5% slide since the end of December.Oil: Price OutlookWTI’s technicals point to a chance of a further drop below $70 per barrel in the coming week, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“Despite a previously strong upward move, WTI failed to hold temporary gains and fell from a $80.50 weekly high and closed at $73.20, well below the $76.40 and $75.50 support,” Dixit said.Any recovery towards $75.40 and $76.40 will attract sellers, resuming a decline towards the 50-month Exponential Moving Average of $71.80 and the December low of $70.10, Dixit said.The U.S. crude benchmark’s long-term support of the 200-week Simple Moving Average of $65.78 remains untested, he added.Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity Natural gas futures tumbled 21% for the week as the heating fuel continued its descent into a seemingly bottomless abyss despite the arrival of freezing weather in the key Northeastern U.S. region, which until this week had experienced an unusually warm winter.The front-month March gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub settled down 4.6 cents, or 1.8%, at $2.385 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units. The session bottom was $2.343, which marked a low not seen since Dec. 29, 2020, when it fell to $2.282.For the week, the benchmark gas futures contract lost 21%, extending to almost 65% its tumble from December’s $7 high. Prior to that, it traded at a 14-year peak of $10 in August.An unusually warm start to the 2022/23 winter has led to considerably less heating demand in the United States versus the norm, leaving more gas in storage than initially thought.At the close of last week, U.S. gas storage stood at 2.583 tcf, or trillion cubic feet, up 9.4% from the year-ago level of 2.361 tcf, data from the Energy Information Administration showed.Since the start of this week though, the weather has been colder, reaching 20 Fahrenheit (-6.7 Celsius) on Friday in New York City and some other key locations in the U.S. Northeast, which accounts for the largest heating market in the United States.Natural gas: Price Outlook“Gas has gone to extreme oversold conditions and its weekly Relative Strength Index is now at 28, matching the pattern of the 8 bearish weeks during its decline from a $10 peak to $4.75,” said Dixit of SKCharting.He said a short-term rebound from this week’s $2.35 low was a possibility, but this needs clear acceptance above $2.87 for an upside potential towards $3.30.“Sustainability below $2.87 will keep prices under pressure and trying to dig deeper.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold tumbled almost 3% on Friday after a blockbuster U.S. jobs report for January triggered profit-taking on the precious metal’s long-running rally, putting it way off the $2,000-an-ounce target eyed by bulls in the space.Gold for April delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,877.70 on Friday, after settling at $1,868.30 an ounce, down $53.90, or 2.8%. It hit a four-week low of $1,874.55 during the session.It was the first time since Jan. 12 that gold’s $1,900 support on Comex had crumbled.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, was at $1,864.93, down $47.64, or 2.49%.Gold’s plunge came as the Dollar Index and yields on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note surged after the U.S. Labor Department reported a non-farm payrolls growth for January that was almost three times above forecast, throwing a fresh challenge to the Federal Reserve’s hopes of seeing a cooling of the labor market and wages to get inflation to its target.Gold: Price Outlook Dixit noted that it took gold just two days to undo its 30-day climb from $1,860 to $1,960.“Going in to the week ahead, gold needs to hold defense at the 50-Day EMA of $1,854, failing which the metal runs the risk of a correction extending toward $1,842 and $1,828,” he said.Any recovery, meanwhile, faces challenges at $1,878-$1,885, followed by $1,900-$1,914. before retesting major resistance and supply zone at $1,929, Dixit said.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesOil falls about 3% as strong U.S. jobs data prompt interest rate concernsNatural gas hits more than 2-year low, sinks 21% for week]"

The FAA said FedEx Express Flight 1432, a Boeing 767 cargo plane, which had departed from Memphis, was cleared to land on Runway 18-Left around 6:40 a.m. while the aircraft was several miles from the airport. The Southwest plane had not yet departed when the FedEx plane was nearing the runway.""The pilot of the FedEx airplane discontinued the landing and initiated a climb out,"" the FAA said.It was not clear precisely how close the two airplanes came to colliding, but flight tracking website data suggested they came very close.The Cancun, Mexico-bound Southwest flight, a Boeing 737-700, safely departed and landed at 9:47 a.m. ET.Southwest declined to comment.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Schlumberger's shares before the 7th of February in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 6th of April.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.25 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.00 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Schlumberger has a trailing yield of 1.9% on the current stock price of $52.64. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Schlumberger's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Schlumberger paying out a modest 27% of its earnings. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Dividends consumed 60% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.It's positive to see that Schlumberger's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Fortunately for readers, Schlumberger's earnings per share have been growing at 15% a year for the past five years. Schlumberger is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. This is a reasonable combination that could hint at some further dividend increases in the future.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Schlumberger has seen its dividend decline 0.9% per annum on average over the past 10 years, which is not great to see.Final TakeawayIs Schlumberger worth buying for its dividend? From a dividend perspective, we're encouraged to see that earnings per share have been growing, the company is paying out less than half of its earnings, and a bit over half its free cash flow. There's a lot to like about Schlumberger, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.While it's tempting to invest in Schlumberger for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. For example - Schlumberger has 3 warning signs we think you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

A multitude of corporations are targeting the football field, aiming to reap substantial rewards from their high-profile, multi-million dollar advertisements featuring famous stars.A typical 00:30 second spot runs about $7 million this year. That's up from $2.5 million in 2010, according to Timothy Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management who tracks the numbers each year. He says the cost only goes up from there.""If you're going to do the 00:60 second spot, let's call that $14 [million], let's put $2 million in production...$2 million on social media... and $2 million on other promotions,"" he said, with a grand total ""easily at $20 [million].""Companies aren't waiting for kick-off for their ROI. Calkins said that advertisers ""should already have recouped [their] investment before the game actually starts"" by building up excitement.""It's not just releasing a teaser spot.

In the co-branded campaign, Ferrell drives GM EVs through various Netflix shows, including ""Stranger Things,"" ""Love is Blind,"" and a ""Squid Game.""Meanwhile, Michelob ULTRA showcased a beer tap emerging out of a golf bag with a TV on it. On the screen is Netflix's new ""Full Swing"" the documentary, showing a brief clip of the show that is set to debut on February 15.Story continuesAllen Adamson, co-founder of the marketing and brand consultant company Metaforce, said both companies were likely trying to differentiate themselves from other companies.""By trying to be closer to the Netflix's hipness and current buzz among consumers, whatever programming it is...advertisers are hoping to break out of the sea of sameness where everyone is doing the same.""Another partnership this year is Molson Coors (TAP) joining forces with sports betting platform Draft Kings (DKNG). Consumers are encouraged to bet on details of the spot ahead of the game for the chance to win a $500,000 grand prize.Calkins calls such partnerships, when done right, the ""holy grail"" of marketing.And of course, M&amp;M's is already driving buzz with its splash campaign ahead of its commercial. In the teaser, Maya Rudolph, its new spokesperson, says that M&amp;M's are getting a new name, Ma&amp;Ya's, and she is replacing the brand's famed ""spokescandies.""Many speculate this is huge publicity stunt, but it's working, per TV measurement and analytics company EDO, TV viewers who saw the ad are 88% more likely to engage with the M&amp;M brand compared to the average M&amp;M ad over the last year.Taken by Yahoo Finance (Screenshot of 'Ma&amp;Ya's YouTube)Other consumer giants, including Kraft Heinz (KHC) and Hormel Foods (HRL), are skipping game-time commercials and instead launching game-themed products.Kraft Heinz introduced the LVII MEANZ 57 limited-edition Ketchup bottle, giving fans a chance to drop the the Super Bowl's traditional roman numerals.Hormel Foods created a limited-edition HORMEL Chili Cheese Brew with a small Brewing company, Modist Brewing Co., that sold out almost immediately.Adamson said traditional packaged foods don't seem to stand out on the big screen like they used to.""Those traditional packaged foods, staples, are really struggling in here with social media where people only share extraordinary...No one shares a bottle of ketchup on social media or a can of chili.

Taken simply, when more people are unemployed, price pressures are less. But on a deeper level, the so-called inverse relationship is more complicated. And it can break down. For instance, the blowout U.S. jobs numbers for January released Friday, on the back of what the Fed calls disinflation. And this week’s oil market crash on that.Historically, there has been a strong positive correlation between jobs and crude prices. And that’s quite logical. When a greater number of people have jobs and are commuting to them (notwithstanding the post-pandemic work-from-home culture), the more transportation fuels, gasoline included, would be needed to move them around.So, not surprisingly, upon release of the January nonfarm payrolls, or NFP, report from the Labor Department, crude prices rose more than 2.5% as oil bulls tried to exploit the typical connection between such data and energy demand.But the dollar’s rapid surge on the same jobs report put paid to crude’s advance.Oil eventually capsized in a sea of red with gold and other commodities as the dollar’s rebound from 10-month lows made raw materials priced in the U.S. currency costlier for non-dollar holders.Crude prices settled the week down 7%, taking global benchmark Brent to below $80 per barrel while bringing WTI, or the U.S. West Texas Intermediate, to the low $70s.It proved one thing: Good U.S. jobs numbers are no longer an assurance for higher oil prices - not when you have a rebounding dollar and rate uncertainty to contend with.According to the NFP report, some 517,000 jobs were added last month - almost three times above the forecast growth of 185,000 and against December’s number of 260,000. The outperformance threw a fresh challenge to the Federal Reserve, which had been hoping its aggressive rate hikes over the past year would have sufficiently cooled the labor market and wages to get inflation back to its target.Story continuesThe Dollar Index and yields on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, which act as contra trades against risk assets that include stocks and commodities, surged on the NFP report. They could continue rising if the Fed rethinks its plan about further consolidating rate hikes this year. The central bank went from a 50-basis point rate hike in December to 25-basis points in February.As though sensing a tougher challenge for this year, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told a news conference on Wednesday that while the pace of job gains had slowed late last year, “the labor market continues to be out of balance”.The Fed has increased rates by 450 basis points in a monetary tightening cycle that began in March 2022, two years after the coronavirus outbreak, which led to trillions of dollars in relief spending that pumped up the economy and triggered runaway inflation.Inflation, as measured by the CPI, or Consumer Price Index, hit four-decade highs in June when it expanded at 9.1% yearly. In December, the CPI grew at 6.5% per annum, its slowest since October 2021. But it was still more than three times the Fed’s target of 2% per annum.Yet, Powell saw it fit to say that “for the first time, the disinflationary process has started.”“We can see it,” he said. “We see it really in goods prices so far.”Fed maneuvers aside, oil prices were on the back foot after a sixth straight weekly build in U.S. crude, along with surpluses in fuels, reported by the EIA, or Energy Information Administration, this week.U.S. crude inventories rose by 4.14M barrels during the week ended Jan. 27, the EIA said in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report. The build was above the 0.376M forecast by industry analysts and compared with the rise of 0.533M reported by the EIA during the previous week to Jan 20.For context, the EIA has reported a total crude build of 34.5M barrels over the past six weeks. At current standing, crude stockpiles are at the highest since June 2021, said the EIA, the statistical arm of the U.S. Energy Department.On the gasoline inventory front, the EIA cited a build of 2.576M barrels, versus the forecast of 1.442M and the previous week’s rise of 1.763M.Gasoline inventories have gone up by almost 13 million barrels since 2023 began. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.Distillates stockpiles also rose, for the first time in five weeks. Here, there was a build of 2.32M barrels versus the expected deficit of 1.3M. In the previous week, distillate draws stood at 507,000 barrels.Until last week, distillates - which are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains, and ships, and fuel for jets - were the strongest component of U.S. petroleum demand. Prior to the build in the latest week, distillate stockpiles had fallen by around 5 million barrels over four weeks.""Commercial storage in North America is ample,"" Norbert Ruecker, economist at the bank Julius Baer, said in comments carried by Reuters. ""The improved market mood has lifted prices of late, but this support should remain temporary. We see lower prices longer term, in line with the futures market’s expectations.""Also weighing on the market was OPEC+’s decision this week to leave production levels unchanged and uncertainties over how well demand from China would fare in February - more than a month after the top crude importer abandoned all COVID restrictions.On China’s side, crude imports were assessed at 10.98M bpd, or barrels per day, in January, down from December's 11.37M bpd and November's 11.42M bpd, a Reuters report said Thursday. Part of the decline in Chinese imports was likely due to the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell on January 22 this year, the report added.ANZ analysts concurred with that, noting a sharp jump in traffic in China’s 15 largest cities following the Lunar New Year holiday but acknowledging that Chinese oil traders had been “relatively absent” from the market.Despite this, Asia’s total crude oil imports jumped by 11.1% month over month to 29.13 million bpd in January. The imports last month beat the previous record from November, when Asia imported 29.10 million bpd of crude oil. This is the sort of data that those long the market are counting on for a rebound of the market in the coming weeks.The European Union's new sanctions on Russian fuel products, which came into force on Sunday, could hit Moscow's energy revenue, but are unlikely to weigh on its overall production, said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler.A coalition of Group of Seven economies, the EU and Australia set caps at $100 per barrel on products that trade at a premium to crude, principally diesel, and $45 per barrel for products that trade at a discount, such as fuel oil and naphtha. The same group on Dec. 5 set a $60 cap on Russian crude oil.Like the crude price cap, the ones on Russian fuels will further weigh on the flat price of diesel and other products, even if the limits are way above selling prices, said Smith.That will fulfill another agenda of the G7 and its allies, that is seldom discussed in the media. And that is to make sure Russia’s oil and energy products reach the markets, but not at the prices the Kremlin wants.The Biden administration, particularly, is hoping the caps will force Vladimir Putin to put out even more barrels to fund his war against Ukraine. That will indirectly suppress global energy prices further - a gift to fighting inflation.Oil: Market Settlements and ActivityNew York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March had a final trade of $73.23 on Friday, after settling at $73.39 a barrel, down $2.49, or 3.2% on the day. For the week, WTI dropped by just over 7.5%. Month-to-date, the U.S. crude benchmark was also down about 7%, extending its near 9% slide over three previous months.London-traded Brent crude for March delivery registered a final trade of $79.82, after settling at $79.94, down $2.23, or 2.7%. Brent earlier hit a three-week low at $79.89. For the week, the global crude benchmark was down about 7.5%, after last week’s near 3% loss. For February thus far, Brent has lost 5.4%, extending its 6.5% slide since the end of December.Oil: Price OutlookWTI’s technicals point to a chance of a further drop below $70 per barrel in the coming week, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“Despite a previously strong upward move, WTI failed to hold temporary gains and fell from a $80.50 weekly high and closed at $73.20, well below the $76.40 and $75.50 support,” Dixit said.Any recovery towards $75.40 and $76.40 will attract sellers, resuming a decline towards the 50-month Exponential Moving Average of $71.80 and the December low of $70.10, Dixit said.The U.S. crude benchmark’s long-term support of the 200-week Simple Moving Average of $65.78 remains untested, he added.Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity Natural gas futures tumbled 21% for the week as the heating fuel continued its descent into a seemingly bottomless abyss despite the arrival of freezing weather in the key Northeastern U.S. region, which until this week had experienced an unusually warm winter.The front-month March gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub settled down 4.6 cents, or 1.8%, at $2.385 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units. The session bottom was $2.343, which marked a low not seen since Dec. 29, 2020, when it fell to $2.282.For the week, the benchmark gas futures contract lost 21%, extending to almost 65% its tumble from December’s $7 high. Prior to that, it traded at a 14-year peak of $10 in August.An unusually warm start to the 2022/23 winter has led to considerably less heating demand in the United States versus the norm, leaving more gas in storage than initially thought.At the close of last week, U.S. gas storage stood at 2.583 tcf, or trillion cubic feet, up 9.4% from the year-ago level of 2.361 tcf, data from the Energy Information Administration showed.Since the start of this week though, the weather has been colder, reaching 20 Fahrenheit (-6.7 Celsius) on Friday in New York City and some other key locations in the U.S. Northeast, which accounts for the largest heating market in the United States.Natural gas: Price Outlook“Gas has gone to extreme oversold conditions and its weekly Relative Strength Index is now at 28, matching the pattern of the 8 bearish weeks during its decline from a $10 peak to $4.75,” said Dixit of SKCharting.He said a short-term rebound from this week’s $2.35 low was a possibility, but this needs clear acceptance above $2.87 for an upside potential towards $3.30.“Sustainability below $2.87 will keep prices under pressure and trying to dig deeper.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold tumbled almost 3% on Friday after a blockbuster U.S. jobs report for January triggered profit-taking on the precious metal’s long-running rally, putting it way off the $2,000-an-ounce target eyed by bulls in the space.Gold for April delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,877.70 on Friday, after settling at $1,868.30 an ounce, down $53.90, or 2.8%. It hit a four-week low of $1,874.55 during the session.It was the first time since Jan. 12 that gold’s $1,900 support on Comex had crumbled.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, was at $1,864.93, down $47.64, or 2.49%.Gold’s plunge came as the Dollar Index and yields on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note surged after the U.S. Labor Department reported a non-farm payrolls growth for January that was almost three times above forecast, throwing a fresh challenge to the Federal Reserve’s hopes of seeing a cooling of the labor market and wages to get inflation to its target.Gold: Price Outlook Dixit noted that it took gold just two days to undo its 30-day climb from $1,860 to $1,960.“Going in to the week ahead, gold needs to hold defense at the 50-Day EMA of $1,854, failing which the metal runs the risk of a correction extending toward $1,842 and $1,828,” he said.Any recovery, meanwhile, faces challenges at $1,878-$1,885, followed by $1,900-$1,914. before retesting major resistance and supply zone at $1,929, Dixit said.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesOil falls about 3% as strong U.S. jobs data prompt interest rate concernsNatural gas hits more than 2-year low, sinks 21% for week]"

Believe it or not, there’s a technology not too far off – and it already generates profits.It’s time to take a ride with OPAL Fuels Inc. (Nasdaq: OPAL), a newly-listed company that creates renewable natural gas (RNG) from decomposing organic material in landfills as well as dairies. While OPAL can’t fuel a DeLorean, it is able to replace fossil fuels like diesel for major customers such as Amazon and UPS who operate massive fleets of trucks making countless deliveries daily.A big reason why RNG is in high demand: positive environmental impact. Using an example of a 100-truck fleet driving 100,000 miles per year per truck, annual carbon emissions for a diesel fleet is 17,000 tons, versus just 153 tons for RNG from landfills and negative 7,098 tons for RNG from dairy, according to B. Riley.The beauty of RNG is that it’s chemically identical to compressed natural gas, so it may not require new vehicle purchases to make the switch. And the existing market is huge: natural gas powers more than 175,000 vehicles in the U.S. and roughly 23 million vehicles worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.Story continuesBut even if a fleet of, say, diesel trucks needs to be replaced at a higher upfront cost, very meaningful savings comes over time via cheaper fuel expenses. RNG also burns nearly twice as cleanly as the diesel it replaces in heavy-duty trucks, providing another opportunity to limit emissions.RNG has tremendous room for growth. Current production of about 400 million gas gallon equivalents per year is less than 1% of the U.S. heavy duty fuel market. Even if supply meets forecasts and triples to roughly 1 billion gas gallon equivalents in five years, it would still be less than 3% of the U.S. heavy duty fuel market.RNG is also easy to move around. It can be sent to many end markets using existing natural gas pipelines across the country. It can even be sent to Europe – or farther if needed – by ship.And while many companies in the electric vehicle industry have yet to deliver batteries, or various other components of the supply chain, OPAL has been selling fuel for over a decade. Current fueling-station customers include giants Waste Management and Amazon, who have an average contract length of 10 years.OPAL landed another big contract in December, when it said it signed a 10-year deal with UPS to provide operations and maintenance services at 51 fueling centers nationwide. Long-term deals with such behemoths – and a wide variety of them – should give investors assurance in OPAL’s predictable revenue over time.Such customers also find RNG to be a great choice over other next-generation options. Battery technology, for instance, is still years away from powering heavy, long-distance vehicles at any significant scale. The Department of Transportation has serious weight limits that would require big trucks to sacrifice valuable cargo space.And while the likes of Nikola tout hydrogen, it’s even further away from practical use and hydrogen fuel stations will take many years to build out. It can also be dangerous: hydrogen is known to cause fires or explosions if not handled properly.An important key to the OPAL story is vertical integration, meaning it captures RNG itself and delivers it all the way to vehicles at its own fueling stations. Having access to its own RNG should help OPAL keep winning market share over time because buyers can have faith in available supply.Vertical integration has even more benefits. OPAL can save on third-party costs, offer better terms to transportation customers, and likely attract partners seeking valuable government credits for reducing carbon emissions.OPAL itself benefits from a bevy of government incentives – though it could be profitable without the extra help. One important boost comes from renewable identification numbers (RINs), which are credits used as a currency in the EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard Program. It could also benefit from so-called eRINs, which may be generated from a project using a renewable fuel to power EVs. Provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act could offer even more benefits.OPAL sources RNG from two key sources: landfills and dairies. Landfills have also been used source electricity but far more energy – four times the amount – can be extracted going the RNG route.And while landfills are OPAL’s main focus, it also works with dairies, which generate massive amounts of methane, a problematic greenhouse gas. Indeed, methane is 60-70 times worse for the ozone layer than carbon dioxide.Turning to financials, the company looks rock solid – unlike many recent IPOs. It has virtually no net debt and liquidity of $329 million. There’s also $115 million in undrawn cash under a credit facility.That flexibility is important as the company continues to build out new plants. It currently has six RNG facilities in operation and seven more under development.The company is already very profitable, with an estimate of $60 million – $63 million in Ebitda for 2022. Analysts expect that to more-than quadruple to $264 million in 2025, according to Sentieo, an AI-enabled research platform.At $7.20 a share, OPAL trades at 4.7 times consensus 2025 Ebitda. Ameresco, Inc., meanwhile, commands a multiple of 11.9 times. B. Riley recently issued a $14 price target, reflecting an 8.5x EV/EBITDA multiple on the broker’s own 2025 estimate.At least some of that discount is beyond OPAL’s control as investors have shunned new IPOs across the board. But with profits, vertical integration and visibility over many years though the clean-energy transition, it shouldn’t be hard for savvy investors to see the glimmer in OPAL.Contact:IPO Edgewww.IPO-Edge.comEditor@IPO-Edge.com]"

If you want to see more best January dividend stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best January Dividend Stocks to Buy.While January might be over, many dividend stocks aren't done paying their dividends for 2023.Considering many dividend stocks pay dividends quarterly, many of the same companies that paid a dividend in January will pay another dividend in April.If the company has the profits or the financial resources to do so, some of those companies might even raise their quarterly dividends during that time. Some of the same companies could also buy back stock as another form of return of excess capital in the mean time too.Good dividend stocks are not necessarily the ones that have a lot of upside, as many stocks that have a lot of upside also have a lot of downside. In terms of January, the S&amp;P 500 rallied 6.6% for the month as fourth quarter U.S. GDP was slightly stronger than expected and as the Federal Reserve indicated that the ""disinflationary process has started"" after 2022's substantial interest rate increases.While macroeconomic conditions are looking better than they did before, economic data can always miss estimates. If inflation increases more than expected, growth slows more than expected, the Federal Reserve tightens more than expected, or a number of other things, the market could always decline and individual stocks could always decline.Instead good dividend stocks have relatively more stability, substantial competitive advantages, and considerable normalized earnings power. With competitive advantages and substantial normalized earnings power, those companies are more likely to maintain or even increase their dividends over time if they maintain their market shares. While the best dividend stocks also have downside, the hope is that those companies' strong competitive advantages and dividend returns will limit the downside in the long term.Story continuesGiven 2023 could also be a volatile year, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Jasni/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best January Dividend Stocks to Buy, we took all the stocks that had ex-dividend dates in January and filtered for only leading consumer staples stocks with substantial competitive advantages or leading companies with considerable scale.We then ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares of the same stock at the end of the third quarter.In terms of record date and ex-dividend dates, Investor.gov writes,""When a company declares a dividend, it sets a record date when you must be on the company's books as a shareholder to receive the dividend. Companies also use this date to determine who is sent proxy statements, financial reports, and other information. Once the company sets the record date, the ex-dividend date is set based on stock exchange rules. The ex-dividend date for stocks is usually set one business day before the record date. If you purchase a stock on its ex-dividend date or after, you will not receive the next dividend payment. Instead, the seller gets the dividend. If you purchase before the ex-dividend date, you get the dividend.""Every company is different so investors should always check to see company specific circumstances for every dividend payment.10 Best January Dividend Stocks to Buy10.

Taken simply, when more people are unemployed, price pressures are less. But on a deeper level, the so-called inverse relationship is more complicated. And it can break down. For instance, the blowout U.S. jobs numbers for January released Friday, on the back of what the Fed calls disinflation. And this week’s oil market crash on that.Historically, there has been a strong positive correlation between jobs and crude prices. And that’s quite logical. When a greater number of people have jobs and are commuting to them (notwithstanding the post-pandemic work-from-home culture), the more transportation fuels, gasoline included, would be needed to move them around.So, not surprisingly, upon release of the January nonfarm payrolls, or NFP, report from the Labor Department, crude prices rose more than 2.5% as oil bulls tried to exploit the typical connection between such data and energy demand.But the dollar’s rapid surge on the same jobs report put paid to crude’s advance.Oil eventually capsized in a sea of red with gold and other commodities as the dollar’s rebound from 10-month lows made raw materials priced in the U.S. currency costlier for non-dollar holders.Crude prices settled the week down 7%, taking global benchmark Brent to below $80 per barrel while bringing WTI, or the U.S. West Texas Intermediate, to the low $70s.It proved one thing: Good U.S. jobs numbers are no longer an assurance for higher oil prices - not when you have a rebounding dollar and rate uncertainty to contend with.According to the NFP report, some 517,000 jobs were added last month - almost three times above the forecast growth of 185,000 and against December’s number of 260,000. The outperformance threw a fresh challenge to the Federal Reserve, which had been hoping its aggressive rate hikes over the past year would have sufficiently cooled the labor market and wages to get inflation back to its target.Story continuesThe Dollar Index and yields on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, which act as contra trades against risk assets that include stocks and commodities, surged on the NFP report. They could continue rising if the Fed rethinks its plan about further consolidating rate hikes this year. The central bank went from a 50-basis point rate hike in December to 25-basis points in February.As though sensing a tougher challenge for this year, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told a news conference on Wednesday that while the pace of job gains had slowed late last year, “the labor market continues to be out of balance”.The Fed has increased rates by 450 basis points in a monetary tightening cycle that began in March 2022, two years after the coronavirus outbreak, which led to trillions of dollars in relief spending that pumped up the economy and triggered runaway inflation.Inflation, as measured by the CPI, or Consumer Price Index, hit four-decade highs in June when it expanded at 9.1% yearly. In December, the CPI grew at 6.5% per annum, its slowest since October 2021. But it was still more than three times the Fed’s target of 2% per annum.Yet, Powell saw it fit to say that “for the first time, the disinflationary process has started.”“We can see it,” he said. “We see it really in goods prices so far.”Fed maneuvers aside, oil prices were on the back foot after a sixth straight weekly build in U.S. crude, along with surpluses in fuels, reported by the EIA, or Energy Information Administration, this week.U.S. crude inventories rose by 4.14M barrels during the week ended Jan. 27, the EIA said in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report. The build was above the 0.376M forecast by industry analysts and compared with the rise of 0.533M reported by the EIA during the previous week to Jan 20.For context, the EIA has reported a total crude build of 34.5M barrels over the past six weeks. At current standing, crude stockpiles are at the highest since June 2021, said the EIA, the statistical arm of the U.S. Energy Department.On the gasoline inventory front, the EIA cited a build of 2.576M barrels, versus the forecast of 1.442M and the previous week’s rise of 1.763M.Gasoline inventories have gone up by almost 13 million barrels since 2023 began. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.Distillates stockpiles also rose, for the first time in five weeks. Here, there was a build of 2.32M barrels versus the expected deficit of 1.3M. In the previous week, distillate draws stood at 507,000 barrels.Until last week, distillates - which are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains, and ships, and fuel for jets - were the strongest component of U.S. petroleum demand. Prior to the build in the latest week, distillate stockpiles had fallen by around 5 million barrels over four weeks.""Commercial storage in North America is ample,"" Norbert Ruecker, economist at the bank Julius Baer, said in comments carried by Reuters. ""The improved market mood has lifted prices of late, but this support should remain temporary. We see lower prices longer term, in line with the futures market’s expectations.""Also weighing on the market was OPEC+’s decision this week to leave production levels unchanged and uncertainties over how well demand from China would fare in February - more than a month after the top crude importer abandoned all COVID restrictions.On China’s side, crude imports were assessed at 10.98M bpd, or barrels per day, in January, down from December's 11.37M bpd and November's 11.42M bpd, a Reuters report said Thursday. Part of the decline in Chinese imports was likely due to the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell on January 22 this year, the report added.ANZ analysts concurred with that, noting a sharp jump in traffic in China’s 15 largest cities following the Lunar New Year holiday but acknowledging that Chinese oil traders had been “relatively absent” from the market.Despite this, Asia’s total crude oil imports jumped by 11.1% month over month to 29.13 million bpd in January. The imports last month beat the previous record from November, when Asia imported 29.10 million bpd of crude oil. This is the sort of data that those long the market are counting on for a rebound of the market in the coming weeks.The European Union's new sanctions on Russian fuel products, which came into force on Sunday, could hit Moscow's energy revenue, but are unlikely to weigh on its overall production, said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler.A coalition of Group of Seven economies, the EU and Australia set caps at $100 per barrel on products that trade at a premium to crude, principally diesel, and $45 per barrel for products that trade at a discount, such as fuel oil and naphtha. The same group on Dec. 5 set a $60 cap on Russian crude oil.Like the crude price cap, the ones on Russian fuels will further weigh on the flat price of diesel and other products, even if the limits are way above selling prices, said Smith.That will fulfill another agenda of the G7 and its allies, that is seldom discussed in the media. And that is to make sure Russia’s oil and energy products reach the markets, but not at the prices the Kremlin wants.The Biden administration, particularly, is hoping the caps will force Vladimir Putin to put out even more barrels to fund his war against Ukraine. That will indirectly suppress global energy prices further - a gift to fighting inflation.Oil: Market Settlements and ActivityNew York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March had a final trade of $73.23 on Friday, after settling at $73.39 a barrel, down $2.49, or 3.2% on the day. For the week, WTI dropped by just over 7.5%. Month-to-date, the U.S. crude benchmark was also down about 7%, extending its near 9% slide over three previous months.London-traded Brent crude for March delivery registered a final trade of $79.82, after settling at $79.94, down $2.23, or 2.7%. Brent earlier hit a three-week low at $79.89. For the week, the global crude benchmark was down about 7.5%, after last week’s near 3% loss. For February thus far, Brent has lost 5.4%, extending its 6.5% slide since the end of December.Oil: Price OutlookWTI’s technicals point to a chance of a further drop below $70 per barrel in the coming week, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“Despite a previously strong upward move, WTI failed to hold temporary gains and fell from a $80.50 weekly high and closed at $73.20, well below the $76.40 and $75.50 support,” Dixit said.Any recovery towards $75.40 and $76.40 will attract sellers, resuming a decline towards the 50-month Exponential Moving Average of $71.80 and the December low of $70.10, Dixit said.The U.S. crude benchmark’s long-term support of the 200-week Simple Moving Average of $65.78 remains untested, he added.Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity Natural gas futures tumbled 21% for the week as the heating fuel continued its descent into a seemingly bottomless abyss despite the arrival of freezing weather in the key Northeastern U.S. region, which until this week had experienced an unusually warm winter.The front-month March gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub settled down 4.6 cents, or 1.8%, at $2.385 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units. The session bottom was $2.343, which marked a low not seen since Dec. 29, 2020, when it fell to $2.282.For the week, the benchmark gas futures contract lost 21%, extending to almost 65% its tumble from December’s $7 high. Prior to that, it traded at a 14-year peak of $10 in August.An unusually warm start to the 2022/23 winter has led to considerably less heating demand in the United States versus the norm, leaving more gas in storage than initially thought.At the close of last week, U.S. gas storage stood at 2.583 tcf, or trillion cubic feet, up 9.4% from the year-ago level of 2.361 tcf, data from the Energy Information Administration showed.Since the start of this week though, the weather has been colder, reaching 20 Fahrenheit (-6.7 Celsius) on Friday in New York City and some other key locations in the U.S. Northeast, which accounts for the largest heating market in the United States.Natural gas: Price Outlook“Gas has gone to extreme oversold conditions and its weekly Relative Strength Index is now at 28, matching the pattern of the 8 bearish weeks during its decline from a $10 peak to $4.75,” said Dixit of SKCharting.He said a short-term rebound from this week’s $2.35 low was a possibility, but this needs clear acceptance above $2.87 for an upside potential towards $3.30.“Sustainability below $2.87 will keep prices under pressure and trying to dig deeper.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold tumbled almost 3% on Friday after a blockbuster U.S. jobs report for January triggered profit-taking on the precious metal’s long-running rally, putting it way off the $2,000-an-ounce target eyed by bulls in the space.Gold for April delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,877.70 on Friday, after settling at $1,868.30 an ounce, down $53.90, or 2.8%. It hit a four-week low of $1,874.55 during the session.It was the first time since Jan. 12 that gold’s $1,900 support on Comex had crumbled.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, was at $1,864.93, down $47.64, or 2.49%.Gold’s plunge came as the Dollar Index and yields on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note surged after the U.S. Labor Department reported a non-farm payrolls growth for January that was almost three times above forecast, throwing a fresh challenge to the Federal Reserve’s hopes of seeing a cooling of the labor market and wages to get inflation to its target.Gold: Price Outlook Dixit noted that it took gold just two days to undo its 30-day climb from $1,860 to $1,960.“Going in to the week ahead, gold needs to hold defense at the 50-Day EMA of $1,854, failing which the metal runs the risk of a correction extending toward $1,842 and $1,828,” he said.Any recovery, meanwhile, faces challenges at $1,878-$1,885, followed by $1,900-$1,914. before retesting major resistance and supply zone at $1,929, Dixit said.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesOil falls about 3% as strong U.S. jobs data prompt interest rate concernsNatural gas hits more than 2-year low, sinks 21% for week]"

(Nasdaq: OPAL) provides renewable natural gas (RNG)RNG is chemically identical to compressed natural gas, burns twice as clean as dieselVertically integrated, beginning with source in landfills, dairies where biogas is releasedVertical integration creates massive cost savings, allowing OPAL to capture full value of RNGAlso 2nd largest operator of RNG stations in the U.S., serving fleets and individual vehiclesRecently inked 10-year deal with UPS to provide operations and maintenance services at 51 fueling centers nationwideOpened Florida’s 1st landfill-gas to RNG facility, uses biogas from decomposing materialNew facility to produce 5 million gasoline gallon equivalent of RNG annuallyStrong balance sheet clears the way for growth through several new projectsTrades at just 4.7x 2025 consensus Ebitda, sharply lower than comparable companiesBy John JannaroneIn the 1989 classic Back to the Future Part II, Doctor Emmett Brown fuels up his time-traveling DeLorean not with dangerously radioactive plutonium, but a banana peel and stale Miller beer. Believe it or not, there’s a technology not too far off – and it already generates profits.It’s time to take a ride with OPAL Fuels Inc. (Nasdaq: OPAL), a newly-listed company that creates renewable natural gas (RNG) from decomposing organic material in landfills as well as dairies. While OPAL can’t fuel a DeLorean, it is able to replace fossil fuels like diesel for major customers such as Amazon and UPS who operate massive fleets of trucks making countless deliveries daily.A big reason why RNG is in high demand: positive environmental impact. Using an example of a 100-truck fleet driving 100,000 miles per year per truck, annual carbon emissions for a diesel fleet is 17,000 tons, versus just 153 tons for RNG from landfills and negative 7,098 tons for RNG from dairy, according to B. Riley.The beauty of RNG is that it’s chemically identical to compressed natural gas, so it may not require new vehicle purchases to make the switch. And the existing market is huge: natural gas powers more than 175,000 vehicles in the U.S. and roughly 23 million vehicles worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.Story continuesBut even if a fleet of, say, diesel trucks needs to be replaced at a higher upfront cost, very meaningful savings comes over time via cheaper fuel expenses. RNG also burns nearly twice as cleanly as the diesel it replaces in heavy-duty trucks, providing another opportunity to limit emissions.RNG has tremendous room for growth. Current production of about 400 million gas gallon equivalents per year is less than 1% of the U.S. heavy duty fuel market. Even if supply meets forecasts and triples to roughly 1 billion gas gallon equivalents in five years, it would still be less than 3% of the U.S. heavy duty fuel market.RNG is also easy to move around. It can be sent to many end markets using existing natural gas pipelines across the country. It can even be sent to Europe – or farther if needed – by ship.And while many companies in the electric vehicle industry have yet to deliver batteries, or various other components of the supply chain, OPAL has been selling fuel for over a decade. Current fueling-station customers include giants Waste Management and Amazon, who have an average contract length of 10 years.OPAL landed another big contract in December, when it said it signed a 10-year deal with UPS to provide operations and maintenance services at 51 fueling centers nationwide. Long-term deals with such behemoths – and a wide variety of them – should give investors assurance in OPAL’s predictable revenue over time.Such customers also find RNG to be a great choice over other next-generation options. Battery technology, for instance, is still years away from powering heavy, long-distance vehicles at any significant scale. The Department of Transportation has serious weight limits that would require big trucks to sacrifice valuable cargo space.And while the likes of Nikola tout hydrogen, it’s even further away from practical use and hydrogen fuel stations will take many years to build out. It can also be dangerous: hydrogen is known to cause fires or explosions if not handled properly.An important key to the OPAL story is vertical integration, meaning it captures RNG itself and delivers it all the way to vehicles at its own fueling stations. Having access to its own RNG should help OPAL keep winning market share over time because buyers can have faith in available supply.Vertical integration has even more benefits. OPAL can save on third-party costs, offer better terms to transportation customers, and likely attract partners seeking valuable government credits for reducing carbon emissions.OPAL itself benefits from a bevy of government incentives – though it could be profitable without the extra help. One important boost comes from renewable identification numbers (RINs), which are credits used as a currency in the EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard Program. It could also benefit from so-called eRINs, which may be generated from a project using a renewable fuel to power EVs. Provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act could offer even more benefits.OPAL sources RNG from two key sources: landfills and dairies. Landfills have also been used source electricity but far more energy – four times the amount – can be extracted going the RNG route.And while landfills are OPAL’s main focus, it also works with dairies, which generate massive amounts of methane, a problematic greenhouse gas. Indeed, methane is 60-70 times worse for the ozone layer than carbon dioxide.Turning to financials, the company looks rock solid – unlike many recent IPOs. It has virtually no net debt and liquidity of $329 million. There’s also $115 million in undrawn cash under a credit facility.That flexibility is important as the company continues to build out new plants. It currently has six RNG facilities in operation and seven more under development.The company is already very profitable, with an estimate of $60 million – $63 million in Ebitda for 2022. Analysts expect that to more-than quadruple to $264 million in 2025, according to Sentieo, an AI-enabled research platform.At $7.20 a share, OPAL trades at 4.7 times consensus 2025 Ebitda. Ameresco, Inc., meanwhile, commands a multiple of 11.9 times. B. Riley recently issued a $14 price target, reflecting an 8.5x EV/EBITDA multiple on the broker’s own 2025 estimate.At least some of that discount is beyond OPAL’s control as investors have shunned new IPOs across the board. But with profits, vertical integration and visibility over many years though the clean-energy transition, it shouldn’t be hard for savvy investors to see the glimmer in OPAL.Contact:IPO Edgewww.IPO-Edge.comEditor@IPO-Edge.com]"

But that is minimal compensation for the share price under-performance over the last year. The cold reality is that the stock has dropped 16% in one year, under-performing the market.Although the past week has been more reassuring for shareholders, they're still in the red over the last year, so let's see if the underlying business has been responsible for the decline. Check out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Unfortunately Wells Fargo reported an EPS drop of 36% for the last year. The share price fall of 16% isn't as bad as the reduction in earnings per share. So the market may not be too worried about the EPS figure, at the moment -- or it may have expected earnings to drop faster.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Wells Fargo, it has a TSR of -13% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 8.1% in the twelve months, Wells Fargo shareholders did even worse, losing 13% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 0.4% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

It claims that those offerings differentiated its technology from the competition, but it still is among the tech stocks to sell now.On the surface, the revenue growth looks healthy. However, it rose because IBM keeps acquiring new businesses. Growth by acquisitions is not a sustainable business model when business conditions risk worsening. The potential for a recession will pressure IBM to cut costs further.The company will cut 1.5% of its workforce or 3,900 jobs. To achieve a calendar 2023 cash flow of $10.5 billion, IBM may need to reduce its headcount even more. It realized free cash growth from favorable cash tax payments and lower payments for structural actions. However, it spent $2.3 billion to buy eight companies across the software and consulting sectors.Shareholders might lose patience waiting for IBM to achieve higher working capital efficiency. Recurring revenue from software may slow as corporate customers find ways to cut their costs.Story continuesLogitech International (LOGI)Two receivers for wireless Logitech (LOGI) devices, plugged into a laptop computer.Source: Somphop Krittayaworagul / Shutterstock.comLogitech International (NASDAQ:LOGI) thrived during the 2020-21 pandemic. When the lockdown ended, computer gamers did not need to buy mouse and keyboard peripherals.The company posted revenue slumping by 22.1% to $1.27 billion in its fiscal third quarter. During the all-important holiday season, Logitech’s introduction of new products did not perform well.Logitech has 20 new products announced or launched. CEO Bracken Darrell said that G Cloud is a narrow launch, available only in the U.S. first. It will release the platform in Europe and Japan next. Shareholders are taking a risk holding the stock as margin pressures rise.Inventories stood at $104.5 million. Despite the CEO pointing out the sequential decline, Logitech might need aggressive promotions to sell the excess inventory. This would weaken its operating margins.Logitech’s discount promotions may not increase sales. Customers may easily find inexpensive substitutes for computer peripherals. Trading at a premium P/E of 22.7 times, this is one of the no-brainer tech stocks to sell.Marvell Tech (MRVL)image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campusSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comMarvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a semiconductor company. Vice-President of Investor Relations Ashish Saran said that it will take a few quarters to return to the $800 million in annualized revenue from the storage division.The need for storage changed during this product cycle. Previously, personal computer owners needed to switch from hard disks to solid-state drives. This time, cloud customers and data center operations will buy more SSD units later this year. Before that happens, the industry needs to work through the excess inventory.Marvell has next-generation PCI Generation 5 and Generation 6 rolling out in the next few years. However, investors may consider Marvell as a stock to sell from here. They do not want to invest in short-term uncertainty while waiting for the product launch.Micron Technology (MU)An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock.Source: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.comMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a memory chip supplier. In its last quarterly report, it posted revenue falling by almost $2 billion, down by 46.8% Y/Y. In the next quarter, the company expects to lose 62 cents a share.Micron has plenty of cash that it will use to buy back shares. This will minimize the downside for MU stock but is not enough to stop investors from selling their shares. The company will slow its cash outflow by sending less on capital expenditure. It will delay wafer starts. This will reduce the oversupply of chips on the market.Tech investors are wary of betting on companies that are not growing. This is a stock to sell while Micron manages the excess inventory, which it expects to peak in the current quarter. It may slash prices, which pressures operating margins.Consider avoiding or selling MU stock until supply and demand reach an equilibrium in the mid-year.Palantir Technologies (PLTR)Palantir (PLTR) logo in a smartphone with a series of stock charts on the background.Source: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.comPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) posted revenue growth of 22% Y/Y in the third quarter. Customer count grew by 66% Y/Y, which looks impressive at first. Losses mounted on a GAAP basis, compared to a one-cent profit non-GAAP.Palantir lost $123.87 million in the last quarter. When the tech sector traded at frothy levels three years ago, markets could forgive Palantir paying for growth. Today, tech investors are less willing to speculate on companies that lose money as revenue grows. This is not a sustainable business model. The firm may need to sell shares or issue debt to cover the losses.Palantir needs to prove its software offering is unmatched by the competition. Until it announces contract deals with sizable dollar amounts, PLTR stock is pure speculation.Redfin (RDFN)Redfin sign posted in front of a house for sale; Redfin (RDFN) is a real estate brokerage whose business model is based on sellers paying Redfin a small feeSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comRedfin (NASDAQ:RDFN) is a software real estate company. In the third quarter, it posted a GAAP EPS loss of 83 cents. Shareholders will not catch a break from the loss. In the fourth quarter, Redfin expects to report an EBITDA loss of between $58 million and $71 million.To reduce expenses, Redfin wound down RedfinNow, a home-flipping service. This includes a workforce reduction of 13% of staff. The housing market has major headwinds after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates throughout 2022. Home buyers have hope. Mortgage rates fell to their lowest point in four months.Real estate transactions might stabilize with better mortgage rates. Yet Redfin has to invest heavily in digital revenue streams. Gross margins per visit will not increase enough if real estate rebounds only slightly. In the near-term, cost cuts related to its headquarters and operations will not help the stock rebound.Wolfspeed (WOLF)WOLF stock: Person holding smartphone with logo of US semiconductor company Wolfspeed Inc. on screen in front of website.

It expects to lose $81 million to $88 million in the third quarter.Wolfspeed expects a weakening business momentum. It used to forecast strong revenue expectations from its materials business. Chief Financial Officer Reynolds said that the company benefits from strong demand in the power devices and materials sector. This is offset by radio frequency markets weakening in the last quarter. Customers are pushing back orders.Yields from 150 nanometers fell. Wolfspeed resolved those issues, only to face longer cycle times and higher inventory. Shipping rates also slowed, hurting revenue recognition. Equipment spare parts shortages limited output at its Durham fab.Wolfspeed is a tech stock to sell. The stock trades at a forward P/E of over 100 times. Shares are overpriced at these levels.

A multitude of corporations are targeting the football field, aiming to reap substantial rewards from their high-profile, multi-million dollar advertisements featuring famous stars.A typical 00:30 second spot runs about $7 million this year. That's up from $2.5 million in 2010, according to Timothy Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management who tracks the numbers each year. He says the cost only goes up from there.""If you're going to do the 00:60 second spot, let's call that $14 [million], let's put $2 million in production...$2 million on social media... and $2 million on other promotions,"" he said, with a grand total ""easily at $20 [million].""Companies aren't waiting for kick-off for their ROI. Calkins said that advertisers ""should already have recouped [their] investment before the game actually starts"" by building up excitement.""It's not just releasing a teaser spot. For many advertisers, they will announce that they have a Super Bowl spot, and then they will announce that they're using a particular celebrity, and then they will announce that they are going to feature this creative idea,"" Calkins said.Bud Light (BUD) turned to Miles and Keleigh Teller to engage the next-gen audience.

In the co-branded campaign, Ferrell drives GM EVs through various Netflix shows, including ""Stranger Things,"" ""Love is Blind,"" and a ""Squid Game.""Meanwhile, Michelob ULTRA showcased a beer tap emerging out of a golf bag with a TV on it. On the screen is Netflix's new ""Full Swing"" the documentary, showing a brief clip of the show that is set to debut on February 15.Story continuesAllen Adamson, co-founder of the marketing and brand consultant company Metaforce, said both companies were likely trying to differentiate themselves from other companies.""By trying to be closer to the Netflix's hipness and current buzz among consumers, whatever programming it is...advertisers are hoping to break out of the sea of sameness where everyone is doing the same.""Another partnership this year is Molson Coors (TAP) joining forces with sports betting platform Draft Kings (DKNG). Consumers are encouraged to bet on details of the spot ahead of the game for the chance to win a $500,000 grand prize.Calkins calls such partnerships, when done right, the ""holy grail"" of marketing.And of course, M&amp;M's is already driving buzz with its splash campaign ahead of its commercial. In the teaser, Maya Rudolph, its new spokesperson, says that M&amp;M's are getting a new name, Ma&amp;Ya's, and she is replacing the brand's famed ""spokescandies.""Many speculate this is huge publicity stunt, but it's working, per TV measurement and analytics company EDO, TV viewers who saw the ad are 88% more likely to engage with the M&amp;M brand compared to the average M&amp;M ad over the last year.Taken by Yahoo Finance (Screenshot of 'Ma&amp;Ya's YouTube)Other consumer giants, including Kraft Heinz (KHC) and Hormel Foods (HRL), are skipping game-time commercials and instead launching game-themed products.Kraft Heinz introduced the LVII MEANZ 57 limited-edition Ketchup bottle, giving fans a chance to drop the the Super Bowl's traditional roman numerals.Hormel Foods created a limited-edition HORMEL Chili Cheese Brew with a small Brewing company, Modist Brewing Co., that sold out almost immediately.Adamson said traditional packaged foods don't seem to stand out on the big screen like they used to.""Those traditional packaged foods, staples, are really struggling in here with social media where people only share extraordinary...No one shares a bottle of ketchup on social media or a can of chili.

(NASDAQ:ISRG) institutional owners must be relieved by the recent gain",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/losing-11-past-intuitive-surgical-120022817.html,1675598422.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Every investor in Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 85% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Last week's US$2.6b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 11% losses.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Intuitive Surgical. See our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuitive Surgical?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Intuitive Surgical does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Intuitive Surgical, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Intuitive Surgical. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.3% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.9% and 6.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Intuitive SurgicalWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$411m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in Intuitive Surgical. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth.

Taken simply, when more people are unemployed, price pressures are less. But on a deeper level, the so-called inverse relationship is more complicated. And it can break down. For instance, the blowout U.S. jobs numbers for January released Friday, on the back of what the Fed calls disinflation. And this week’s oil market crash on that.Historically, there has been a strong positive correlation between jobs and crude prices. And that’s quite logical. When a greater number of people have jobs and are commuting to them (notwithstanding the post-pandemic work-from-home culture), the more transportation fuels, gasoline included, would be needed to move them around.So, not surprisingly, upon release of the January nonfarm payrolls, or NFP, report from the Labor Department, crude prices rose more than 2.5% as oil bulls tried to exploit the typical connection between such data and energy demand.But the dollar’s rapid surge on the same jobs report put paid to crude’s advance.Oil eventually capsized in a sea of red with gold and other commodities as the dollar’s rebound from 10-month lows made raw materials priced in the U.S. currency costlier for non-dollar holders.Crude prices settled the week down 7%, taking global benchmark Brent to below $80 per barrel while bringing WTI, or the U.S. West Texas Intermediate, to the low $70s.It proved one thing: Good U.S. jobs numbers are no longer an assurance for higher oil prices - not when you have a rebounding dollar and rate uncertainty to contend with.According to the NFP report, some 517,000 jobs were added last month - almost three times above the forecast growth of 185,000 and against December’s number of 260,000. The outperformance threw a fresh challenge to the Federal Reserve, which had been hoping its aggressive rate hikes over the past year would have sufficiently cooled the labor market and wages to get inflation back to its target.Story continuesThe Dollar Index and yields on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, which act as contra trades against risk assets that include stocks and commodities, surged on the NFP report. They could continue rising if the Fed rethinks its plan about further consolidating rate hikes this year. The central bank went from a 50-basis point rate hike in December to 25-basis points in February.As though sensing a tougher challenge for this year, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told a news conference on Wednesday that while the pace of job gains had slowed late last year, “the labor market continues to be out of balance”.The Fed has increased rates by 450 basis points in a monetary tightening cycle that began in March 2022, two years after the coronavirus outbreak, which led to trillions of dollars in relief spending that pumped up the economy and triggered runaway inflation.Inflation, as measured by the CPI, or Consumer Price Index, hit four-decade highs in June when it expanded at 9.1% yearly. In December, the CPI grew at 6.5% per annum, its slowest since October 2021. But it was still more than three times the Fed’s target of 2% per annum.Yet, Powell saw it fit to say that “for the first time, the disinflationary process has started.”“We can see it,” he said. “We see it really in goods prices so far.”Fed maneuvers aside, oil prices were on the back foot after a sixth straight weekly build in U.S. crude, along with surpluses in fuels, reported by the EIA, or Energy Information Administration, this week.U.S. crude inventories rose by 4.14M barrels during the week ended Jan. 27, the EIA said in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report. The build was above the 0.376M forecast by industry analysts and compared with the rise of 0.533M reported by the EIA during the previous week to Jan 20.For context, the EIA has reported a total crude build of 34.5M barrels over the past six weeks. At current standing, crude stockpiles are at the highest since June 2021, said the EIA, the statistical arm of the U.S. Energy Department.On the gasoline inventory front, the EIA cited a build of 2.576M barrels, versus the forecast of 1.442M and the previous week’s rise of 1.763M.Gasoline inventories have gone up by almost 13 million barrels since 2023 began. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.Distillates stockpiles also rose, for the first time in five weeks. Here, there was a build of 2.32M barrels versus the expected deficit of 1.3M. In the previous week, distillate draws stood at 507,000 barrels.Until last week, distillates - which are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains, and ships, and fuel for jets - were the strongest component of U.S. petroleum demand. Prior to the build in the latest week, distillate stockpiles had fallen by around 5 million barrels over four weeks.""Commercial storage in North America is ample,"" Norbert Ruecker, economist at the bank Julius Baer, said in comments carried by Reuters. ""The improved market mood has lifted prices of late, but this support should remain temporary. We see lower prices longer term, in line with the futures market’s expectations.""Also weighing on the market was OPEC+’s decision this week to leave production levels unchanged and uncertainties over how well demand from China would fare in February - more than a month after the top crude importer abandoned all COVID restrictions.On China’s side, crude imports were assessed at 10.98M bpd, or barrels per day, in January, down from December's 11.37M bpd and November's 11.42M bpd, a Reuters report said Thursday. Part of the decline in Chinese imports was likely due to the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell on January 22 this year, the report added.ANZ analysts concurred with that, noting a sharp jump in traffic in China’s 15 largest cities following the Lunar New Year holiday but acknowledging that Chinese oil traders had been “relatively absent” from the market.Despite this, Asia’s total crude oil imports jumped by 11.1% month over month to 29.13 million bpd in January. The imports last month beat the previous record from November, when Asia imported 29.10 million bpd of crude oil. This is the sort of data that those long the market are counting on for a rebound of the market in the coming weeks.The European Union's new sanctions on Russian fuel products, which came into force on Sunday, could hit Moscow's energy revenue, but are unlikely to weigh on its overall production, said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler.A coalition of Group of Seven economies, the EU and Australia set caps at $100 per barrel on products that trade at a premium to crude, principally diesel, and $45 per barrel for products that trade at a discount, such as fuel oil and naphtha. The same group on Dec. 5 set a $60 cap on Russian crude oil.Like the crude price cap, the ones on Russian fuels will further weigh on the flat price of diesel and other products, even if the limits are way above selling prices, said Smith.That will fulfill another agenda of the G7 and its allies, that is seldom discussed in the media. And that is to make sure Russia’s oil and energy products reach the markets, but not at the prices the Kremlin wants.The Biden administration, particularly, is hoping the caps will force Vladimir Putin to put out even more barrels to fund his war against Ukraine. That will indirectly suppress global energy prices further - a gift to fighting inflation.Oil: Market Settlements and ActivityNew York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for March had a final trade of $73.23 on Friday, after settling at $73.39 a barrel, down $2.49, or 3.2% on the day. For the week, WTI dropped by just over 7.5%. Month-to-date, the U.S. crude benchmark was also down about 7%, extending its near 9% slide over three previous months.London-traded Brent crude for March delivery registered a final trade of $79.82, after settling at $79.94, down $2.23, or 2.7%. Brent earlier hit a three-week low at $79.89. For the week, the global crude benchmark was down about 7.5%, after last week’s near 3% loss. For February thus far, Brent has lost 5.4%, extending its 6.5% slide since the end of December.Oil: Price OutlookWTI’s technicals point to a chance of a further drop below $70 per barrel in the coming week, said Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com.“Despite a previously strong upward move, WTI failed to hold temporary gains and fell from a $80.50 weekly high and closed at $73.20, well below the $76.40 and $75.50 support,” Dixit said.Any recovery towards $75.40 and $76.40 will attract sellers, resuming a decline towards the 50-month Exponential Moving Average of $71.80 and the December low of $70.10, Dixit said.The U.S. crude benchmark’s long-term support of the 200-week Simple Moving Average of $65.78 remains untested, he added.Natural gas: Market Settlements and Activity Natural gas futures tumbled 21% for the week as the heating fuel continued its descent into a seemingly bottomless abyss despite the arrival of freezing weather in the key Northeastern U.S. region, which until this week had experienced an unusually warm winter.The front-month March gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub settled down 4.6 cents, or 1.8%, at $2.385 per mmBtu, or million metric British thermal units. The session bottom was $2.343, which marked a low not seen since Dec. 29, 2020, when it fell to $2.282.For the week, the benchmark gas futures contract lost 21%, extending to almost 65% its tumble from December’s $7 high. Prior to that, it traded at a 14-year peak of $10 in August.An unusually warm start to the 2022/23 winter has led to considerably less heating demand in the United States versus the norm, leaving more gas in storage than initially thought.At the close of last week, U.S. gas storage stood at 2.583 tcf, or trillion cubic feet, up 9.4% from the year-ago level of 2.361 tcf, data from the Energy Information Administration showed.Since the start of this week though, the weather has been colder, reaching 20 Fahrenheit (-6.7 Celsius) on Friday in New York City and some other key locations in the U.S. Northeast, which accounts for the largest heating market in the United States.Natural gas: Price Outlook“Gas has gone to extreme oversold conditions and its weekly Relative Strength Index is now at 28, matching the pattern of the 8 bearish weeks during its decline from a $10 peak to $4.75,” said Dixit of SKCharting.He said a short-term rebound from this week’s $2.35 low was a possibility, but this needs clear acceptance above $2.87 for an upside potential towards $3.30.“Sustainability below $2.87 will keep prices under pressure and trying to dig deeper.”Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold tumbled almost 3% on Friday after a blockbuster U.S. jobs report for January triggered profit-taking on the precious metal’s long-running rally, putting it way off the $2,000-an-ounce target eyed by bulls in the space.Gold for April delivery on New York’s Comex did a final trade of $1,877.70 on Friday, after settling at $1,868.30 an ounce, down $53.90, or 2.8%. It hit a four-week low of $1,874.55 during the session.It was the first time since Jan. 12 that gold’s $1,900 support on Comex had crumbled.The spot price of gold, more closely followed than futures by some traders, was at $1,864.93, down $47.64, or 2.49%.Gold’s plunge came as the Dollar Index and yields on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note surged after the U.S. Labor Department reported a non-farm payrolls growth for January that was almost three times above forecast, throwing a fresh challenge to the Federal Reserve’s hopes of seeing a cooling of the labor market and wages to get inflation to its target.Gold: Price Outlook Dixit noted that it took gold just two days to undo its 30-day climb from $1,860 to $1,960.“Going in to the week ahead, gold needs to hold defense at the 50-Day EMA of $1,854, failing which the metal runs the risk of a correction extending toward $1,842 and $1,828,” he said.Any recovery, meanwhile, faces challenges at $1,878-$1,885, followed by $1,900-$1,914. before retesting major resistance and supply zone at $1,929, Dixit said.Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesOil falls about 3% as strong U.S. jobs data prompt interest rate concernsNatural gas hits more than 2-year low, sinks 21% for week]"

Believe it or not, there’s a technology not too far off – and it already generates profits.It’s time to take a ride with OPAL Fuels Inc. (Nasdaq: OPAL), a newly-listed company that creates renewable natural gas (RNG) from decomposing organic material in landfills as well as dairies. While OPAL can’t fuel a DeLorean, it is able to replace fossil fuels like diesel for major customers such as Amazon and UPS who operate massive fleets of trucks making countless deliveries daily.A big reason why RNG is in high demand: positive environmental impact. Using an example of a 100-truck fleet driving 100,000 miles per year per truck, annual carbon emissions for a diesel fleet is 17,000 tons, versus just 153 tons for RNG from landfills and negative 7,098 tons for RNG from dairy, according to B. Riley.The beauty of RNG is that it’s chemically identical to compressed natural gas, so it may not require new vehicle purchases to make the switch. And the existing market is huge: natural gas powers more than 175,000 vehicles in the U.S. and roughly 23 million vehicles worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.Story continuesBut even if a fleet of, say, diesel trucks needs to be replaced at a higher upfront cost, very meaningful savings comes over time via cheaper fuel expenses. RNG also burns nearly twice as cleanly as the diesel it replaces in heavy-duty trucks, providing another opportunity to limit emissions.RNG has tremendous room for growth. Current production of about 400 million gas gallon equivalents per year is less than 1% of the U.S. heavy duty fuel market. Even if supply meets forecasts and triples to roughly 1 billion gas gallon equivalents in five years, it would still be less than 3% of the U.S. heavy duty fuel market.RNG is also easy to move around. It can be sent to many end markets using existing natural gas pipelines across the country. It can even be sent to Europe – or farther if needed – by ship.And while many companies in the electric vehicle industry have yet to deliver batteries, or various other components of the supply chain, OPAL has been selling fuel for over a decade. Current fueling-station customers include giants Waste Management and Amazon, who have an average contract length of 10 years.OPAL landed another big contract in December, when it said it signed a 10-year deal with UPS to provide operations and maintenance services at 51 fueling centers nationwide. Long-term deals with such behemoths – and a wide variety of them – should give investors assurance in OPAL’s predictable revenue over time.Such customers also find RNG to be a great choice over other next-generation options. Battery technology, for instance, is still years away from powering heavy, long-distance vehicles at any significant scale. The Department of Transportation has serious weight limits that would require big trucks to sacrifice valuable cargo space.And while the likes of Nikola tout hydrogen, it’s even further away from practical use and hydrogen fuel stations will take many years to build out. It can also be dangerous: hydrogen is known to cause fires or explosions if not handled properly.An important key to the OPAL story is vertical integration, meaning it captures RNG itself and delivers it all the way to vehicles at its own fueling stations. Having access to its own RNG should help OPAL keep winning market share over time because buyers can have faith in available supply.Vertical integration has even more benefits. OPAL can save on third-party costs, offer better terms to transportation customers, and likely attract partners seeking valuable government credits for reducing carbon emissions.OPAL itself benefits from a bevy of government incentives – though it could be profitable without the extra help. One important boost comes from renewable identification numbers (RINs), which are credits used as a currency in the EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard Program. It could also benefit from so-called eRINs, which may be generated from a project using a renewable fuel to power EVs. Provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act could offer even more benefits.OPAL sources RNG from two key sources: landfills and dairies. Landfills have also been used source electricity but far more energy – four times the amount – can be extracted going the RNG route.And while landfills are OPAL’s main focus, it also works with dairies, which generate massive amounts of methane, a problematic greenhouse gas. Indeed, methane is 60-70 times worse for the ozone layer than carbon dioxide.Turning to financials, the company looks rock solid – unlike many recent IPOs. It has virtually no net debt and liquidity of $329 million. There’s also $115 million in undrawn cash under a credit facility.That flexibility is important as the company continues to build out new plants. It currently has six RNG facilities in operation and seven more under development.The company is already very profitable, with an estimate of $60 million – $63 million in Ebitda for 2022. Analysts expect that to more-than quadruple to $264 million in 2025, according to Sentieo, an AI-enabled research platform.At $7.20 a share, OPAL trades at 4.7 times consensus 2025 Ebitda. Ameresco, Inc., meanwhile, commands a multiple of 11.9 times. B. Riley recently issued a $14 price target, reflecting an 8.5x EV/EBITDA multiple on the broker’s own 2025 estimate.At least some of that discount is beyond OPAL’s control as investors have shunned new IPOs across the board. But with profits, vertical integration and visibility over many years though the clean-energy transition, it shouldn’t be hard for savvy investors to see the glimmer in OPAL.Contact:IPO Edgewww.IPO-Edge.comEditor@IPO-Edge.com]"

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So when we looked at NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for NVIDIA, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.22 = US$7.3b ÷ (US$40b - US$6.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).So, NVIDIA has an ROCE of 22%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 15%. Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA roceIn the above chart we have measured NVIDIA's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering NVIDIA here  for free.So How Is NVIDIA's ROCE Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at NVIDIA, we didn't gain much confidence. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 33%. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.What We Can Learn From NVIDIA's ROCEEven though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for NVIDIA. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 267% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So should these growth trends continue, we'd be optimistic on the stock going forward.Story continuesIf you'd like to know about the risks facing NVIDIA, we've discovered 3 warning signs that you should be aware of.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:APD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 2, 2023Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Air Products' First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Sidd Manjeshwar. Please go ahead.Sidd Manjeshwar: Thank you, Katie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' first quarter 2023 earnings results teleconference. This is Sidd Manjeshwar, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; and Simon Moore, our Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations and Sustainability. As previously announced, he will be retiring at the end of March. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our Website at airproducts.com.This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide #2. In addition, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we specifically state otherwise, when we refer to earnings per share, operating income, operating margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE both on a total company and segment basis, we are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted return on capital employed. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our Website in the relevant earnings release section.Story continuesNow, I am pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Sidd, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very, very busy schedule to be on our call today. I am proud to say that the people at Air Products delivered great results this quarter despite the significant macroeconomic headwinds. I would like to thank each of our talented, dedicated and motivated employees for their hard work. Now please turn to Slide #3. Our safety performance, which is always our highest priority. As you can see, we have made significant progress since 2014. But we always work hard to do better. Our goal is to achieve zero incidents and zero accidents. Now please turn to Slide #4. For the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023, our earnings per share was $2.64, an improvement of 0.16 per share or 6% versus last year.But our underlying performance versus last year was much better than that. The items that you need to consider to make a fair comparison versus last year are a $0.15 negative impact from currency, and a one-time gain of $0.20 in the first quarter of last year from the finalization of the Jazan ASU joint venture. I would like to point out also that our guidance for the first quarter was to deliver earnings per share of 2.60 to 2.80. Our actual EPS is $2.64, which is within our guidance but at the lower end. The principal reason is that the Chinese and European economies were weaker than our expectation in early November, (512) forecast. Now, please turn to Slide #5. We are committed to recording our shareholders, while pursuing our long-term growth strategy.I am pleased to say that we have again raised our quarterly dividend this time by 8% to $1.75 per share per quarter, or $7 a share on an annual basis, extending our record of more than 14 consecutive years of dividend increase. We expect to pay out more than $1.5 billion to our shareholders in 2023, reflecting our commitment to return cash to our shareholders. Now, please go to Slide #6, which shows our EBITDA margin trend. While energy costs remain high, our margin improved this quarter. Our team has worked hard on increasing prices to offset the higher energy costs in our merchant business, and we continue to work on productivity. I would also like to point out that three quarters of the margin declined since the peak margin of around 42% is due to a higher energy cost pass-through in our upside business, which increases our sales but does not impact our profit.Now please turn to Slide #7. In addition to delivering strong results, we also achieved several significant project milestones during the quarter. In December 2022, we were very excited to announce our $4 billion green hydrogen project in the United States. This project will be located in Northern Texas, and is our latest mega-scale zero carbon, which means green hydrogen project since the announcement of our revolutionary NEOM green hydrogen project in 2020. And it will be by far the largest green hydrogen project in the United States. The information about this project and the recording of our December paid net cash is -- for this project are available on our website. Now please turn to Slide #8. We were pleased to announce in January 19, the completion of the second phase of the $12 million Jazan gasification and power project, which is 51% maturity owned by Air Products, and it is 60% project financed.During the first quarter, with the first phase of this project, which was completed in October of 2021, Air Products contributed around $0.5 billion for the purchase of $7.1 billion of assets from Saudi Aramco. In the second phase, which was just completed, Air Products contributed an additional $900 million for the purchase of $4.2 billion of additional assets. Our total cash contribution for this project is $2.5 billion. As expected, the first phase of the project at the end was $0.80 to $0.85 per share on an annual basis, which significantly contributed to our results in fiscal year 2022. With the completion of the second phase, we now expect about a total of $1.35 per share of earning contribution on an annual basis. This is fully in line the announced investors more than 3 years ago.Now please turn to Slide #9, to provide you an update on our great NEOM green hydrogen project, which is appropriate to give you an update, since we are very close to completing a major milestone, which is signing the definitive project financing agreements for this project. And therefore, we wanted to give you an update, before you read about that in the next few weeks. We have been making excellent progress on this large-scale project to bringing green energy to the world. The engineering is now about 30% complete. All major subcontracts for the project have been awarded including the power plant . Land preparation is completed and construction has started. And the joint venture team is in place and executing the project. Now, please turn to Slide #10.As you know, Air Products has a ownership position of the NEOM production joint ventures. But importantly, and this is very important. We remain the sole offtaker of 100% of the green hydrogen produced in the form of green ammonia produced at this facility and an exclusive 30-year contract. We continue to see significant opportunities to use this to bring green hydrogen to consumers around the world. And as I said we are the sole offtaker and distributor of this product. Then I want to emphasize that the offtake price for this green ammonia, it remains the same as when we negotiated the original project in the summer of 2020 when we announced the project. This is a very key point than the fact that now we are project financing this project, and as a result, we are absorbing all of the financing charges and so on that has not changed the offtake price.Then, now please turn to Slide #11. Initially the three partners which are Air Products, NEOM, which is owned by PIF; and ACWA Power, we intended to use our own cash to fund the project, the total project. Over the past 2 years, we've seen significant interest from the global financial institutions who see tremendous value proposition on this project. Therefore, we got tendered and reconsidered and we decided that the best course of action to minimize our cash contribution and maximize the return on the cash is to do non-recourse project financing of this project. The partners will contribute 25% cash and the remaining 75% will be non-recourse project financing. And obviously, if you are doing non-recourse project financing, you want to maximize the amount of money that you can borrow.Therefore, you put a lot of your ongoing cost and you bring it forward to the real present value and borrow against that. I would explain this a little bit more when we get to the detailed chart. This means that Air Products -- this project financing means that now our cash contribution to this project will be $800 million, less than $800 million, which is significantly less than the $1.7 billion that we originally expected. That is what you would expect us to do, that is the ballpark point of project finance. Now please turn to Slide #12. I'm pleased to say that the non-recourse financing is well underway and we are more than 2x over-subscribed from what we want to borrow. We have received commitments from over 20 global financial institutions, demonstrating their confidence in this project.Later this month, we expect to complete what we call the dry close, which is the signing of the definitive financing agreements, and we expect the full financial close to be completed a few months later. We will obviously let you know as we make progress on the project finance. Now please turn to Slide #13, so that I can provide you with an overview of the total project capital needs. First, the original $5 billion that we have mentioned before, for the capital required to build the facility. We have increased that -- it has increased by about $0.5 billion due to inflationary pressure that everybody expects. Then in addition, we have further increased the investment by $1.2 billion to include service from other people, but now we want to provide those services ourselves in order to make the project totally self-contained and we wouldn't be dependent on others.These include power transmission lines and other infrastructure that was needed for the project. This increases the capital cost, but it decreases the operating cost and we decided that was a better trade-off. But the key point was to make sure that the project is not dependent on other people doing that people have control over the whole thing so that we have everything that we need for the project to be operated. Now the other item that I'm sure will be a subject of questions from people is the $1.8 billion for project financing costs. That is a big number, but it is really explaining why that is. Again, as I said, if you have project financing, you want to put and borrow as much money as you can. First of all, about $1 billion of that $1.8 billion is the interest during construction.So we are spending money. We want to borrow that money. There is an interest to that borrowing. Therefore, that adds up for the of the project to about $1 billion. We want to finance that and borrow against them. Then we are using instead of leasing the land for 50 years, we decided to pay for the land upfront that reduces our ongoing cost, and we can finance that. That is a few hundred million dollars. Spares for the project. Usually you buy the spares as you go forward, we decided to buy all the sales upfront and finance it. So those are the kind of costs that comprise the $1.8 billion. It makes a lot of sense, and that is the beauty of finance that you can . You have the flexibility of bringing forward a lot of your costs that will save your operating costs in the future.Gas, Industry, FactoryPhoto by American Public Power Association on UnsplashSo all together, the total funding needed for the project is $8.5 billion. Now please turn to Slide 14, which is the overview of the funding. As I described before, the $8.5 billion is made up $6.2 billion of non-recourse debt, which we wanted to maximize and $2.3 billion of cash from the three partners. Therefore, obviously, the Air Products cash contributions , which is less than $800 billion and this is as compared to the $1.7 billion than we originally expected. So overall, we are very pleased with where we are. We are very pleased with the fact that our project financing , minimizing our cash flow, and we are very pleased that the prices that we are paying for the has stayed the same as it was in 2020. We are very optimistic about projects and the prospects for a good return for the total supply chain as we go forward.Now please turn to Slide 15. I would like to summarize the discussion by sharing some thoughts about our strategy. As I have mentioned before, there are two pillars for growth strategy of Air Products and sustainability is the foundation for both of them. Through our core industrial gas business, the supply customers in dozens of industries with critical products and services that lower emissions and increase efficiency and productivity. Through our Blue and Green hydrogen project of the future, we will commit more than $15 billion by 2027 to deliver clean hydrogen at a scale helping to drive the energy transition and moving . These two pillars, which support Air Products for success put us in the heart of needs for -- the Board's needs for sustainable energy and environmental solutions.I'm proud to say that the people of Air Products have continued to drive results in the near-term and make excellent progress in executing our growth project as we move forward. Slide #16 summarizes our management principles, which I reiterate every quarter. These principles are critical to Air Products' success and will continue to guide us in the future. Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Melissa, our Chief Financial Officer. Melissa?Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, Seifi. As Seifi mentioned earlier, we've delivered another set of incredible results in the quarter even with significant macroeconomic headwinds. Our commercial teams across the region continue to execute press actions and their efforts paid off. Price droves the 25% operating income improvement despite a significant negative currency impact, and operating margin was also 300 basis points higher compared to last year. I also would like to thank the team at Air Products for their continued outstanding efforts. Now please turn to Slide 17 for a review of our first quarter results. In comparison to last year, sales, volume and price were up nearly 10%. The 7% gain in price for the total company equaled a nearly 20% improvement in merchant price compared to last year, the fifth quarter in a row of double-digit increase.Volumes were up 2% higher, driven by better onsite in merchants, but partially offset by lower sales equipment activities. Volumes were strong in America and Asia, but weaker in Europe. Currency translation from the strengthening U.S. dollar reduced sales by about 6% and lower operating income at 8%. Despite this headwind, operating income jumped 25% and operating margin was 300 basis points higher, primarily driven by strong pricing. Operating income was higher across the region and particularly strong in America and Europe. Improvements in EBITDA and EBITDA margins were not as significant as operating income and operating margins due to the prior year one-time items primarily related to the Jazan ASU joint venture finalization. ROCE has climbed steadily over the last 6 quarters, reaching 11.3%, which is 120 basis points higher than last year.We expect ROCE to further improve as we bring new projects on stream and continue to put our cash on the balance sheet to work. Adjusting for cash, our ROCE would have been 13.3% this quarter. Sequentially, volume was weaker following a strong prior quarter, which also benefited from soft sales and a favorable contract . Price continues to gain strength across the region. Merchant price improved 3% versus last quarter. EBITDA was down 5%, primarily due to weaker volumes, while EBITDA margin was up 200 basis points as positive price cost pass-through more than offset the lower volume. Now please turn to Slide 18 for a discussion of our earnings per share results. Our first quarter adjusted EPS was $2.64 per share this year, up $0.60 or 6% compared to last year.Strong price drove the improved results. Price, net of variable costs contributed over $0.70 this quarter as our price actions more than offset the higher variable cost increases. Cost was $0.11 unfavorable primarily due to inflation and higher maintenance. Price, volume and cost together added $0.63 or a 25% increase compared to last year. However, the negative $0.15 from currency and a roughly $0.20 of prior year one-time benefit associated with the finalization of the Jazan ASU joint venture moderates a strong underlying results. The Jazan item accounted for much of the $0.14 decline in equity affiliates' income and an unfavorable $0.10 in non-controlling interest. The effective tax rate of 19.1% was 210 basis points unfavorable due to less tax benefit this year.We expect an effective tax rate of 19% to 20% in FY 2023. For the quarter, a non-service component of our defined benefit plans were favorable $0.04 last year and unfavorable $0.07 this year. As I shared with you last quarter, we now exclude the component from our adjusted results. Now please turn to Slide 19. Our distributable cash flow continued to climb, driven by improving EBITDA. While cash expenses included interest, cash tax and maintenance CapEx remains relatively stable over the last 3 years. Over the last 12 months, we generated close to $3.1 billion of distributable cash flow or almost $14 per share. From our distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% or over $1.4 billion as dividends to our shareholders while still had an almost $1.7 billion to invest for growth.Our ability to grow distributable cash flow, especially in challenging conditions, demonstrates the strength and stability of our business. It enabled us to continue to create shareholder value by increasing dividend and deploying capital for high return projects. Slide 20 provides an update of our capital deployment. As you can see, we have over $36 billion of capital deployment potential through fiscal 2027. The $36 billion includes over $8 billion of cash, additional debt capacity available today, about $17 billion, we expect to be available by 2027 and almost $12 billion already spent. We still believe this capacity is conservative given the potential for additional EBITDA growth, which would generate additional cash flow and additional borrowing capacity.As always, we continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted AA2 rating. So you can see our backlog of nearly $20 billion will provide a substantial amount of growth in the future. However, please note this figure still includes the second phase of Jazan project that was completed in January as well as the capital required for NEOM at its original higher value as we work through the finalization of project financing. Moreover, we will include the $4 billion Texas green hydrogen project when the project reaches final investment decision. We have already spent over 30% and committed 74% of the updated capacity we show on this slide. We have made great progress and still have substantial investment capacity remaining to invest in high return projects.We believe that investing in these high return projects is the best way to create shareholder value for the long run. We continue to evaluate our capital deployment options and determine the best way to use available cash and trusted to us by our shareholders. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Melissa. Now please turn to Slide #21 for our Asia first quarter results. Our businesses were able to deliver positive volume and price despite the negative COVID impact in certain parts of China. Volume improved7% supported by new assets. This quarter, we benefited from more than 25 new small to mid-sized traditional industrial gas plants which came on stream across the region over the last years. Price was up 1% in total, which is 3% -- which translates to 3% in our merchant business. Although underlying sales grew 8% versus last year and energy pass-through was a positive 2%, overall offset by a 10% weaker currency, which is obviously translation. Negative currency also reduced operating income and EBITDA each by about 10%.Operating income and EBITDA both improved versus prior year as better volume and price more than offset the negative COVID impact. Higher price and volume also drove margin improvement. Although China's government has relaxed its rules related to COVID, the subsequent high infection rates have impacted business activity. We expect economic recovery in China to take time. We anticipate power across the region to continue to rise, and we are taking action, which I mean pricing action, to mitigate the impact. Sequentially results compared unfavorably to last quarter, which benefited from some specific spot sales. At this point, I would like to turn the call over to Sidd to discuss our European results.

But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) shareholders have seen the share price rise 59% over three years, well in excess of the market return (23%, not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 15% in the last year , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Cummins While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the three years of share price growth, Cummins actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) drop 5.6% per year.Thus, it seems unlikely that the market is focussed on EPS growth at the moment. Given this situation, it makes sense to look at other metrics too.It could be that the revenue growth of 4.7% per year is viewed as evidence that Cummins is growing. If the company is being managed for the long term good, today's shareholders might be right to hold on.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Cummins, it has a TSR of 72% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Cummins shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 15% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 12%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

75,278646af-1bd1-305c-8d64-67cbe9e58410,DIS,2023-02-05,"With 64% ownership of the shares, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/64-ownership-shares-walt-disney-130014665.html,1675602014,STORY,['DIS'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 64% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Walt Disney. Check out our latest analysis for Walt Disney ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Walt Disney?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Walt Disney. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Walt Disney, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Walt Disney is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 7.9% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.3% and 3.8% of the stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Walt DisneyThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Walt Disney Company in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$53m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 36% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Walt Disney. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

If you want to see more most famous companies in the world, go directly to 5 Most Famous Companies in the World.In terms of branding, being very famous has its advantages in business.If a brand is well known, companies don't have to advertise as much as companies with brands that aren't as well known, all else equal.If a brand is well known and also well liked, companies could potentially sell more products at potentially higher prices. By selling more products at higher prices, companies can potentially realize higher margins and more profits, all else equal. With more profits, a company would have more resources to invest in growing faster.When a company has a leading brand, it can potentially launch new products easier as well. Because consumers are already familiar with one product of a brand, they might be more willing to try another product of the same brand, even though it might be a new product.Although there are great advantages to having a famous brand, branding building can be difficult. For the leading companies with famous brands, it can take years or even decades to build a brand.As a result, the world's most famous brands don't change very much from year to year.Leading BrandsSome of the world's most profitable companies are companies with leading brands such as Apple or Microsoft. Many of the companies with leading brands are consumer companies that sell products and services to consumers. Many are based in the United States, China, or Europe as those three economic blocs have the three largest economies, respectively.By having a strong brand, companies have a competitive advantage over companies that don't have as strong of a brand. Branding is just one aspect of a business, however, and the success and the growth of a business depends on many different things. Nevertheless having a famous brand helps.MethodologyFor our list of 25 Most Famous Companies in the World, we used Brand Finance's Global 500 2022 Ranking List that measures brand value in 2022 of different companies.Story continuesGiven fame is something that's hard to rank, we used the brand value of a company as an indicator, even though isn't exactly precise.The following list is the name of companies as many people know them. The brand name is the same as the name of the company as people know them. Companies can have commonly known names such as Microsoft, and official names such as Microsoft Corporation or Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). It is up for the reader to do more research on the official names.25 Most Famous Companies in the World25.

As a result, income investors can try to identify high-dividend stocks.Nevertheless, investors should perform their due diligence to ensure that the dividends of these stocks have a meaningful margin of safety. We will discuss the prospects of three high-yield stocks that look attractive for income investors right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOneok (OKE)a gas pipe with the sun going down in the background, naturalSource: ShutterstockOneok (NYSE:OKE) engages in the gathering and processing of natural gas. It provides services in the business of natural gas liquids (NGLs) and owns natural gas pipelines, both interstate and intrastate.The company has a 40,000-mile network of NGLs and natural gas pipelines and provides midstream services to producers, processors and customers. Its assets are ideally positioned in the major shale basins, Permian and Bakken. More than 10% of the total U.S. natural gas production is transferred through the network of Oneok.Most energy stocks are highly cyclical due to the boom-and-bust cycles of the oil and gas industry. Oneok has exhibited a volatile performance record. However, it has greatly improved its performance in the last five years. This is thanks to the completion of a series of growth projects, such as pipelines and fractionation services in the Permian Basin and the material contribution of these projects to the cash flows of the company.It is also worth noting that a significant portion of the cash flows of Oneok are fee-based or hedged. This means that Oneok is more defensive during downturns than most energy companies. This resilience was evident during the downturn caused by the collapse of oil and gas prices between mid-2014 and 2016. Despite the collapse of commodity prices, the company kept raising its dividend throughout that downturn.Due to the effect of the coronavirus crisis on its business, the company paid the same dividend for 12 consecutive quarters, from the first quarter of 2020 until the fourth quarter of 2022. It broke its dividend growth streak but defended its dividend. This stands in contrast to many other energy companies, which cut their dividend due to the pandemic.Story continuesOneok has raised its dividend by 2% this year and is currently offering a 5.5% forward dividend yield. The payout ratio of the company spiked to 88% in 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic on its cash flows. However, the payout ratio has reverted to 68%, as Oneok is expected to report all-time-high distributable cash flow per share for 2022 thanks to the favorable commodity prices and the recovery of U.S. gas production.Newell Brands (NWL)A photo of a sign showing the Newell Brands (NWL) logo outside a building.Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comNewell Brands (NASDAQ:NWL) traces its roots back to 1903 when Edgar Newell purchased a struggling curtain rod manufacturer. Since then, Newell Brands has transformed itself into a consumer brands powerhouse with large acquisitions. Some examples include its merger with Jarden as well as its acquisition of Sistema. The primary competitive advantage of Newell is its position in several niche markets. These markets are small but necessary, and hence profitable.Newell Brands is currently facing an exceptionally adverse business landscape. Due to the surge of inflation to a nearly 40-year high, its costs have greatly increased. Therefore, its operating margins have shrunk considerably. Excessive inflation has also reduced the real purchasing power of consumers, and thus the company experiences lower demand for its products.In addition, many of the customers of Newell Brands are in the process of reducing their inventories to preserve funds.  Furthermore, the sales and earnings of the company are hurt by a strong dollar. Due to all these headwinds, Newell Brands has guided for earnings per share (EPS) of $1.56-$1.61 in 2022. At the mid-point, this guidance implies a 13% decrease over the prior year.Newell Brands has divested many non-core assets in recent years, meaning its revenues and EPS have stagnated in the last four years. On the bright side, the company has nearly completed its asset divestments, and management set a goal to achieve operating margins over 15%, though patience will probably be required on this front.It is also worth noting that Newell Brands has paid the same dividend for five consecutive years. Given the aforementioned headwinds and the recent increase of the leverage ratio (net debt to EBITDA) from 3.1 to 3.9, investors should not expect a dividend raise anytime soon. On the other hand, thanks to a reasonable payout ratio of 58%, the dividend has a wide margin of safety. As a result, the nearly 10-year-high dividend yield of 5.8% of Newell Brands is safe for the foreseeable future.Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (CBRL)Cracker Barrel Old Country Store sign on the outside of one of its locationsSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comCracker Barrel Old Country Store (NASDAQ:CBRL) was founded in 1969 as a restaurant concept that embraces America’s heritage. It sells homestyle food at modest prices and differentiates itself from competitors within the casual dining industry thanks to its unique menu offerings. For instance, some of Cracker Barrel’s most popular menu items are its meatloaf and signature biscuits. The company also operates a gift shop.The restaurant industry is highly competitive with low barriers to entry. However, Cracker Barrel has a strong brand thanks to its differentiated menu and popularity within its niche category. In addition, Cracker Barrel has proved fairly resilient to recessions thanks to its affordable menu offerings. During rough economic periods, consumers tend to shift from high-priced restaurants to value-oriented restaurants. This helps explain the resilient performance of Cracker Barrel during the Great Recession.On the other hand, due to the unprecedented lockdowns imposed during the pandemic, Cracker Barrel was severely hurt. To be sure, the company incurred a 77% plunge in its EPS, from $9.03 in 2019 to $2.04 in 2020. Even worse, while most restaurant chains have recovered from the pandemic, Cracker Barrel is still far from achieving its pre-pandemic earnings. In fiscal 2022, Cracker Barrel grew its EPS 18%. But its bottom line is still 33% lower than its pre-pandemic level.Cracker Barrel is also facing another secular headwind: the decline of U.S. malls and the emergence of other eating options, such as meal kits. These developments have hurt sit-down restaurants. Nevertheless, as Cracker Barrel is still far from its pre-pandemic performance, the company has ample room to grow its EPS in the upcoming years.Moreover, Cracker Barrel is offering an exceptionally high dividend yield of 4.7%. Its payout ratio is high at 89%. However, it is unlikely to cut its dividend thanks to its strong balance sheet and the expected recovery of its business.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:URI) shareholders after stock gained 4.8%, they should consider it with a grain of salt. In spite of the relatively cheap prices, insiders made the decision to sell US$8.3m worth of stock in the last 12 months. This could be a warning indicator of vulnerabilities in the future.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for United Rentals The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At United RentalsNotably, that recent sale by Dale Asplund is the biggest insider sale of United Rentals shares that we've seen in the last year. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$455. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was 52% of Dale Asplund's stake.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 349.99 shares worth US$111k. On the other hand they divested 20.79k shares, for US$8.3m. All up, insiders sold more shares in United Rentals than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.United Rentals Insiders Are Selling The StockThere was substantially more insider selling, than buying, of United Rentals shares over the last three months. In that time, insiders dumped US$6.1m worth of shares. On the other hand we note Independent Director Jose Alvarez bought US$61k worth of shares. Since the selling really does outweigh the buying, we'd say that these transactions may suggest that some insiders feel the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes United Rentals Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that United Rentals insiders own 0.4% of the company, worth about US$136m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The United Rentals Insider Transactions Indicate?The insider sales have outweighed the insider buying, at United Rentals, in the last three months. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. But it is good to see that United Rentals is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. For example - United Rentals has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.But note: United Rentals may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The increasingly worsening economic conditions ahead might lead to companies forecasting weaker results in the quarters ahead.Investors need to protect their portfolios by finding the tech stocks to sell from companies that have poor business fundamentals. This includes companies that do not make a profit or face a sharp drop in sales. Readers need to watch out for companies led by executives who do not offer a business plan to navigate the tough market conditions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIBMIBM$133.41LOGILogitech International$57.94MRVLMarvell $44.02MUMicron Technology$61.45PLTRPalantir Technologies$7.82RDFNRedfin$7.69WOLFWolfspeed$80.48IBM (IBM)Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comIBM (NYSE:IBM) touted its solid fourth-quarter performance by citing its hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence solutions. It claims that those offerings differentiated its technology from the competition, but it still is among the tech stocks to sell now.On the surface, the revenue growth looks healthy. However, it rose because IBM keeps acquiring new businesses. Growth by acquisitions is not a sustainable business model when business conditions risk worsening. The potential for a recession will pressure IBM to cut costs further.The company will cut 1.5% of its workforce or 3,900 jobs. To achieve a calendar 2023 cash flow of $10.5 billion, IBM may need to reduce its headcount even more. It realized free cash growth from favorable cash tax payments and lower payments for structural actions. However, it spent $2.3 billion to buy eight companies across the software and consulting sectors.Shareholders might lose patience waiting for IBM to achieve higher working capital efficiency. Recurring revenue from software may slow as corporate customers find ways to cut their costs.Story continuesLogitech International (LOGI)Two receivers for wireless Logitech (LOGI) devices, plugged into a laptop computer.Source: Somphop Krittayaworagul / Shutterstock.comLogitech International (NASDAQ:LOGI) thrived during the 2020-21 pandemic. When the lockdown ended, computer gamers did not need to buy mouse and keyboard peripherals.The company posted revenue slumping by 22.1% to $1.27 billion in its fiscal third quarter. During the all-important holiday season, Logitech’s introduction of new products did not perform well.Logitech has 20 new products announced or launched. CEO Bracken Darrell said that G Cloud is a narrow launch, available only in the U.S. first. It will release the platform in Europe and Japan next. Shareholders are taking a risk holding the stock as margin pressures rise.Inventories stood at $104.5 million. Despite the CEO pointing out the sequential decline, Logitech might need aggressive promotions to sell the excess inventory. This would weaken its operating margins.Logitech’s discount promotions may not increase sales. Customers may easily find inexpensive substitutes for computer peripherals. Trading at a premium P/E of 22.7 times, this is one of the no-brainer tech stocks to sell.Marvell Tech (MRVL)image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campusSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comMarvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a semiconductor company. Vice-President of Investor Relations Ashish Saran said that it will take a few quarters to return to the $800 million in annualized revenue from the storage division.The need for storage changed during this product cycle. Previously, personal computer owners needed to switch from hard disks to solid-state drives. This time, cloud customers and data center operations will buy more SSD units later this year. Before that happens, the industry needs to work through the excess inventory.Marvell has next-generation PCI Generation 5 and Generation 6 rolling out in the next few years. However, investors may consider Marvell as a stock to sell from here. They do not want to invest in short-term uncertainty while waiting for the product launch.Micron Technology (MU)An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock.Source: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.comMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a memory chip supplier. In its last quarterly report, it posted revenue falling by almost $2 billion, down by 46.8% Y/Y. In the next quarter, the company expects to lose 62 cents a share.Micron has plenty of cash that it will use to buy back shares. This will minimize the downside for MU stock but is not enough to stop investors from selling their shares. The company will slow its cash outflow by sending less on capital expenditure. It will delay wafer starts. This will reduce the oversupply of chips on the market.Tech investors are wary of betting on companies that are not growing. This is a stock to sell while Micron manages the excess inventory, which it expects to peak in the current quarter. It may slash prices, which pressures operating margins.Consider avoiding or selling MU stock until supply and demand reach an equilibrium in the mid-year.Palantir Technologies (PLTR)Palantir (PLTR) logo in a smartphone with a series of stock charts on the background.Source: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.comPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) posted revenue growth of 22% Y/Y in the third quarter. Customer count grew by 66% Y/Y, which looks impressive at first. Losses mounted on a GAAP basis, compared to a one-cent profit non-GAAP.Palantir lost $123.87 million in the last quarter. When the tech sector traded at frothy levels three years ago, markets could forgive Palantir paying for growth. Today, tech investors are less willing to speculate on companies that lose money as revenue grows. This is not a sustainable business model. The firm may need to sell shares or issue debt to cover the losses.Palantir needs to prove its software offering is unmatched by the competition. Until it announces contract deals with sizable dollar amounts, PLTR stock is pure speculation.Redfin (RDFN)Redfin sign posted in front of a house for sale; Redfin (RDFN) is a real estate brokerage whose business model is based on sellers paying Redfin a small feeSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comRedfin (NASDAQ:RDFN) is a software real estate company. In the third quarter, it posted a GAAP EPS loss of 83 cents. Shareholders will not catch a break from the loss. In the fourth quarter, Redfin expects to report an EBITDA loss of between $58 million and $71 million.To reduce expenses, Redfin wound down RedfinNow, a home-flipping service. This includes a workforce reduction of 13% of staff. The housing market has major headwinds after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates throughout 2022. Home buyers have hope. Mortgage rates fell to their lowest point in four months.Real estate transactions might stabilize with better mortgage rates. Yet Redfin has to invest heavily in digital revenue streams. Gross margins per visit will not increase enough if real estate rebounds only slightly. In the near-term, cost cuts related to its headquarters and operations will not help the stock rebound.Wolfspeed (WOLF)WOLF stock: Person holding smartphone with logo of US semiconductor company Wolfspeed Inc. on screen in front of website.

It expects to lose $81 million to $88 million in the third quarter.Wolfspeed expects a weakening business momentum. It used to forecast strong revenue expectations from its materials business. Chief Financial Officer Reynolds said that the company benefits from strong demand in the power devices and materials sector. This is offset by radio frequency markets weakening in the last quarter. Customers are pushing back orders.Yields from 150 nanometers fell. Wolfspeed resolved those issues, only to face longer cycle times and higher inventory. Shipping rates also slowed, hurting revenue recognition. Equipment spare parts shortages limited output at its Durham fab.Wolfspeed is a tech stock to sell. The stock trades at a forward P/E of over 100 times. Shares are overpriced at these levels. They are at risk of falling as investors seek to avoid risks.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

A supply glut coupled with slowing sales of personal computers, smartphones and other devices conspired to drag the stocks of nearly all semiconductor and microchip companies lower. Even leading semiconductor companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) were not spared from the carnage. The PHLX Semiconductor Sector index (NASDAQ:SOX), which is comprised of 30 top semiconductor companies, is down 19% from a year ago. And that’s after posting a 15% gain in January of this year. While the semiconductor industry is starting to show signs of a recovery, there is still a long way to go to get back to the levels seen during the height of the global pandemic. And the recovery so far has not been even. Here are seven sorry semiconductor stocks to sell in February before it’s too late.INTCIntel$30WDCWestern Digital$44MUMicron$62.60MRVLMarvell$48.20QCOMQualcomm$135NXPINXP Semiconductors$194AMATApplied Materials$123Semiconductor Stocks to Sell: Intel (INTC)The Intel logo in blue on a black screen.Source: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.comWe’ll start with the worst semiconductor company right now, and that would be Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The Santa Clara, California-based company has been in the news a lot lately following horrendous earnings that caused the stock to dive 10% and led to job cuts and executive pay being slashed.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIntel reported that it earned 10 cents for the fourth and final quarter of 2022, which was half the 20 cents expected, on average, by analysts on Wall Street. Intel’s Q4 revenue fell 32% year-over-year to $14.04 billion compared to the mean estimate of $14.45 billion that was anticipated,. The company recorded a  Q4 net loss of $664 million, compared with a profit of $4.62 billion  during the same quarter a year earlier. The firm’s forward guidance was equally bad.Intel blamed the ugly results on declining sales of personal computers and conceded that it is losing market share to rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). In the days since the results, Intel has responded with more job cuts and plans to cut executive pay, including a 25% cut to the salary of CEO Pat Gelsinger.Story continuesBut investors don’t appear to be having any of it. INTC stock is now down 42% from a year ago and trading at $28 a share.Western Digital (WDC)Front of a Western Digital (WDC) building in Malpitas, California.Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comWestern Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), which makes memory chips along with data storage devices, is another company whose stock is getting hammered following its latest earnings print. Western Digital reported a loss of 42 cents a share on revenue of $3.11 billion. Analysts who cover the company were calling for, on average, a loss of 15 cents on revenue of $2.99 billion, according to Refinitiv. WDC stock fell 6% immediately after the results were made public.The San Jose, California-based company said that the market for its memory chips is going through one of its worst downturns ever. The earnings miss comes as rumors intensify that Western Digital is considering a potential merger with Japan’s Kioxia Holdings. A combination of Western Digital and privately held Kioxia  would control a third of the market for flash memory and enable the new entity to compete against global leader Samsung Electronics.Rumors of the Kioxia merger come as Western Digital tries to appease activist investor Elliott Management, which targeted the company last year. Over the past 12 months, WDC stock has declined nearly 20% to $42 a share.Micron Technology (MU)Micron (MU) logo on a mobile phone that's on a tableSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comBoise, Idaho-based Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a legacy tech company that has been a going concern since 1978. Its best days were during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s. In many ways, the company and its long suffering shareholders have never recovered from the dotcom bubble bursting in the early 2000s. Today, MU stock trades at $60 a share, down 25% in the last 12 months alone. The stock’s all-time peak came in early 2000 when it was trading at just over $100.As with Western Digital, Micron is screaming that the bottom has fallen out of the memory chip market, causing a disaster for its finances. Micron’s revenue plunged 47% year-over-year in its fiscal first quarter ended December 1, 2022. Guidance for the current quarter was a horror show, with Micron saying it expects to produce $3.8 billion in revenue in the fiscal second quarter, down 51% year-over-year, and report a net loss of 62 cents a share.Like a lot of semiconductor companies that have lost market share, Micron is trying to spend its way out of trouble. Specifically, the company has announced plans to allocate $15 billion to build a new memory chip plant in Boise that it says will create 17,000 jobs. While encouraging, the memory chip plant isn’t scheduled to be completed until the end of this decade, at the earliest. Meanwhile, the company continues to talk publicly about the need for more government subsidies to help it compete in a global market.Marvell Technology (MRVL)image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campusSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comThe shares of Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) have struggled mightily over the last year. Since February 2022, MRVL stock has declined nearly 40% to $45 a share. The company, which makes semiconductors for data storage, communications and consumer markets, has been hurt coming out of the pandemic by supply chain constraints and weakening demand for its products. Marvell Technology most recently announced a new CFO, Willem Meintjes, as it tries to get its fiscal house in order.In terms of earnings, Marvell most recently reported earnings per share of 2 cents. While that was up from a net loss a year earlier, it still missed analysts’ average  expectations by more than 2%. The company is hoping to turn things around this year as inflation and interest rates moderate and the supply chain problems that vexed it over the last year resolve themselves.While some analysts remain bullish on the stock, investors should wait for the company to embark on  a real, substantial turnaround before investing in MRVL stock.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on a large sign with another sign that says 5GSource: Xixi Fu / Shutterstock.comSan Diego-based Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) makes semiconductors that enable  smartphones and other devices to exploit 5G. While that sounds like a good business to be om right now, Qualcomm’s business and stock are suffering. Growing fears of an economic recession have led many businesses and consumers to hit pause on upgrading to 5G wireless. At the same time, Qualcomm faces intense competition from the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:APPL) and Samsung.As a result, QCOM stock is down 26% over the past year. Qualcomm has quarterly earnings on deck, but many analysts are forecasting a rough road ahead for the company following lackluster results from other semiconductor companies such as Micron and Marvell.Qualcomm is also being hurt by a decline of smartphone sales, which fell nearly 10% in 2022, according to market research firm IDC. At the midpoint of its guidance range, the company is calling for its revenue to fall 10% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier.NXP Semiconductor (NXPI)A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor. NXPI stock.Source: Lukassek / Shutterstock.comDutch company NXP Semiconductor (NASDAQ:NXPI) makes microchips and semiconductors for the automotive, industrial and internet of things (IoT) markets. There was some buzz around NXP Semiconductor a few years ago when the aforementioned Qualcomm tried to buy the company. However, Chinese authorities squashed the proposed acquisition and NXP Semiconductor has been largely drifting ever since. In the past year, NXPI stock has dropped 8%. There are currently rumors that Samsung is considering buying NXP Semiconductor, though no deal has been announced.More recently, NXP Semiconductor has gotten caught up in President Biden’s efforts to limit semiconductor sales and chipmaker activities in China due to security concerns. President Biden has rallied international support for limiting the flow of advanced technologies to China, including from the government of the Netherlands where NXP is based.The move to curtail technology flows and activities in China is bad news for NXP Semiconductor, which until now had a strong presence in the world’s second-largest economy.Semiconductor Stocks to Sell: Applied Materials (AMAT)Applied Materials company sign outside officeSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.comSanta Clara-California-based Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a little different than the other companies on this list because it supplies the equipment and software needed to manufacture semiconductors. And its business is only as strong as the semiconductor and microchip market. As that market has slumped over the past year, AMAT stock has declined 15%. The company has been around since 1967 and survived many previous market cycles.Applied Materials is still waiting for the supply chain snarls that impacted the semiconductor space to ease this year and for orders from leading customers such as Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) to pick up.At the same time, Applied Materials is being hurt by President Biden’s efforts to curtail technology shipments and activity in China. Applied Materials said that China accounted for 28% of its 2022 revenue, and that the new U.S. rules could cost it $2.5 billion in lost revenue this year.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and AAPL.

As a result, income investors can try to identify high-dividend stocks.Nevertheless, investors should perform their due diligence to ensure that the dividends of these stocks have a meaningful margin of safety. We will discuss the prospects of three high-yield stocks that look attractive for income investors right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOneok (OKE)a gas pipe with the sun going down in the background, naturalSource: ShutterstockOneok (NYSE:OKE) engages in the gathering and processing of natural gas. It provides services in the business of natural gas liquids (NGLs) and owns natural gas pipelines, both interstate and intrastate.The company has a 40,000-mile network of NGLs and natural gas pipelines and provides midstream services to producers, processors and customers. Its assets are ideally positioned in the major shale basins, Permian and Bakken. More than 10% of the total U.S. natural gas production is transferred through the network of Oneok.Most energy stocks are highly cyclical due to the boom-and-bust cycles of the oil and gas industry. Oneok has exhibited a volatile performance record. However, it has greatly improved its performance in the last five years. This is thanks to the completion of a series of growth projects, such as pipelines and fractionation services in the Permian Basin and the material contribution of these projects to the cash flows of the company.It is also worth noting that a significant portion of the cash flows of Oneok are fee-based or hedged. This means that Oneok is more defensive during downturns than most energy companies. This resilience was evident during the downturn caused by the collapse of oil and gas prices between mid-2014 and 2016. Despite the collapse of commodity prices, the company kept raising its dividend throughout that downturn.Due to the effect of the coronavirus crisis on its business, the company paid the same dividend for 12 consecutive quarters, from the first quarter of 2020 until the fourth quarter of 2022. It broke its dividend growth streak but defended its dividend. This stands in contrast to many other energy companies, which cut their dividend due to the pandemic.Story continuesOneok has raised its dividend by 2% this year and is currently offering a 5.5% forward dividend yield. The payout ratio of the company spiked to 88% in 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic on its cash flows. However, the payout ratio has reverted to 68%, as Oneok is expected to report all-time-high distributable cash flow per share for 2022 thanks to the favorable commodity prices and the recovery of U.S. gas production.Newell Brands (NWL)A photo of a sign showing the Newell Brands (NWL) logo outside a building.Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comNewell Brands (NASDAQ:NWL) traces its roots back to 1903 when Edgar Newell purchased a struggling curtain rod manufacturer. Since then, Newell Brands has transformed itself into a consumer brands powerhouse with large acquisitions. Some examples include its merger with Jarden as well as its acquisition of Sistema. The primary competitive advantage of Newell is its position in several niche markets. These markets are small but necessary, and hence profitable.Newell Brands is currently facing an exceptionally adverse business landscape. Due to the surge of inflation to a nearly 40-year high, its costs have greatly increased. Therefore, its operating margins have shrunk considerably. Excessive inflation has also reduced the real purchasing power of consumers, and thus the company experiences lower demand for its products.In addition, many of the customers of Newell Brands are in the process of reducing their inventories to preserve funds.  Furthermore, the sales and earnings of the company are hurt by a strong dollar. Due to all these headwinds, Newell Brands has guided for earnings per share (EPS) of $1.56-$1.61 in 2022. At the mid-point, this guidance implies a 13% decrease over the prior year.Newell Brands has divested many non-core assets in recent years, meaning its revenues and EPS have stagnated in the last four years. On the bright side, the company has nearly completed its asset divestments, and management set a goal to achieve operating margins over 15%, though patience will probably be required on this front.It is also worth noting that Newell Brands has paid the same dividend for five consecutive years. Given the aforementioned headwinds and the recent increase of the leverage ratio (net debt to EBITDA) from 3.1 to 3.9, investors should not expect a dividend raise anytime soon. On the other hand, thanks to a reasonable payout ratio of 58%, the dividend has a wide margin of safety. As a result, the nearly 10-year-high dividend yield of 5.8% of Newell Brands is safe for the foreseeable future.Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (CBRL)Cracker Barrel Old Country Store sign on the outside of one of its locationsSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comCracker Barrel Old Country Store (NASDAQ:CBRL) was founded in 1969 as a restaurant concept that embraces America’s heritage. It sells homestyle food at modest prices and differentiates itself from competitors within the casual dining industry thanks to its unique menu offerings. For instance, some of Cracker Barrel’s most popular menu items are its meatloaf and signature biscuits. The company also operates a gift shop.The restaurant industry is highly competitive with low barriers to entry. However, Cracker Barrel has a strong brand thanks to its differentiated menu and popularity within its niche category. In addition, Cracker Barrel has proved fairly resilient to recessions thanks to its affordable menu offerings. During rough economic periods, consumers tend to shift from high-priced restaurants to value-oriented restaurants. This helps explain the resilient performance of Cracker Barrel during the Great Recession.On the other hand, due to the unprecedented lockdowns imposed during the pandemic, Cracker Barrel was severely hurt. To be sure, the company incurred a 77% plunge in its EPS, from $9.03 in 2019 to $2.04 in 2020. Even worse, while most restaurant chains have recovered from the pandemic, Cracker Barrel is still far from achieving its pre-pandemic earnings. In fiscal 2022, Cracker Barrel grew its EPS 18%. But its bottom line is still 33% lower than its pre-pandemic level.Cracker Barrel is also facing another secular headwind: the decline of U.S. malls and the emergence of other eating options, such as meal kits. These developments have hurt sit-down restaurants. Nevertheless, as Cracker Barrel is still far from its pre-pandemic performance, the company has ample room to grow its EPS in the upcoming years.Moreover, Cracker Barrel is offering an exceptionally high dividend yield of 4.7%. Its payout ratio is high at 89%. However, it is unlikely to cut its dividend thanks to its strong balance sheet and the expected recovery of its business.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This makes the dividend yield 2.0%, which is above the industry average. View our latest analysis for Quest Diagnostics Quest Diagnostics' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. However, prior to this announcement, Quest Diagnostics' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 13.3% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 31%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendQuest Diagnostics Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.68, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.84. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 15% a year over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.We Could See Quest Diagnostics' Dividend GrowingInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Quest Diagnostics has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 8.1% per annum. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Quest Diagnostics' prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.Quest Diagnostics Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 2 warning signs for Quest Diagnostics that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

96,25952597-d426-372c-b5a7-03dfec34209e,CSCO,2023-02-05,"With 74% ownership of the shares, Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/74-ownership-shares-cisco-systems-140011459.html,1675519211,STORY,['CSCO'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 74% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Cisco Systems. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cisco Systems?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Cisco Systems already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Cisco Systems' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Cisco Systems. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.4% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.4% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Cisco SystemsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Cisco Systems, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$54m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 26% stake in Cisco Systems. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.
