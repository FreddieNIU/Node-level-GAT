You should consider the Schwab 1000 Index ETF (SCHK), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 10/11/2017.The fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $2.09 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendCompanies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Blend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.05%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.67%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 26.40% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 6.57% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon Com Inc (AMZN).The top 10 holdings account for about 25.33% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHK seeks to match the performance of the Schwab 1000 Index before fees and expenses. The Schwab 1000 Index is a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that includes the 1,000 largest stocks of publicly traded companies in the United States, with size being determined by market capitalization. The index is designed to be a measure of the performance of large- and mid-cap U.S. stocks.Story continuesThe ETF has lost about -25.13% so far this year and is down about -19.94% in the last one year (as of 10/17/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $34.56 and $46.85.The ETF has a beta of 1.02 and standard deviation of 24.57% for the trailing three-year period. With about 989 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab 1000 Index ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SCHK is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF has $270.02 billion in assets, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF has $327.85 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.Bottom-LineWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2,72f14eb4-a335-3aba-a7b2-aef5f8e20392,TXN,2022-10-17,7 Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-nasdaq-stocks-buy-hold-202653207.html,1665694853,STORY,"['NDAQ', 'TXN', 'GOOGL', 'PEP', 'BRKR', 'SBUX']","[The Nasdaq is known for high-flying growth stocks, not necessarily buy-and-hold candidates. Electric vehicles, biotechnology, social networking stocks, cloud software companies and the like. These are the sort of companies that can go up five- or 10-fold if their businesses find sustained market success. On the other hand, their stocks can easily end up losing most of their value if anything goes wrong and/or there is a broader correction in the tech sector.Over the past year, the Nasdaq is down 33.5%, with many of the individual components suffering far greater losses as investors refocused their attention from future growth to current profits and cash flows. It feels as though investors are hyper-focused on short-term losses rather than long-term potential, such as where a company may be in, say, 2030.On the bright side, this year’s bear market has created some stellar opportunities for long-term investors looking for Nasdaq stocks to buy and hold. Below are seven of them.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTXNTexas Instruments$168.11JDJD.com$45.49IBKRInteractive Brokers$80.10PEPPepsiCo$180.71CEGConstellation Energy$87.54CSXCSX Corporation$29.98IDXXIDEXX Laboratories$382.90Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold: Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is an analog semiconductor company. Analog semiconductors are vital because they turn real-world information such as weather conditions into data. The ability to sense and process external information is crucial for enabling cutting-edge technologies such as autonomous driving, remote monitoring and internet of things applications.Semiconductor shortages in 2021 led to high prices and record profits across the industry. The boom has turned into a bust this year, however, as demand for consumer electronics such as televisions and laptops has dropped significantly from peak 2021 levels. Texas Instruments has been able to sidestep much of this cyclical pain, though, since its analog chips tend to go into slower-moving industrial markets rather than hot consumer products.Story continuesTexas Instruments is also a cash flow machine. Management is laser-focused on the metric, noting in a recent presentation: “We believe that growth of free cash flow per share is the primary driver of long-term value.”This focus has worked out well for shareholders. Over the past 10 years, TXN stock has averaged a 20.6% return and it offers a 3.1% dividend yield.JD.com (JD)JD.com (JD) logo displayed at the entrance to the company's Silicon Valley office.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comChinese tech stocks have been an abject failure over the past year. Investors have lost a ton of money in the sector, and many traders have understandably thrown in the towel. Obviously, Chinese securities carry elevated political and financial risks right now.That said, China still has more than a billion people and most of them are going to shop online. JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is one of the country’s most promising e-commerce services. It has built a reputation for higher product quality standards than its rivals, which has been a big selling point in a market that has a problem with knock-off and counterfeit goods. In addition, JD has invested heavily in logistics, which has powered fast and reliable delivery schedules.JD stock is now down nearly 60% from its 2021 peak. This has left shares trading at just 16 times forward earnings. Meanwhile, the company’s market capitalization is down to $71 billion. That’s a pretty small figure for a company whose annual sales are expected to top $170 billion in 2023.As long as Chinese stocks as a group remain available to American investors, JD stock should be one of the leaders in its category.Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold: Interactive Brokers (IBKR)A concept image showing hands holding a globe with stock charts in the background.Source: ShutterstockInteractive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) is a leading discount brokerage firm. The company services a wide variety of customers ranging from small retail accounts to registered financial advisors to hedge funds. Interactive Brokers has a global reach, offering services to investors in dozens of countries. It also offers a vast array of tradable markets, including Europe, Asia, and even emerging markets such as Mexico, which are all available within a single trading account.The firm is set to benefit dramatically from higher interest rates. For starters, it gets to charge much higher interest rates on margin loans thanks to rising rates. The cost of a U.S. dollar margin loan has gone up from 1.6% to 5.3% at Interactive in recent months thanks to the ongoing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Additionally, volatile markets tend to lead to more trading activity, which can boost profitability.IBRK stock isn’t just a near-term interest rate play, however. The company has long-term appeal. Founder Thomas Peterffy is a visionary within the brokerage services industry and has built his company to thrive on a generational timeframe. In addition, the company’s focus on low costs and excellent trading execution has led to the firm having a stellar reputation with professional traders. As the brokerage industry continues to consolidate, Interactive should be one of the biggest winners.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comIf you look through a list of Nasdaq stocks, there are a surprisingly high number of firms that have nothing to do with technology. Take PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), for example. The soft drink and snack foods maker is one of the safest and most reliable blue chip stocks listed on the Nasdaq.PepsiCo will rarely wow investors with an amazing performance in any given year. Over time, however, the company’s shares have steadily marched upward, with an average annual return of 12% over the past decade. The company is also a dividend machine. It has increased its annual dividend for 50 years in a row, putting it among the elite Dividend Kings.Some investors might be put off by the fact that PEP stock is trading at nearly 25 times forward earnings. That’s fairly expensive, especially in a bear market. However, shares are worth the price, especially for long-term investors. Pepsico delivers reliable earnings year in and year out, and it pays investors an increasingly large dividend as well.Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold: Constellation Energy (CEG)Source: ShutterstockPower utility Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG) is another quality, sleep-well-at-night Nasdaq stock. The firm is one of the larger publicly traded electricity utilities with a market capitalization of nearly $30 billion.The company’s claim to fame is its large capacity for nuclear power generation. Nuclear power had been viewed as a fading asset in recent years due to high costs, regulatory pushback and a preference for other renewables. However, solar and wind have run into some pricing and capacity issues of their own. Meanwhile, the world is facing severe electricity generation issues in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.This has created something of a nuclear renaissance. Expect more research, investment, subsidies, and so on to go into nuclear going forward as policymakers increasingly look to nuclear as a “bridge” capacity generator between fossil fuels and green renewables. The Inflation Reduction Act, for example, provided significant subsidies to carbon-free power production, which includes nuclear.Constellation shares just started trading in early 2022, as it was spun off from another power utility. Shares are up more than 130% since then. Expect CEG stock to continue rallying as more investors discover this unique clean energy utility.CSX Corporation (CSX)Is It Time for Investors to Get On Board CSX Stock?Source: ShutterstockRailroad operator CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) is another firm that most people probably didn’t realize was on the Nasdaq. Railroads are an interesting asset class. They were the original American growth stocks. American railroad booms led to several bouts of market euphoria in the 1800s. Over a long enough time horizon, however, every new technology becomes a commodity product.Railroads have enjoyed a revival in recent years. Much of this is due to rising fuel prices. They have much better per-mile efficiency than trucks, which is a key consideration given soaring fuel prices. Also, there has been considerable progress in electrifying and automating rail transport. This improves economics for the industry while lowering its environmental footprint.Make no mistake about it, 2023 is going to be a rough year for railroads, including CSX. We’re likely to see big drops in sales of consumer durable goods such as appliances, building materials, automobiles, and so on. This means less cargo business for the rails. Over the longer-term, however, railroads are the best way to move large amounts of goods around, and operators like CSX have great profit margins thanks to local monopolies in many of the markets they serve.After a 20% decline this year, CSX stock now trades for just 15 times forward earnings.Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX)vet looking at a dog's xray to represent pet stocks like IDXXSource: ShutterstockIdexx Laboratories (NASDAQ:IDXX) is a life sciences company focused on animal health. It primarily offers solutions for companion animals, i.e., pets. Idexx has three main lines of business. It distributes in-clinic testing and screening products that veterinarians can use in their offices. It has a testing service where pet owners and vets can send samples to a network of Idexx-affiliated laboratories for processing. And there’s Idexx’s software business, which offers patient and practice management and client outreach for veterinarian offices.IDXX stock was one of the past decade’s unheralded winners. Shares soared more than 1,000% between 2012 and 2021. In 2022, Idexx has fallen by nearly 42%. However, the same factors that powered the stock’s 10-fold rally over the past decade persist. Namely, people are increasingly viewing their pets as family. As folks have tended to have fewer kids in recent years, it has freed up more money and attention for animal companions. The pandemic accelerated this trend as people were stuck at home and looking for company.IDXX stock sold off as the pandemic-induced animal adoption boom came to an end. But the longer-term trend hasn’t changed, and shares will be back to full health in due time.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in TXN stock.

This compares to earnings of $1.30 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 0.85%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $1.07 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.09, delivering a surprise of 1.87%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.U.S. Bancorp , which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, posted revenues of $6.3 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.30%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.86 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.U.S. Bancorp shares have lost about 26.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -23%.What's Next for U.S. Bancorp?While U.S. Bancorp has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for U.S. Bancorp: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.15 on $6.46 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.42 on $24.3 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Banks - Major Regional is currently in the bottom 35% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Comerica Incorporated (CMA), has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on October 19.This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.57 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +35.3%.

India has also set 2070 as the deadline to become a net-zero, or carbon-neutral, nation.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatMore than half of India’s energy needs are already dependent on coal. These new projects are now likely to jeopardise India’s ambitious plans.Experts, too, have warned that a “lack of strategy” will slow down India’s progress on this front. “The biggest hurdle for India towards achieving net zero right now is the lack of a clear direction of moving away from fossil fuels...Which results in wrong investments in polluting technologies and would slow down the progress towards net zero as well as lead to stranded and non-performing assets,” Sunil Dahiya, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air analyst, had told Quartz in September.Does India really need new coal projects?In April and May this year, India witnessed a temporary but massive shortage of coal amid high demand for power. This triggered prime minister Narendra Modi’s government into planning new projects.The demand for coal, in any case, is expected to rise to 784.6 million tonnes for the financial year ending March 2023, according to research by Global Energy Monitor (GEM), a San Francisco-based NGO studying the global energy landscape.Indian finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, too, was explicit in her assessment yesterday (Oct. 16) about rising coal demand. She said, “...it’s not just India. Many countries have gone back. And coal is now going to be back again because I think gas cannot be afforded. Or it is not available as much as you want.”Story continuesThe price India will pay for its coal needsIndia’s 99 new coal projects will potentially put 165 villages and 87,630 families at risk of displacement. More than 41,000 of these families belong to the scheduled tribe category, noted GEM’s research.There’s also been criticism around India’s rush while existing coal projects remain underutilised.“On average, India’s coal mines use only two-thirds of the capacity with some large ones using only 1%,” GEM noted.]"

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 15 cents, or 0.2%, at $85.46 after a 7.6% decline last week.""U.S. inflation remains a front topic and with the Fed set to raise rates at least into next year, there are fears that demand destruction will escalate,"" said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading at BOK Financial.China's central bank rolled over maturing medium-term policy loans on Monday while keeping its key interest rate unchanged for a second month, in a signal that loose monetary policy would be maintained.Beijing will also greatly increase domestic energy supply capacity and step up risk controls in key commodities including coal, oil, gas and electricity, a senior National Energy Administration official said on Monday.China will further increase reserve capacities for key commodities, another state official told a news conference in Beijing.Chinese trade and third-quarter GDP data, along with September activity data, are due to be released on Tuesday, with quarterly growth possibly rebounding from the previous quarter but annual growth threatening to be China's worst in almost half a century.Meanwhile, a strong U.S. dollar and the likelihood of further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve are helping to contain price gains.St. Louis Fed President James Bullard on Friday said inflation had become ""pernicious"" and difficult to arrest, warranting continued ""frontloading"" through larger rate increases of three-quarters of a percentage point.Inflation in the United States remains stubborn and growth in European Union countries is expected to weaken to 0.5%, International Monetary Fund official Gita Gopinath said on Monday.Story continues""It's been another turbulent few weeks in oil markets from global growth concerns to super-sized OPEC+ output cuts and it seems they're yet to fully settle down,"" said Craig Erlam, senior markets analyst at OANDA.""Brent has seen lows of $82 and highs of $98, so perhaps what we're now seeing is it finding its feet somewhere in the middle.""Oil supply is likely to remain tight after OPEC and allies including Russia pledged on Oct. 5 to cut output by 2 million barrels per day while a war of words between OPEC's de facto leader Saudi Arabia and the United States could foreshadow more volatility.OPEC+ output cuts attracted funds back to the oil markets, with continued heavy buying of crude oil futures and options for a second straight week.Easing the supply crunch, oil output in the Permian in Texas and New Mexico, the biggest U.S. shale oil basin, is due to rise by about 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) to a record 5.453 million bpd in November, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its productivity report on Monday.(Additional reporting by Noah Browning in London, Mohi Narayan in New Delhi and Florence Tan in Singapore; Editing by Susan Fenton, Kirsten Donovan, David Goodman, Ed Osmond, Paul Simao and David Gregorio)]"

Both contracts recovered from a 7% loss last week, which was spurred by a strengthening dollar and a bigger-than-expected inventory increase in the United States.OPEC+ members reiterated their support for the supply cut amid a growing rift between the United States and Saudi Arabia, the leader of the cartel. The Biden administration criticized the production cut, stating that it will increase oil prices and support Russia’s war effort against Ukraine by giving Moscow higher crude revenues.Washington also accused OPEC leader Saudi Arabia of coercing smaller members into complying with the cut.Several OPEC+ members denied that the cut had political motivations, arguing that it was instead to stabilize crude prices. News of the cut had sent oil prices soaring earlier this month, with assurances of stability by the cartel supporting a bullish outlook for crude prices.But the U.S. had also responded to the supply cut by releasing 7.7 million barrels of oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) last week, in order to bring down crude prices.The U.S. has steadily drawn from the SPR this year to help cap gasoline prices at home and to lower the amount of oil revenue received by Russia. The Biden administration has now threatened to release more oil in light of the supply cut, which could cause near-term volatility in crude markets.Story continuesNear term demand for crude may also come under pressure from more disruptions in China. President Xi Jinping  on Sunday said the country will stick to its zero-COVID policy, despite widespread damage to the Chinese economy this year.But the Chinese president also said that Beijing will ramp up spending and stimulus to help shore up economic growth. Slowing economic activity in China saw its crude imports drop drastically this year.Related ArticlesOil Rises as OPEC+ Members Voice Support For Supply CutGold Pinned Below $1,650, Copper Awaits Major Production ReportsOPEC+ members line up to endorse output cut after U.S. coercion claim]"

Rather, it was the matter-of-fact tone around potentially moving interest rates to the 4.5% to 5% range and the stickiness of inflation.I have been struck by the tone of the economy elsewhere, too.I just spoke at length with Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus. Mr. Marcus may be a 93-year-old billionaire, but by no means is he mailing it in.Marcus remains very active in helping small businesses, is plugged into all things politics (yes, he was a Trump supporter), and keeps a close eye on how Home Depot is performing. Marcus flat-out told me that inflation is going to crush the economy and that regulations are strangling small businesses.Even adjusting for Marcus' political leanings, it was striking to hear that tone about the economy from a business leader.And then, I wake up at 4 am on Saturday and find these comments on the economy from Jefferies Chief Economist Aneta Markowska:""After a ’stronger for longer‘ expansion, we envision a recession that comes later than consensus currently expects but hits the economy much harder than anticipated. Consensus expects a mild recession starting in Q1 and lasting about 3 quarters. We believe it will start later (around Q3) and last longer (5 quarters).""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Aneta isn't one of those fear-mongering newsletter hawkers.

Lastly, while Other Bets still appears inefficient, losses make up both a very small percentage of cash and market cap.

Yet, not all of them present an equally good opportunity.Trading at a favorable P/E ratio, with strong dividends and improving profit margins, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBA) is an interesting prospect in the pharmaceutical sector.View our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots AllianceWBA Latest Earnings ResultsWalgreens Boots Alliance announced earnings results on 13th OctoberEPS: US$5.02 (up from US$2.31 in FY 2021).Revenue: US$132.7b (flat on FY 2021).Net income: US$4.34b (up 118% from FY 2021).Profit margin: 3.3% (up from 1.5% in FY 2021).EPS missed analyst estimates by 15%, although the profit margin increased. The earnings per share have increased by 35% per year over the last 3 years, but the stock price has fallen by 16% - thus, it is significantly lagging behind the earnings.WBA Fiscal 2023 OutlookAdjusted EPS: US$4.46-4.65 vs. US$4.49 consensusU.S. Healthcare fiscal year 2025 sales target: US$11b-12b (from US$9b-10b)Positive adjusted EBITDA is expected to be achieved in 2024 (Currently, it was negative due to non-cash impairment charges related to intangible assets in Boots UK and higher costs of the Transformational Cost Management Program).What Catches an Eye About WBA?ValuationTrading at 6.6x the earnings, WBA stock is well below the sector's average. In fact, it is likely the lowest in the industry – even if accounting for the forward-looking P/E, which sits at 9.3% WBA P/E vs. sector, October 16, 2022  Trading at 6.6x the earnings, WBA stock is well below the sector's average. It is likely the lowest in the industry – even if accounting for the forward-looking P/E, which sits at 9.3%. According to our consensus price target, an average 1y price sits at US$40.17, representing a 20.8% upside.Story continuesDividendWBA is on the pace to become a ""dividend king"" as it has increased its dividends for 46 years. With that kind of track record and a yield of 5.8%, it is natural that the company attracts interest from yield-seekers, especially as it pays way above the average for this industry.As a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our curated list of dividend stocks yielding above 3%.Looking Beyond the Surface – Not An Opportunity for Risk AverseDespite being undervalued on the surface, looking at the longer-term chart showing the price to free cash flow indicates a persistent downtrend.To an extent, this is a result of the restructuring that has been going on for years following the Boots Alliance merger in 2015 and various asset sales and acquisitions. While this brought an explosive growth of revenue which almost doubled in the last 10 years, the cost of revenues followed, nullifying them – showing that the company is yet failing to achieve sustainable growth.Finally, the management seems to be looking forward too much, dismissing the known short-term facts in favor of the favorable projections for fiscal years 2023 and 2024. That behavior is questionable given the ongoing macroeconomic environment and market turbulences that might lie ahead.

That job belongs to the S&amp;P 500. The Dow’s headline-grabbing swoons and rallies – “Dow Falls 1,200 Points” or “Dow Rallies 1,000 Points!” – pulls readers in. Often, these headlines then get investors to start wondering about the best Dow stocks to buy.Of course, the fact that these mega-cap stocks tend to move in higher point terms on a daily basis doesn’t really imply much. Rather, it’s the value these stocks display as very good long-term holdings that most investors ought to get excited about.That said, even the top Dow stocks many like don’t always pan out. Names like General Electric (NYSE:GE) immediately come to mind. However, many others like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the most successful companies in their respective industries.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that in mind, let’s look for a few Dow stocks to buy amid the current 2022 bear market.MSFTMicrosoft$234.24WBAWalgreens$33.65CRMSalesforce$145.44Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the strongest businesses in tech. This software company has built a moat so wide and deep that it should keep the competition at bay for decades to come.Microsoft dominates the enterprise business with its Office, Teams and Azure platforms. Inroads into gaming, social media (via LinkedIn) and other avenues only cement its lead at the top. As a result, Microsoft has put together a fortress balance sheet and a business that generates massive cash flows.While this fact may fly under the radar, investors may not realize that Microsoft’s operating margins are better than all other FAANG stocks.Better yet, consensus expectations call for 10% to 15% annual earnings and revenue growth through FY 2026. Combined with the fact that Microsoft trades at just 22-times this year’s earnings, this stock is hard to ignore.Story continuesThat said, for investors seeking deep value, let’s see if Microsoft stock tests the $210 to $215 area.Walgreens (WBA)Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comWalgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) isn’t a flawless stock by any means, hence the destruction we’ve seen in the stock price. Shares are down more than 45% from this decade’s high and are down more than 60% from its all-time high in 2015.That said, there are some attractive qualities to Walgreens.First, the stock pays out a 5.9% dividend yield, the third-highest yield in Dow. Second, shares trade at the insultingly low valuation of just 5.7-times this year’s earnings. For what it’s worth, Walgreens is forecast to generate 2% earnings growth on flat revenue growth this year.However, the bigger problem is next year, as consensus estimates call for a 9% dip in earnings despite 1% growth in revenue. The earnings dip could accelerate if the economy deteriorates further.But at what point do we overlook flat earnings growth this year and a sub-10% deceleration next year in lieu of a stock trading at 6.5-times earnings with a ~6% dividend yield? On top of that, the payout ratio of just 35% suggests the dividend should be rather secure.Steal Price: $23 to $26.Salesforce (CRM)A hand with pink painted fingernails holds a Salesforce sticker.Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.comLast but not least, we have Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). There are a number of stocks that could have gone in this slot and many of which are performing relatively well vs. the Dow and the S&amp;P 500. Salesforce is not one of those names, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t one of the Dow stocks to buy if we can get a steal of a deal.Shares have suffered a peak-to-trough decline of 55% amid this correction, and made new lows as recently as this week.Earlier this year, the company stated that broader economic pressures had not hurt its business. As of last quarter though, some of that pressure and a rising dollar finally caught up with Salesforce. Despite that, the company still delivered a top- and bottom-line beat with revenue growing 21.8% year over year.However, less than a month later, the company set a target of $50 billion in revenue for FY 2026 (vs. estimates of “just” $45 billion at the time). Keep in mind, Salesforce is already operating in FY 2023, while analysts expect 14% to 17% annual revenue growth from now until then.Steal Price: $115 to $125, with a preference toward the lower end of the range.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This will take the annual payment to 2.5% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. Check out our latest analysis for Starbucks Starbucks' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. The last dividend was quite comfortably covered by Starbucks' earnings, but it was a bit tighter on the cash flow front. The company is clearly earning enough to pay this type of dividend, but it is definitely focused on returning cash to shareholders, rather than growing the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 21.5%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 52%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendStarbucks Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.34 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.12. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 20% a year over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Starbucks has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 13% per annum. Earnings are on the uptrend, and it is only paying a small portion of those earnings to shareholders.Our Thoughts On Starbucks' DividendIn summary, it's great to see that the company can raise the dividend and keep it in a sustainable range. On the plus side, the dividend looks sustainable by most measures but it is let down by the lack of cash flows. Taking all of this into consideration, the dividend looks viable moving forward, but investors should be mindful that the company has pushed the boundaries of sustainability in the past and may do so again.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Just as an example, we've come across 3 warning signs for Starbucks you should be aware of, and 2 of them are significant.

Electric vehicles, biotechnology, social networking stocks, cloud software companies and the like. These are the sort of companies that can go up five- or 10-fold if their businesses find sustained market success. On the other hand, their stocks can easily end up losing most of their value if anything goes wrong and/or there is a broader correction in the tech sector.Over the past year, the Nasdaq is down 33.5%, with many of the individual components suffering far greater losses as investors refocused their attention from future growth to current profits and cash flows. It feels as though investors are hyper-focused on short-term losses rather than long-term potential, such as where a company may be in, say, 2030.On the bright side, this year’s bear market has created some stellar opportunities for long-term investors looking for Nasdaq stocks to buy and hold.

Analog semiconductors are vital because they turn real-world information such as weather conditions into data. The ability to sense and process external information is crucial for enabling cutting-edge technologies such as autonomous driving, remote monitoring and internet of things applications.Semiconductor shortages in 2021 led to high prices and record profits across the industry. The boom has turned into a bust this year, however, as demand for consumer electronics such as televisions and laptops has dropped significantly from peak 2021 levels. Texas Instruments has been able to sidestep much of this cyclical pain, though, since its analog chips tend to go into slower-moving industrial markets rather than hot consumer products.Story continuesTexas Instruments is also a cash flow machine. Management is laser-focused on the metric, noting in a recent presentation: “We believe that growth of free cash flow per share is the primary driver of long-term value.”This focus has worked out well for shareholders. Over the past 10 years, TXN stock has averaged a 20.6% return and it offers a 3.1% dividend yield.JD.com (JD)JD.com (JD) logo displayed at the entrance to the company's Silicon Valley office.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comChinese tech stocks have been an abject failure over the past year.

In addition, JD has invested heavily in logistics, which has powered fast and reliable delivery schedules.JD stock is now down nearly 60% from its 2021 peak. This has left shares trading at just 16 times forward earnings. Meanwhile, the company’s market capitalization is down to $71 billion. That’s a pretty small figure for a company whose annual sales are expected to top $170 billion in 2023.As long as Chinese stocks as a group remain available to American investors, JD stock should be one of the leaders in its category.Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold: Interactive Brokers (IBKR)A concept image showing hands holding a globe with stock charts in the background.Source: ShutterstockInteractive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) is a leading discount brokerage firm. The company services a wide variety of customers ranging from small retail accounts to registered financial advisors to hedge funds. Interactive Brokers has a global reach, offering services to investors in dozens of countries. It also offers a vast array of tradable markets, including Europe, Asia, and even emerging markets such as Mexico, which are all available within a single trading account.The firm is set to benefit dramatically from higher interest rates. For starters, it gets to charge much higher interest rates on margin loans thanks to rising rates. The cost of a U.S. dollar margin loan has gone up from 1.6% to 5.3% at Interactive in recent months thanks to the ongoing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Additionally, volatile markets tend to lead to more trading activity, which can boost profitability.IBRK stock isn’t just a near-term interest rate play, however. The company has long-term appeal. Founder Thomas Peterffy is a visionary within the brokerage services industry and has built his company to thrive on a generational timeframe. In addition, the company’s focus on low costs and excellent trading execution has led to the firm having a stellar reputation with professional traders. As the brokerage industry continues to consolidate, Interactive should be one of the biggest winners.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comIf you look through a list of Nasdaq stocks, there are a surprisingly high number of firms that have nothing to do with technology. Take PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), for example. The soft drink and snack foods maker is one of the safest and most reliable blue chip stocks listed on the Nasdaq.PepsiCo will rarely wow investors with an amazing performance in any given year. Over time, however, the company’s shares have steadily marched upward, with an average annual return of 12% over the past decade. The company is also a dividend machine. It has increased its annual dividend for 50 years in a row, putting it among the elite Dividend Kings.Some investors might be put off by the fact that PEP stock is trading at nearly 25 times forward earnings. That’s fairly expensive, especially in a bear market. However, shares are worth the price, especially for long-term investors. Pepsico delivers reliable earnings year in and year out, and it pays investors an increasingly large dividend as well.Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold: Constellation Energy (CEG)Source: ShutterstockPower utility Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG) is another quality, sleep-well-at-night Nasdaq stock. The firm is one of the larger publicly traded electricity utilities with a market capitalization of nearly $30 billion.The company’s claim to fame is its large capacity for nuclear power generation. Nuclear power had been viewed as a fading asset in recent years due to high costs, regulatory pushback and a preference for other renewables. However, solar and wind have run into some pricing and capacity issues of their own. Meanwhile, the world is facing severe electricity generation issues in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.This has created something of a nuclear renaissance. Expect more research, investment, subsidies, and so on to go into nuclear going forward as policymakers increasingly look to nuclear as a “bridge” capacity generator between fossil fuels and green renewables. The Inflation Reduction Act, for example, provided significant subsidies to carbon-free power production, which includes nuclear.Constellation shares just started trading in early 2022, as it was spun off from another power utility. Shares are up more than 130% since then. Expect CEG stock to continue rallying as more investors discover this unique clean energy utility.CSX Corporation (CSX)Is It Time for Investors to Get On Board CSX Stock?Source: ShutterstockRailroad operator CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) is another firm that most people probably didn’t realize was on the Nasdaq. Railroads are an interesting asset class. They were the original American growth stocks. American railroad booms led to several bouts of market euphoria in the 1800s. Over a long enough time horizon, however, every new technology becomes a commodity product.Railroads have enjoyed a revival in recent years. Much of this is due to rising fuel prices. They have much better per-mile efficiency than trucks, which is a key consideration given soaring fuel prices. Also, there has been considerable progress in electrifying and automating rail transport. This improves economics for the industry while lowering its environmental footprint.Make no mistake about it, 2023 is going to be a rough year for railroads, including CSX. We’re likely to see big drops in sales of consumer durable goods such as appliances, building materials, automobiles, and so on. This means less cargo business for the rails. Over the longer-term, however, railroads are the best way to move large amounts of goods around, and operators like CSX have great profit margins thanks to local monopolies in many of the markets they serve.After a 20% decline this year, CSX stock now trades for just 15 times forward earnings.Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX)vet looking at a dog's xray to represent pet stocks like IDXXSource: ShutterstockIdexx Laboratories (NASDAQ:IDXX) is a life sciences company focused on animal health. It primarily offers solutions for companion animals, i.e., pets. Idexx has three main lines of business. It distributes in-clinic testing and screening products that veterinarians can use in their offices. It has a testing service where pet owners and vets can send samples to a network of Idexx-affiliated laboratories for processing. And there’s Idexx’s software business, which offers patient and practice management and client outreach for veterinarian offices.IDXX stock was one of the past decade’s unheralded winners. Shares soared more than 1,000% between 2012 and 2021. In 2022, Idexx has fallen by nearly 42%. However, the same factors that powered the stock’s 10-fold rally over the past decade persist. Namely, people are increasingly viewing their pets as family. As folks have tended to have fewer kids in recent years, it has freed up more money and attention for animal companions. The pandemic accelerated this trend as people were stuck at home and looking for company.IDXX stock sold off as the pandemic-induced animal adoption boom came to an end. But the longer-term trend hasn’t changed, and shares will be back to full health in due time.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in TXN stock.

37,366318e0-5052-3ae2-afb0-18305bcdfee3,LUV,2022-10-17,7 Stocks to Buy Regardless of Q3 Earnings,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-regardless-q3-164232390.html,1665679352,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'CVX', 'LUV', 'MSFT', 'AAPL']","[Third quarter earnings season is approaching fast. So I wanted to take a look at stocks to buy. In particular, these stocks have underlying fundamentals that continue to perform well, despite market headwinds. At the same time, the S&amp;P 500 Index needs a major shot in the arm. It continues to shed value, with the Federal Reserve continually raising interest rates. Hence, it needs a sustainable boost that isn’t contingent on expert opinions on interest and inflation rate expectations.However, it seems that the current earnings season will be tough for the S&amp;P 500. A recent Earnings Trend report by Zacks shows a remarkably bleak picture, forecasting just a 1.3% earnings expansion for the quarter. So unfortunately, the stock market is in for another shock.Still, even against this news, the bear market does offer a good deal of opportunity for investors looking to invest in wide-moat stocks at bargain valuations. With that, here are seven stocks to buy you may want to consider today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCVXChevron$164.43LUVSouthwest Airlines$32.29AAPLApple$140.42VVisa$181.75MSFTMicrosoft$232.47UNHUnitedHealth$503.16KOCoca-Cola$55.51Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comEnergy giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has been one of the most consistent performers in the oil and gas sector. It’s also one of the top stocks to buy. Despite the sector’s cyclical nature, it has grown its top line by double-digit margins over the past years. Moreover, it continues to raise its dividend even in the most unprecedented times. It boasts a 34-year streak of consecutive increases in annual dividends, making it a dividend aristocrat.Chevron is riding the tailwinds in the sphere generating over 70% growth in sales year-over-year on the back of higher margins. Consequently, it has helped produce a gusher of free cash flow for the business. Also, its management is using the added funds to invest in both new and traditional energy. It has significantly ramped up investments, spending more than 80% in its first half than it did in the same period last year.Story continuesSouthwest Airlines (LUV)a close-up shot of an airplane engineSource: frank_peters / Shutterstock.comSouthwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) is the world’s top low-cost carrier in terms of fleet size. It operates 726 aircraft and claims to have the fourth-largest fleet. Similar to its peers, it was able to capitalize on the pent-up demand for travel post-pandemic with triple-digit growth in sales. However, the current economic headwinds are playing spoilsport. Nevertheless, LUV is in a strong position to wrap up the year with aplomb regardless of the market conditions.The airliner set a record for quarterly profits in the second quarter and expects its performance to continue for the rest of the year. It noted a massive surge in leisure demand, which should factor into its upcoming quarterly results. Business travel hasn’t been up to snuff, but leisure sales continue to exceed expectations and should offset lower revenues from business bookings.Apple (AAPL)Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) develops some of the most addictive products globally and has established itself as arguably the most valuable company. Take it from the Oracle of Omaha; Warren Buffet, one of the company’s largest shareholders, believes it’s the best business he knows. The secret behind Apple’s incredible success is the stickiness of its products.Not only does the iPhone command over 50% of the smartphone market, but its add-on services have also ensured that customers stay with the product for the long haul. Apple services generated $32.7 billion in sales in 2017, but that number doubled to a whopping $68.4 billion by last year.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives recently talked about how 24% of iPhone users globally haven’t upgraded their phones in the past 3.5 years. Hence, with enormous pent-up demand, this could mark the beginning of the next major product cycle for the iPhone.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comShares of payments processing giant Visa (NYSE:V) have held up substantially better than the broader market. A lot has to do with its robust results of late, which will continue to improve in line with the improvement in travel demand.In its most recent quarter, it generated a massive $7.3 billion in sales, up 18.7% from the prior-year period. The massive growth during the quarter was driven by impressive performance across all its core segments. Payments volume was up 8%, driven by border reopenings and the resultant increase in higher consumer spending from international travelers.In addition to the larger revenue base, company margins improved considerably during the quarter, with its dividend yield averaging at 0.7%, slightly higher than its 10-year average of 0.6%. Despite the strong performance, it remains a bargain for growth investors.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another one of the top stocks to buy. It’s also one of the most diversified tech giants benefiting from multiple opportunities in the cloud, digital transformation, and gaming markets. Consequently, its top and bottom line have grown by an incredible 15.6% and 23.3% over the past five years, with multiple years of expansion ahead. Moreover, it continues to generate tons of cash flows and profits, including $65 billion in free cash flows over the past 12 months. Its stellar cash production has enabled investors to steadily rising dividend income and share repurchases.Naturally, the economic slowdown has led to a deceleration in growth rates for MSFT. Nevertheless, its dominant positioning in multiple lucrative tech verticals shouldn’t deter investors from wagering on it for the long haul. For instance, its Windows operating system commands a 76% share of the desktop PC space. Moreover, its Azure platform, with a 21% market share in the cloud sphere, has proven to be more profitable than Amazon Web Services. Hence, its entrenched position should allow it to hold its competitors at bay in multiple markets and expand its presence in others.UnitedHealth (UNH)UNH Stock Have Four More YearsSource: ShutterstockUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is a leading managed care and health insurance business. It’s been an incredible wealth compounder, generating over 1,000% returns over the past decade. Moreover, it boasts a spectacular track record of growing earnings and sales over the years.There was plenty for investors to celebrate in the second quarter. Earnings shot up 18.5% while sales grew an impressive 13%. It added 280,000 new members across all its membership options, becoming a huge source of new revenues in the upcoming quarters.Furthermore, the company is likely to see growth through inorganic expansion. It is looking to expand into the mental health market and in markets outside of the U.S. Additionally, the firm has raised its dividend for 12 straight years. It also announced plans to bump its annual dividends by 13.8% to $1.65 per share, an encouraging sign for long-term investors.Coca-Cola (KO)Finally, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) should also be considered one of the top stocks to buy. It’s also one of the most iconic brands, with some prominent fans, including Warren Buffet. It is a stalwart in the consumer staples sector, boasting timeless brands that continue to resonate with a global audience. Moreover, it has been one of the most reliable income stocks, with 60 consecutive years of dividend increases, making it a dividend king.Its operating performance has held up amazingly despite market headwinds. The inelasticity of demand for its products has ensured that it can effectively raise prices without substantially impacting sales. Its recently released operating results are a testament to that notion.KO stock has shed a fair share of its value this year, and for those looking to invest in a reliable dividend investment at a fair price, it’s arguably the best bet.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing GuidelinesMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

""But growth requires confidence and stability, and the United Kingdom will always pay its way.""Under the new plan, most of Truss's 45 billion pounds of unfunded tax cuts will go and a two-year energy support scheme for households and businesses - expected to cost well over 100 billion pounds - will now only run until April.After that the government will review the best way forward, to come up with a targeted scheme that will ""cost the taxpayer significantly less than planned"".Hunt said the planned tax cut changes would raise 32 billion pounds ($36 billion) every year. The pound soared by as much as 1.4% to a session high of $1.1332 after the statement.Truss said she was now charting a new course for growth, but one that would protect stability. ""We have taken action to chart a new course for growth that supports and delivers for people across the United Kingdom,"" she said on Twitter.Story continuesFIGHTING FOR SURVIVALThe latest crisis to hit the British shores started on Sept. 23, when new prime minister Truss and her-then finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng announced 45 billion pounds of unfunded tax cuts to snap the economy out of years of stagnation.But the response from bond investors who would fund the plan was so violently negative that borrowing costs surged and lenders pulled mortgage offers. Eventually the Bank of England had to step in to prevent pension funds from going under.After reversing one tax cut, Truss fired her long-time friend Kwarteng on Friday and installed Hunt, the former health and foreign minister, to cut others.Adding to the pressure, the Bank stuck to its schedule of ending its support on Friday, meaning Hunt had been racing to reverse policies and find spending cuts to appease the markets and prevent borrowing costs from rising further on Monday morning.Despite Monday's rally, the damage to gilts endures. The yield on the 10-year gilt is still some 46 basis points above its closing level on Sept. 22, the day before the ""Growth Plan"" shocked markets. While yields for comparable German and U.S. bonds have increased over the same period, the hit to British debt remains especially severe.Truss's spokesman was asked at a daily briefing how the prime minister could retain any credibility after she reversed course on the programme that secured her election by party members.He said she was listening to the public, her colleagues and to the advice of the markets. ""She is making the necessary difficult decisions to change our approach so we can provide the economic stability and maintain that stability of leadership which is important as well,"" he said.Her about-turn has angered those lawmakers who supported her, and further encouraged those who opposed her to try to find a way of getting her out of power.The fourth British prime minister in six years, she was only formerly appointed to the role on Sept. 6.Already a handful of her lawmakers have said she must go. Rachel Reeves, the finance spokesperson for the opposition Labour Party, said the Conservative government was no longer capable of providing stability.""The Conservatives have lost all credibility,"" she said.While Hunt had been expected to reverse some of the tax cuts, the change to the energy support scheme came out of the blue.Truss had announced a two-year subsidy scheme to support households and businesses through the period of surging energy prices, which would cost 60 billion pounds in six months alone. Hunt said on Monday that the scheme would now run until April, but become more targeted after that.The new finance minister would still deliver a fuller medium-term fiscal plan as scheduled on Oct. 31, alongside forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury said.

45,65c68e5b-3bf2-3710-b8fb-a71568bd5d7c,GS,2022-10-17,UPDATE 5-Goldman plans major overhaul to combine key units -source,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-goldman-combine-investment-banking-030801296.html,1665976081,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[(Adds sourcing, shares)By Pamela Barbaglia, Saeed Azhar and Lananh NguyenLONDON/NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs is planning a major reorganization to combine its biggest businesses into three divisions with its investment banking and trading businesses being merged into a single unit, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.The plans are expected to be announced on Oct. 18 alongside Goldman's third quarter earnings. Marcus, Goldman's consumer banking business, will be absorbed into the wealth unit, the sources said, confirming an earlier Wall Street Journal report.A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs declined to comment.This is the biggest shakeup since the company's investor day in early 2020 when it outlined plans for four core units: investment banking, global markets, consumer and wealth management and asset management.""It's a head scratcher,"" said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at Wells Fargo. ""Right now, there are more questions than answers for Goldman Sachs as it relates to this potential restructuring.""The company's stock rose 2.2% on Monday, underperforming the broader S&amp;P 500 index which was up 2.6%.The reorganization comes as the Wall Street titan seeks to boost its income from fee-based businesses and cut its reliance on volatile trading and investment banking revenues. The changes also signal Marcus, the consumer unit, is being relegated after Chief Executive Officer David Solomon expressed big ambitions to build a mainstream digital bank.""This may be a way to put Marcus to the back burner as a way to de-emphasize its importance as an investment opportunity,"" Mayo said.Solomon, who became CEO in 2018, has sought to expand Goldman's footprint in retail banking since his early days at the helm.But the consumer banking unit that launched in 2016 has struggled to gain traction and suffered from delays. Marcus has yet to launch a checking account that was scheduled for this year. At mid-year, the bank internally forecast that Marcus' losses would accelerate to more than $1.2 billion in 2022, for cumulative losses of more than $4 billion, Bloomberg reported. Goldman declined to comment on the loss.Story continuesSolomon has said the business could generate revenue of over $4 billion by end of 2024.Net revenue in the consumer-banking unit grew by 23% to $1.49 billion in 2021, reflecting higher credit card and deposit balances, the bank said in its annual report.Marcus offers digital banking products such as loans, savings and certificate of deposits. It also provides credit cards via a partnership with Apple Inc.The consumer business serves more than 14 million customers and had more than $100 billion in deposits with over $16 billion in cards and loans balances, the bank has said.OVERHAUL KEEPS MANAGEMENT 'ON ITS TOES'The combined investment banking and trading group will be overseen by Dan Dees and Jim Esposito, who are currently global co-heads of Goldman's investment banking, and Ashok Varadhan, now co-head of its global markets division, according to Bloomberg.Marc Nachmann, the bank's global co-head of the global markets division, will move to help run the combined asset- and wealth-management arm, the report said.Marcus will become a part of the asset and wealth management unit, the report added.""This is a way for Goldman Sachs to keep its management team on its toes and to reinforce the intensity that defines Goldman,"" Mayo said.Such an organizational overhaul of the bank comes shortly after its global job cuts in September that could have impacted hundreds of bankers.In the second quarter, Goldman reported a 48% slump in profit that beat forecasts as fixed-income and commodities trading surged.Like its Wall Street rivals, the bank is expected to report a sharp drop in third-quarter net profit as investment banking revenue was badly hurt by a slump in dealmaking.Goldman is expected to deliver a net profit of $2.77 billion in the third quarter, according to analysts' forecasts compiled by Refinitiv, down from $5.38 billion a year earlier.Given the tough operating environment, Goldman is closely re-examining all of its forward spending and investment plans to ensure the best use of its resources, Barclays said in a recent report.

Marcus, Goldman's consumer banking business, will be absorbed into the wealth unit, the sources said, confirming an earlier Wall Street Journal report.A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs declined to comment.This is the biggest shakeup since the company's investor day in early 2020 when it outlined plans for four core units: investment banking, global markets, consumer and wealth management and asset management.""It's a head scratcher,"" said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at Wells Fargo. ""Right now, there are more questions than answers for Goldman Sachs as it relates to this potential restructuring.""The company's stock rose 2.2% on Monday, underperforming the broader S&amp;P 500 index which was up 2.6%.The reorganization comes as the Wall Street titan seeks to boost its income from fee-based businesses and cut its reliance on volatile trading and investment banking revenues. The changes also signal Marcus, the consumer unit, is being relegated after Chief Executive Officer David Solomon expressed big ambitions to build a mainstream digital bank.""This may be a way to put Marcus to the back burner as a way to de-emphasize its importance as an investment opportunity,"" Mayo said.Solomon, who became CEO in 2018, has sought to expand Goldman's footprint in retail banking since his early days at the helm.But the consumer banking unit that launched in 2016 has struggled to gain traction and suffered from delays. Marcus has yet to launch a checking account that was scheduled for this year. At mid-year, the bank internally forecast that Marcus' losses would accelerate to more than $1.2 billion in 2022, for cumulative losses of more than $4 billion, Bloomberg reported. Goldman declined to comment on the loss.Story continuesSolomon has said the business could generate revenue of over $4 billion by end of 2024.Net revenue in the consumer-banking unit grew by 23% to $1.49 billion in 2021, reflecting higher credit card and deposit balances, the bank said in its annual report.Marcus offers digital banking products such as loans, savings and certificate of deposits. It also provides credit cards via a partnership with Apple Inc.The consumer business serves more than 14 million customers and had more than $100 billion in deposits with over $16 billion in cards and loans balances, the bank has said.OVERHAUL KEEPS MANAGEMENT 'ON ITS TOES'The combined investment banking and trading group will be overseen by Dan Dees and Jim Esposito, who are currently global co-heads of Goldman's investment banking, and Ashok Varadhan, now co-head of its global markets division, according to Bloomberg.Marc Nachmann, the bank's global co-head of the global markets division, will move to help run the combined asset- and wealth-management arm, the report said.Marcus will become a part of the asset and wealth management unit, the report added.""This is a way for Goldman Sachs to keep its management team on its toes and to reinforce the intensity that defines Goldman,"" Mayo said.Such an organizational overhaul of the bank comes shortly after its global job cuts in September that could have impacted hundreds of bankers.In the second quarter, Goldman reported a 48% slump in profit that beat forecasts as fixed-income and commodities trading surged.Like its Wall Street rivals, the bank is expected to report a sharp drop in third-quarter net profit as investment banking revenue was badly hurt by a slump in dealmaking.Goldman is expected to deliver a net profit of $2.77 billion in the third quarter, according to analysts' forecasts compiled by Refinitiv, down from $5.38 billion a year earlier.Given the tough operating environment, Goldman is closely re-examining all of its forward spending and investment plans to ensure the best use of its resources, Barclays said in a recent report.(Reporting by Pamela Barbaglia in London, Lavanya Ahire and Akriti Sharma in Bengaluru, Selena Li in Hong Kong, Saeed Azhar and Lananh Nguyen in New York; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips, Muralikumar Anantharaman and Nick Zieminski)]"

The NAS technology will be applicable to capture CO2 across a broad variety of industrial emissions.""With the world’s carbon budget running out, reducing emissions is a societal imperative,"" said Gavin Rennick, president of Schlumberger’s New Energy business. ""Carbon capture technologies are a key enabler in realizing a low carbon future—and we are excited about this exclusive agreement to work with RTI on industrializing and scaling this innovative carbon absorption technology, and bringing it to market.""The NAS technology offers a compelling alternative to conventional aqueous solvent technologies for carbon capture, as it consumes less energy while retaining high CO2 capacity, resulting in a material reduction in operating costs. The NAS technology is also less corrosive—eliminating the need for high-grade corrosion-resistant alloys and the associated increase in capital costs. This enhances the overall economics of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) projects.""RTI has developed the innovative NAS technology over the past 12 years, progressing from lab scale to large engineering scale,"" said Dr. Marty Lail, senior director of RTI’s Decarbonization Sciences program. ""NAS technology uses as much as 40% less energy during the CO2 capture process. High capture efficiency at lower energy cost is critical for widespread commercial use of carbon capture solvents.""As part of an engineering-scale carbon capture demonstration funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, NAS technology was able to remove &gt;99% of the CO2 from natural gas combustion exhaust streams—the highest capture efficiency reported for any carbon capture solvent technology for this application.Story continuesRTI and Schlumberger will collaborate to develop models that enable fast design and process customization to achieve a step-change in CO2 capture operations while leveraging Schlumberger’s global footprint to expand market opportunities for the technology.About SchlumbergerSchlumberger (NYSE: SLB) is a technology company that partners with customers to access energy.

Even though stock prices were relatively low, insiders elected to sell US$4.9m worth of stock in the last year, which could indicate some expected downturn.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Amgen Amgen Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP, Jonathan Graham, for US$3.3m worth of shares, at about US$242 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$251). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 40% of Jonathan Graham's holding.In the last year Amgen insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Amgen Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Amgen. In total, Lead Independent Director Robert Eckert sold US$1.6m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Does Amgen Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Amgen insiders own about US$210m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Amgen Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought Amgen stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, Amgen makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Amgen you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The core portfolio should have stocks that are worth holding for the long term. A dynamic portfolio can be focused on an event-based investment strategy. The focus of this column is on a core portfolio of stocks for investors over 30 to buy and hold.Even in the long-term portfolio, there needs to be diversification. First, in the form of exposure to different industries. Furthermore, in the form of balanced exposure to growth and blue-chip dividend stocks.Growth stocks for investors over 30 to buy and hold are typically names that will emerge as blue-chip stocks in the coming years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith the markets facing headwinds related to inflation and GDP growth, several quality stocks are available at mouth-watering valuations. It’s therefore a good time for a core portfolio creation that comfortably beats inflation and boosts retirement savings.CVXChevron Corporation$184.99PFEPfizer$46.86COSTCostco Wholesale$510.90TSLATesla$182.62PINSPinterest$22.98NEMNewmont Corporation$46.34LCIDLucid Group$12.17Chevron Corporation (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comThe International Energy Agency believes that the world faces its first truly global energy crisis. It’s likely that oil prices will remain above $80 per barrel in the coming years. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is a quality stock to buy and hold for dividend growth and capital gains.With a net-debt ratio of 4.9%, Chevron has an investment-grade balance sheet. Additionally, for Q3 2022, the company reported operating cash flow of $13.7 billion. With oil at $80 per barrel, the company has an annual cash flow visibility of $40 billion. This is a key reason to like CVX stock.Chevron also has high-quality assets. The company has plans to invest $15 to $17 billion annually through 2026. This will ensure robust reserve replacement and will continue to boost the company’s cash flow visibility.Story continuesPfizer (PFE)blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stockSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is a deeply undervalued stock that can create value for shareholders in the coming years. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 7.4, the 3.38% dividend yield stock is a screaming buy.Recently, Pfizer won a nod from the U.K. for a second omicron booster. It was also reported that Pfizer’s antiviral pill reduces the risk of long covid by 26%. While growth has decelerated for the company’s covid vaccine, the business will continue to deliver healthy cash flows.Pfizer’s bull story is also not just limited to the covid vaccine. The company has a deep product pipeline and strong financial flexibility to launch new drugs on a sustained basis. For the year, Pfizer plans to invest $11.5 to $12 billion in research and development.The pharma company has also been active on the acquisition front. This will help in boosting the product pipeline. Pfizer expects to add $25 billion in risk-adjusted 2030 revenue through business development.Costco Wholesale (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) stock has been sideways for the last 12 months. This seems like a good accumulation opportunity with the stock offering dividend growth at a CAGR of 12.35% in the last five years.It’s also important to note that consumer spending is the key GDP growth driver in the U.S. Costco is therefore a core portfolio stock as policymakers will continue to focus on policies for boosting retail spending.Amidst headwinds for the retail sector, Costco has possibly been the best performer in terms of growth. Once inflationary pressure wanes, meaningful EBITDA margin expansion seems likely.For the nine weeks ended October, the company reported 7.7% comparable store sales. With an improving omnichannel presence, the company’s comparable store sales growth has remained robust.In terms of recurring revenue, Costco reported $4.2 billion in membership fees in the last 12 months. With a 92.6% renewal rate in U.S. and Canada, the membership fee provides clear cash flow visibility. Further, as Costco expands in the U.S. and internationally, membership fees will continue to swell.Tesla (TSLA)Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TXSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.comIt’s been a challenging year for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock with a correction of 52%. I still recommend the high-beta stock for the core portfolio at current valuations.It’s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the adoption of electric vehicles globally. For investors who are bullish on the EV theme, TSLA stock remains the top pick. The company has ambitious growth plans with a target of selling 20 million EVs annually by 2030. With government support globally for EV adoption, this seems realistic.Tesla also has strong financial flexibility to achieve this target. As of Q3 2022, the company reported $21 billion in cash. Additionally, for the first nine months of 2022, the company reported operating cash flow of $11.4 billion. Therefore, adding gigafactory to new regions is unlikely to be a challenge from a financing perspective.Tesla is also known to be an innovator. Intense competition poses a challenge for the company. However, the innovation factor is likely to help Tesla in maintaining market leadership position.Pinterest (PINS)Pinterest logo. PINS stock.Source: Ink Drop / shutterstockIt might seem surprising that I am including Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) among stocks for investors over 30 to buy and hold. I however believe that PINS stock is undervalued and a quality e-commerce play with global presence.For Q3 2022, Pinterest reported revenue of $684.6 million. While revenue growth was 8% on a year-on-year basis, monthly active users were flat for the comparable period. Marginal revenue growth was therefore driven by an uptrend in average revenue per user.With Pinterest making the platform shipping friendly, it’s likely that advertising revenue will increase. This will boost the company’s ARPU in the coming years. Another point to note is that Pinterest reported cash and equivalents of $2.5 billion as of Q3 2022. Additionally, the company reported operating cash flow of $411 million for year-to-date 2022.With a strong balance sheet and the business having the potential to generate healthy cash flows, financial flexibility is robust. This will allow Pinterest to continue investing in product development and global expansion.Newmont Corporation (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockNewmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is a solid company and NEM stock offers investors a dividend yield of 5.0%. After a correction of almost 25% year to date, NEM stock is worth buying.Even with depressed gold prices, I don’t have any credit concerns for Newmont. The company has an investment-grade balance sheet with a net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDAX of 0.5. Strong cash flows and a total liquidity buffer of $6.7 billion will ensure dividends sustain along with steady investments.From an asset perspective, Newmont has proved reserves of 92.8 million ounces. With a robust reserve replacement, Newmont expects to sustain production well into the 2040s. This provides clear cash flow visibility even if gold trades around $2,000 an ounce in the next few years.Lucid Group (LCID)Closeup of the Lucid logo seen at a Lucid showroom in Millbrae, California. LCID stock.Source: Tada Images / ShutterstockLucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) is among the top growth stocks for investors over 30 to buy and hold.It’s true that Lucid has disappointed investors in 2022 with weak guidance. However, business development remains positive, and Lucid is investing in innovation.Lucid already has 34,000 reservations for its first model and it implies potential revenue of $3.2 billion. Further, the company has purchase commitments from the Saudi government for 100,000 electric vehicles.The model line-up for the next two years includes Lucid Air Sapphire and Project Gravity SUV. This will ensure that deliveries growth accelerates meaningfully. Once supply chain concerns ease, LCID stock is likely to trend higher.Cash burn in the next few years is unlikely to be a concern. Lucid is well positioned financially with cash and equivalents of $3.85 billion as of Q3 2022. This is sufficient to cover the cash burn through 2023. Recently, Lucid raised $1.5 billion in funding implying that it has ample liquidity through 2024.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Alexei Miller, the CEO of Gazprom, described the caps as ""a one-sided decision,"" per Reuters.""Such a one-sided decision is of course a violation of existing contracts, which would lead to a termination of supplies,"" Miller said on Russian state television, per Reuters.Miller's comments came a month after Russian President Vladimir Putin lashed out at the EU's natural gas price cap plans, calling them ""stupid."" He also threatened to cut off all energy supplies if price caps were imposed.""Will there be any political decisions that contradict the contracts? Yes, we just won't fulfil them. We will not supply anything at all if it contradicts our interests,"" Putin said on September 7, according to Reuters. ""We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil — we will not supply anything.""The US and EU have been moving away from Russian fuel since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. The US has already banned imports of Russian oil, while the EU has imposed an embargo on most imports of the fuel by the end of 2022. The EU — which imported some 40% of its natural gas from Russia last year — is also planning to cut its dependence on Russian natural gas.The moves aim to cut Russia's energy revenue, which funds the Ukraine war. Energy is a key pillar of Russia's economy, accounting for over one-fifth of its GDP.Story continuesGazprom has already halted deliveries via the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which was damaged by what's been widely considered an act of sabotage following leaks which were discovered on September 26. Russian gas deliveries to Europe have fallen by about half this year so far, Gazprom said on September 8.EU countries are preparing for a tough winter ahead due to the natural-gas crunch, with many turning to alternative heating sources like coal and firewood amid soaring energy prices.Benchmark Dutch natural-gas futures have more than doubled this year.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

India has also set 2070 as the deadline to become a net-zero, or carbon-neutral, nation.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatMore than half of India’s energy needs are already dependent on coal. These new projects are now likely to jeopardise India’s ambitious plans.Experts, too, have warned that a “lack of strategy” will slow down India’s progress on this front. “The biggest hurdle for India towards achieving net zero right now is the lack of a clear direction of moving away from fossil fuels...Which results in wrong investments in polluting technologies and would slow down the progress towards net zero as well as lead to stranded and non-performing assets,” Sunil Dahiya, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air analyst, had told Quartz in September.Does India really need new coal projects?In April and May this year, India witnessed a temporary but massive shortage of coal amid high demand for power. This triggered prime minister Narendra Modi’s government into planning new projects.The demand for coal, in any case, is expected to rise to 784.6 million tonnes for the financial year ending March 2023, according to research by Global Energy Monitor (GEM), a San Francisco-based NGO studying the global energy landscape.Indian finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, too, was explicit in her assessment yesterday (Oct. 16) about rising coal demand. She said, “...it’s not just India. Many countries have gone back. And coal is now going to be back again because I think gas cannot be afforded. Or it is not available as much as you want.”Story continuesThe price India will pay for its coal needsIndia’s 99 new coal projects will potentially put 165 villages and 87,630 families at risk of displacement. More than 41,000 of these families belong to the scheduled tribe category, noted GEM’s research.There’s also been criticism around India’s rush while existing coal projects remain underutilised.“On average, India’s coal mines use only two-thirds of the capacity with some large ones using only 1%,” GEM noted.]"

But no-one is immune from buying too high. For example, after five long years the Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) share price is a whole 61% lower. That's not a lot of fun for true believers. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 38%. The last week also saw the share price slip down another 23%.Since Wynn Resorts has shed US$1.9b from its value in the past 7 days, let's see if the longer term decline has been driven by the business' economics. See our latest analysis for Wynn Resorts Wynn Resorts wasn't profitable in the last twelve months, it is unlikely we'll see a strong correlation between its share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Arguably revenue is our next best option. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size.Over half a decade Wynn Resorts reduced its trailing twelve month revenue by 16% for each year. That puts it in an unattractive cohort, to put it mildly. Arguably, the market has responded appropriately to this business performance by sending the share price down 10% (annualized) in the same time period. We don't generally like to own companies that lose money and don't grow revenues. You might be better off spending your money on a leisure activity. You'd want to research this company pretty thoroughly before buying, it looks a bit too risky for us.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWynn Resorts is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?Investors should note that there's a difference between Wynn Resorts' total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price change, which we've covered above. The TSR attempts to capture the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested) as well as any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings offered to shareholders. Dividends have been really beneficial for Wynn Resorts shareholders, and that cash payout explains why its total shareholder loss of 58%, over the last 5 years, isn't as bad as the share price return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Wynn Resorts shareholders are down 38% for the year. Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 25%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 10% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Wynn Resorts better, we need to consider many other factors.

OUSA is managed by Alps. This particular fund, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the FTSE US Qual / Vol / Yield Factor 5% Capped Index.The OShares U.S. Quality Dividend Index measures the performance of publicly-listed large-capitalization and mid-capitalization dividend-paying issuers in the United States.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.With on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.48%.Story continuesSector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.OUSA's heaviest allocation is in the Healthcare sector, which is about 23.10% of the portfolio. Its Information Technology and Financials round out the top three.When you look at individual holdings, Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) accounts for about 5.84% of the fund's total assets, followed by Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (PG) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ).OUSA's top 10 holdings account for about 40.03% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskYear-to-date, the ALPS O'Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF has lost about -16.44% so far, and is down about -4.26% over the last 12 months (as of 10/17/2022).

77,b5b0d23e-5c2d-350b-bb6a-5a6a271e8ea1,JNJ,2022-10-17,3 Dow Stocks to Buy if You Are Feeling Greedy,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-dow-stocks-buy-feeling-214653950.html,1665697613,STORY,"['^DJI', 'MSFT', 'WBA', 'GE', 'JNJ']","[The Dow Jones Industrial Average gets too much credit as a barometer for the overall stock market. That job belongs to the S&amp;P 500. The Dow’s headline-grabbing swoons and rallies – “Dow Falls 1,200 Points” or “Dow Rallies 1,000 Points!” – pulls readers in. Often, these headlines then get investors to start wondering about the best Dow stocks to buy.Of course, the fact that these mega-cap stocks tend to move in higher point terms on a daily basis doesn’t really imply much. Rather, it’s the value these stocks display as very good long-term holdings that most investors ought to get excited about.That said, even the top Dow stocks many like don’t always pan out. Names like General Electric (NYSE:GE) immediately come to mind. However, many others like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the most successful companies in their respective industries.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that in mind, let’s look for a few Dow stocks to buy amid the current 2022 bear market.MSFTMicrosoft$234.24WBAWalgreens$33.65CRMSalesforce$145.44Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the strongest businesses in tech. This software company has built a moat so wide and deep that it should keep the competition at bay for decades to come.Microsoft dominates the enterprise business with its Office, Teams and Azure platforms. Inroads into gaming, social media (via LinkedIn) and other avenues only cement its lead at the top. As a result, Microsoft has put together a fortress balance sheet and a business that generates massive cash flows.While this fact may fly under the radar, investors may not realize that Microsoft’s operating margins are better than all other FAANG stocks.Better yet, consensus expectations call for 10% to 15% annual earnings and revenue growth through FY 2026. Combined with the fact that Microsoft trades at just 22-times this year’s earnings, this stock is hard to ignore.Story continuesThat said, for investors seeking deep value, let’s see if Microsoft stock tests the $210 to $215 area.Walgreens (WBA)Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comWalgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) isn’t a flawless stock by any means, hence the destruction we’ve seen in the stock price. Shares are down more than 45% from this decade’s high and are down more than 60% from its all-time high in 2015.That said, there are some attractive qualities to Walgreens.First, the stock pays out a 5.9% dividend yield, the third-highest yield in Dow. Second, shares trade at the insultingly low valuation of just 5.7-times this year’s earnings. For what it’s worth, Walgreens is forecast to generate 2% earnings growth on flat revenue growth this year.However, the bigger problem is next year, as consensus estimates call for a 9% dip in earnings despite 1% growth in revenue. The earnings dip could accelerate if the economy deteriorates further.But at what point do we overlook flat earnings growth this year and a sub-10% deceleration next year in lieu of a stock trading at 6.5-times earnings with a ~6% dividend yield? On top of that, the payout ratio of just 35% suggests the dividend should be rather secure.Steal Price: $23 to $26.Salesforce (CRM)A hand with pink painted fingernails holds a Salesforce sticker.Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.comLast but not least, we have Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). There are a number of stocks that could have gone in this slot and many of which are performing relatively well vs. the Dow and the S&amp;P 500. Salesforce is not one of those names, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t one of the Dow stocks to buy if we can get a steal of a deal.Shares have suffered a peak-to-trough decline of 55% amid this correction, and made new lows as recently as this week.Earlier this year, the company stated that broader economic pressures had not hurt its business. As of last quarter though, some of that pressure and a rising dollar finally caught up with Salesforce. Despite that, the company still delivered a top- and bottom-line beat with revenue growing 21.8% year over year.However, less than a month later, the company set a target of $50 billion in revenue for FY 2026 (vs. estimates of “just” $45 billion at the time). Keep in mind, Salesforce is already operating in FY 2023, while analysts expect 14% to 17% annual revenue growth from now until then.Steal Price: $115 to $125, with a preference toward the lower end of the range.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At MedtronicIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP &amp; President of Medical Surgical Portfolio, Robert White, sold US$737k worth of shares at a price of US$102 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$81.61). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Medtronic shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Medtronic insiders own 0.09% of the company, worth about US$100m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Medtronic Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Medtronic insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Medtronic insiders selling. Of course, the future is what matters most. So if you are interested in Medtronic, you should check out this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Medtronic may not be the best stock to buy.

80,bc252e94-6c54-3941-9674-bc29c28c0dfa,SWKS,2022-10-17,7 Under-the-Radar Retirement Stocks With 10% Upside Potential,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-under-radar-retirement-stocks-144934912.html,1665672574,STORY,"['SNA', 'SWKS', 'TSCO', 'DOX', 'RHI']","[With the world seemingly attempting to destroy itself, investors could use some under-the-radar retirement stocks. No, these ideas won’t make you rich. Instead, they’re more aligned with keeping your portfolio relatively safe through the storm. A combination of steady dividend payments and 10% upside potential by end of 2023 should make these ideas even more attractive.Of course, most folks arguably want the hottest tips on Wall Street. The problem with going through this approach is the broader context. Right now, the U.S. economy operates ambiguously amid the Federal Reserve’s hawkish monetary policy. Beyond our borders, the Ukraine crisis will probably drag on at least for the next several months. On top of all this, we have global recession fears.Under this framework, under-the-radar retirement stocks with 10% upside potential carries a premium. Below are some compelling ideas to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTSCOTractor Supply$196.59DOXAmdocs$78.84RHIRobert Half$79.64SAPSAP.$82.16SNASnap-on$206.55SWKSSkyworks Solutions$79.98SIMOSilicon Motion$58.42Tractor Supply (TSCO)IDEX stock: An electric tractor sits in a field on a sunny day with a wind turbine in the background.Source: Matthew Troke / Shutterstock.comA boring name but a necessity, Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) is an American retail chain of stores. Specifically, the company specializes in the home improvement, agriculture, lawn and garden maintenance, livestock and equine sectors. In addition, it provides pet care products for recreational farmers and ranchers, pet owners and landowners.By nature, Tractor Supply represents one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks to buy. However, on a technical basis, shares slipped nearly 14% on a year-to-date basis, providing a relative discount. In addition, Tractor Supply provides a forward yield of 1.83%. It’s not the greatest thing in the world but it’s something.Per Gurufocus.com, TSCO rates as a fairly valued investment. Based on its core attributes – strong three-year revenue growth rate and a highly profitable business – TSCO should gain a little over 10% by the end of 2023. Other factors to bolster Tractor Supply’s case is decent stability in the balance sheet. As well, the company features a return on equity of 53%, one of the highest metrics in the industry. Therefore, it’s a high-quality business.Story continuesRobert Half (RHI)An image of a businesswoman shaking hands with a female executive at a job interviewSource: ShutterstockAdmittedly, you’re probably not hearing too many great reports about staffing agency Robert Half (NYSE:RHI). With the labor market remaining tight, people who want jobs can get jobs. So, why bother with Robert Half? At the same time, this inquiry’s underlying sentiment makes RHI one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks.True, indicators such as the latest September jobs report does seem to suggest that employers hire like there’s no tomorrow. But tomorrow does exist. His name is Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Committed to cooling inflation, Powell seems ready to cool off the labor market, or at least uppercut it, if necessary. But under those circumstances, many folks will enter desperation mode. That’s why RHI represents one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks. It’s all about looking ahead.Fundamentally, Robert Half represents a full stack. First, it features a forward yield of 2.16%. Second, the company enjoys a robust balance sheet, solid growth and excellent profitability metrics. Based on its projected fair valuation trends, RHI should easily be up 10% by end of 2023.Amdocs (DOX)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comAmdocs (NASDAQ:DOX) specializes in software and services for communications, media and financial services providers and digital enterprises. Given the relevance of this industry, Amdocs achieved a rare feat in 2022. It’s up for the year, to the tune of 5.5%.Not discussed with much regularity, the lack of exposure makes DOX one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks to buy. For the income-seeking folks, Amdocs features a forward yield of 2%. Moreover, it boasts nine years of consecutive dividend increases. In contrast, the technology sector’s average yield sits at 1.37%. More importantly, Amdocs carries strong financial metrics. Anchored by a decently stable balance sheet, the company commands excellent income statement metrics. For instance, its three-year free cash flow (FCF) growth rate stands at 34.7%, beating out the industry median of 11.5%. As well, its net margin of 12.1% beats out nearly 82% of the competition.Based on prevailing valuation trajectories, DOX should gain close to 10% by end of 2023. However, if you can wait till the middle of 2024, DOX has a better chance of shining.SAP (SAP)SAP sign is seen at SAP SuccessFactors Global Headquarters in South San Francisco, CaliforniaSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comA business software giant, SAP (NYSE:SAP) undergirds the supply chain flow of several Global 500 companies. Of course, the problem right now is that with global supply chains snarled, SAP ironically struggled for relevance. For the year, shares slipped a staggering 42%, disheartening market participants.At the same time, the red ink makes for SAP being one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks. Indeed, the volatility represents a great time to consider the company’s myriad positives. For instance, it features a forward yield of 2.5%. Again, the technology sector’s average yield sits at 1.37%.Even better, Gurufocus.com rates SAP as significantly undervalued. Enjoying a decently stable balance sheet, SAP draws you toward its robust income statement. For example, the company features a three-year FCF growth rate of 24.5%, besting 66% of the competition. On the bottom line, SAP has a net margin of 13.4%, superior to more than 83% of the industry. As well, SAP features a high-quality business, with a return on equity of 10.6%. However, investors may need to be a little patient with this one. Fundamentally, it’s on track to be up 3% by end of 2023. By end of 2024, it could be near 10% up.Snap-on (SNA)retirement stocks: miniature figurines climb a staircase made of coinsSource: ShutterstockTied to the industrial products industry, Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) enjoys everyday relevance. Manufacturing and marketing high-end tools and equipment for professional use in the transportation industry, the company is a staple among the automotive, marine, aviation and railroad industries. Following the close of the Oct. 12 session, SNA is down 2.6% for the year. That’s not bad considering the wider circumstances.SNA brings plenty of goodies to the table among under-the-radar retirement stocks. For one thing, the company carries a forward yield of 2.73%. In contrast, the consumer discretionary average yield is 1.9%. On the financials, Snap-on commands significant strengths across the board.On the company’s balance sheet, it features an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.63. This compares to the industry median of 0.54. Regarding income, Snap-on has a three-year book growth rate of 12%, beating out nearly 71% of the competition. Its return on equity stands at a stout 20.8%, reflecting a high-quality business.Based on valuation trajectories, SNA may be up 5% by the end of 2023. However, if sentiment moves toward Snap-on’s stable business, shares have a solid shot at 10% up.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) manufactures semiconductors for use in radio frequency and mobile communications systems. Because of this specialty, Skyworks commands significant relevance toward the 5G rollout. Essentially, the company undergirds the latest innovation in wireless connectivity, thereby making it one of the more compelling under-the-radar retirement stocks to buy.While SWKS represents a known commodity, not too many folks want to touch it right now; hence its in-the-shadows profile. Since the start of this year, Skyworks tanked over 50% of equity value. However, the company could make for an interesting long-term idea for patient, volatility-tolerating investors. Notably, Skyworks provides a forward yield of 3.12%. It also features eight years of consecutive dividend increases.Though the losses for SWKS are glaring, it might be a mistake to focus too much on this distraction. Per Gurufocus.com, SKWS is significantly undervalued. In addition, Skyworks enjoys a stable balance sheet and robust growth. Moreover, with a return on equity of nearly 25% (among the upper echelon in the industry), Skyworks represents a high-quality business.Based on valuation trajectories, SWKS has a solid chance of breaking into double-digit territory sometime in 2024. Fundamentally, the company is tied in with one of the most enticing growth sectors in 5G.Silicon Motion (SIMO)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockSilicon Motion (NASDAQ:SIMO) carries significant risks. It develops NAND flash controller integrated circuits for solid-state storage devices. However, because of the supply chain disruptions in the semiconductor space, along with regional geopolitical tensions, SIMO is volatile.Since the beginning of this year, SIMO stock dropped nearly 39% of equity value. In the trailing month, it’s down 19%, reflecting ever-worsening volatility. At the same time, once the selloff fades, SIMO could be intriguing. For instance, the company features a forward yield of 3.12%. As well, it enjoys eight years of dividend increases.Now, another risk factor to consider. Gurufocus.com labels SIMO as a possible value trap, a warning that shouldn’t go ignored. However, it’s also fair to point out that the company enjoys strengths across the financial spectrum. This includes excellent growth and profitability metrics. In addition, its balance sheet carries no long-term debt.With recent volatility, it’s a bit difficult to predict where SIMO may go. However, based on valuation trends, SIMO can easily hit 10% up by the end of 2024 if circumstances in the broader semiconductor space improves.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

NKE tumbled after it released its quarterly results on September 29 as is warned Wall Street that soaring inventory would eat away at its profit margins. The sportswear titan, like many others, is struggling to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to consumer demand amid ongoing supply chain bottlenecks.Nike’s post-earnings release drop is part of a much longer downturn that’s seen NKE shares sink 44% in the past 12 months alongside many other consumer discretionary stocks.   Nike’s StoryNike remains one of the heavyweight champions of sportswear. The company has continued to adapt and create trends to help fend off improved challenges from Adidas, Lululemon LULU, and many smaller digital-native brands.The iconic Swoosh is attached to many of the most popular sports, athletes, and cultural icons on the planet. This helps Nike stand out as one of the most valuable brands, alongside the likes of Coca-Cola and Apple.Nike continues to invest in its future through multiple shopping apps and its massive, wide-ranging digital marketplace. Nike is all-in on its own e-commerce and direct-to-consumer offerings, having cut ties with many retailers, all of which are great for margins and maintaining its brand cachet.That said, it’s facing a rough near-term outlook as it continues to find it difficult to navigate the rocky supply chain ecosystem and it’s getting crushed by the strong U.S. dollar. Plus, Nike is finding it somewhat of a challenge to adapt to rapidly changing shopping patterns as more consumers tighten their purse strings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNike’s Q1 FY23 (recently-reported quarter) revenue popped by nearly 4% and 10% on a currency-neutral basis. The company direct-to-consumer segments continue to fuel sales growth. Despite its top-line expansion, the firm’s adjusted earnings tumbled 20% YoY as higher costs and surging inventory levels took a chunk out of its profits.Nike said that its inventories soared 44% to $9.7 billion in the latest quarter, “driven by volatility in transit times in North America, strategic decisions to buy inventory for future seasons earlier, and lower inventory levels due to last year's factory closures in Vietnam and Indonesia.”Story continuesBottom LineNike’s consensus earnings estimates have crumbled recently to help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). NKE’s Shoes and Retail Apparel industry is also in the bottom third of over 250 Zacks industries. And it lands “F” grades for Value and Momentum in our Style Scores system.Nike’s 1.4% dividend yield is nothing to write home about and it’s still not “cheap” in terms of forward earnings. And Nike is being forced to mark down its offerings heading into the vital holiday shopping season.  Zacks estimates call for Nike’s adjusted FY23 earnings to slide 17% to $3.13 per share on 5% stronger sales. The company is then set to post 9% sales growth the following year and 27% higher earnings to climb above its FY22 levels.The long-term bullish case for Nike is somewhat firmly intact. Yet, investors might want to stay away from the stock for now given all of the economic uncertainty and inventory setbacks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Rather, it was the matter-of-fact tone around potentially moving interest rates to the 4.5% to 5% range and the stickiness of inflation.I have been struck by the tone of the economy elsewhere, too.I just spoke at length with Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus. Mr. Marcus may be a 93-year-old billionaire, but by no means is he mailing it in.Marcus remains very active in helping small businesses, is plugged into all things politics (yes, he was a Trump supporter), and keeps a close eye on how Home Depot is performing. Marcus flat-out told me that inflation is going to crush the economy and that regulations are strangling small businesses.Even adjusting for Marcus' political leanings, it was striking to hear that tone about the economy from a business leader.And then, I wake up at 4 am on Saturday and find these comments on the economy from Jefferies Chief Economist Aneta Markowska:""After a ’stronger for longer‘ expansion, we envision a recession that comes later than consensus currently expects but hits the economy much harder than anticipated. Consensus expects a mild recession starting in Q1 and lasting about 3 quarters. We believe it will start later (around Q3) and last longer (5 quarters).""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Aneta isn't one of those fear-mongering newsletter hawkers.

After enjoying the freedoms of gig life, corporate employees simply don’t want to return to business as usual. What’s more, 40% of respondents in a Reli Exchange revealed that if they faced termination for their refusal to return to the office, they would instead start their own business.Thus, we have two paradigm shifts that bolster gig economy stocks. First, a radical telecommuting transition materialized in early 2020. Second, more people now consider entrepreneurialism as a viable career path. And essentially, that’s what the gig economy is: independent contractors branching out on their own.What’s more, experts project that this segment will continue to expand. By 2023, analysts anticipate that the projected gross volume of the gig economy is expected to reach $455.2 billion. Therefore, simply by logical deduction, gig economy stocks should explode next year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBetter yet, this market sector features diverse opportunities. It’s not just about freelance marketplaces, though that’s always an option. Instead, companies providing the tools and platforms for success may enjoy a significant upside. Below are the gig economy stocks to put on your radar.INTUIntuit$388.06HRBH&amp;R Block$38.75MSFTMicrosoft$225.75PYPLPayPal$83.81UPWKUpwork$13.32ROVRRover$3.87ADBEAdobe$286.15Intuit (INTU)Intuit and turbotax logo on a phone screen on top of a keyboard. INTU stock.Source: Julio Ricco / ShutterstockIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) might not intuitively rank among the gig economy stocks as a tax software provider. That is until you realize that taxes for independent contractors – colloquially referred to as 1099 workers – present significant differences from W2 employees.While it’s possible to write volumes on this subject, the gist of the matter is that gig workers are in business for themselves. Therefore, their taxes run similarly to corporate taxes. Rather than working for a salary, gig workers generate revenue and hopefully earn net income. From there, these 1099 workers can deduct legally allowed expenses from their gross income to whittle down their tax obligations.Story continuesOn the other hand, W2 employees whose sole income stems from their jobs have an easy tax-filing process. That’s why so many platforms offer free W2 services – it doesn’t take much skill to file these things.However, the opposite is true for 1099 folks. Therefore, Intuit’s tax-prep software should be in great demand in 2023 and beyond, making INTU one of the gig economy stocks to buy.H&amp;R Block (HRB)Image of a yellow building featuring the H&amp;R Block (HRB) logoSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comOne of the companies I’ve been pounding the table on recently, H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB), finally made good on its potential in 2022. Since the January opener, HRB gained about 58%, making it a scorcher. Remember that the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index fell around 25% during the same period.At the same time, the massive jump makes HRB risky relative to other gig economy stocks. For instance, in the trailing month, shares fell over 15%. Fundamentally, I suspect people cashing out of cryptos led to greater demand for H&amp;R Block. Due to cryptos’ novelty, this asset class’s taxation presents enormous complexities. Cynically, that’s a positive for HRB.While the enthusiasm was probably most significant for the tax year 2021, it’s also possible that H&amp;R Block will see a boon next year as well. That’s because many folks probably panicked this year. In addition, the company may provide excellent guidance for handling capital losses.While you may want to wait a bit for the volatility in HRB to die down, fundamental circumstances should improve. If so, it represents one of the gig economy stocks to buy.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comPerhaps best known as an all-around consumer technology giant, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) represents one of the most critical gig economy stocks. Mainly, I’m referring to its Software as a Service platform featuring myriad utilitarian applications like Word and Excel. When it comes to the language of business, gig workers need to be fluent in Microsoft.Frankly, if you don’t know these programs, you will not get very far in the gig economy.Based on the latest data, Microsoft Windows owns 75% of the desktop operating system market. Cynically, this should keep MSFT humming as one of the gig economy stocks to buy. True, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) symbolizes sizable competition at nearly 15% market share. But again, lacking familiarity with the Microsoft ecosystem is fatal in the business world.Plus, according to Gurufocus.com, MSFT ranks as modestly undervalued. Featuring financial strengths across the board, Microsoft is a good pick-up, especially with shares down 33% year-to-date.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comWhile Microsoft is a non-starter in terms of gig success, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) helps transition folks into the paradigm of the 1099 ecosystem. Unlike being a corporate employee, you don’t punch a clock in the gig economy. Nor do you have a paycheck coming in automatically every two weeks.Instead, you’ve got to present a sterling reputation to prospective clients (not employers). Otherwise, you’re not going to be winning many contracts. Moreover, you’ve got to generate your own invoices and submit them accordingly. And if circumstances go awry in this arena, it’s up to you to seek a resolution. Plenty of responsibilities exist, which can be initially overwhelming. Thankfully, PayPal’s financial technology (fintech) platform offers intuitive operations.I’m not going to claim to be a PayPal expert but in short, it acts as a self-employment portal. Not only do you essentially have a digital bank account, but you can also invoice and receive payment through the platform, all the while having the associated “paperwork” neatly organized.You really have to join the gig life to understand the true beauty of PayPal. But when you do, you’ll see why it’s one of the gig economy stocks to buy.Upwork (UPWK)upwork (UPWK) logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Santa Clara and San Francisco, California, Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) represents a freelancing platform. Essentially, Upwork connects professional talent with enterprises seeking specific gaps to fill. Fundamentally, UPWK is a direct play among gig economy stocks. That said, such a framework hasn’t been exceptionally positive.For instance, since the start of this year, UPWK stock has hemorrhaged over 60% of market value. That’s exceptionally steep, far more than the heavy-hit Nasdaq Composite, which dropped 34% during the same period. However, it’s also fair to point out that contrarians might view UPWK as a potential upside opportunity.Per Gurufocus.com, Upwork’s business is significantly undervalued. But even here, prospective investors should note that they must exercise patience. Yes, in the second quarter of 2022, Upwork generated nearly $157 million in revenue, up 26% against the year-ago period. However, net losses in the most recent quarter came out to $23.8 million versus a loss of $16.5 million one year ago.Still, with more people eager to consider making the pivot to the gig life, UPWK could be one of the gig economy stocks to buy.Rover (ROVR)The logo for Rover displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comFor those folks that want a unique take on gig economy stocks, Rover (NASDAQ:ROVR) may provide just that. Similar to Upwork, Rover connects service providers with service seekers. But in Rover’s case, the focus centres on pet care services. Mainly, this involves dog walking but could also incorporate other offerings like pet sitting and boarding.Fundamentally, Rover benefits strongly from America’s love for its pets. According to the American Pet Products Association, in 2021, consumers spent $123.6 billion on pets and related products and services. What’s more, every year since at least 2018, the total revenue of this industry has increased significantly.However, ROVR hasn’t exactly benefitted from the trend. Since the start of 2022, ROVR stock has tanked over 62% of its equity value. However, as society gradually normalizes – and especially if the return-to-the-office movement succeeds – 2023 could be a banner year for pet service providers. Therefore, it’s worth keeping ROVR on your radar for gig economy stocks to buAdobe (ADBE)Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.Source: Tattoboo / ShutterstockOne of the software giants, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), specializes in various applications. However, it’s probably best known for its Photoshop program. Much like Microsoft represents a must-have in the business world, Adobe is vital for creatives. But will this alone make it a solid buy among gig economy stocks? It turns out the answer is a surprising yes.While the creative industry carries a reputation for being a soft – and thereby lesser – skill, nothing could be further from the truth. Without getting bogged down into various statistics, just do a thought experiment: how successful will your startup be if your logo looked like it was drawn by a monkey with a paintbrush in its mouth? Creatives can be the difference between getting the critical contract and not.Now, if you really want hard data, take a look at this. “Fifty-nine percent of animators, art directors, painters, and illustrators are self-employed, according to BLS. That number is even higher for writers (64 percent) and photographers (68 percent).” It may not seem like it at first, but ADBE is a hidden opportunity among gig economy stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for International Business Machines How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for International Business Machines is:29% = US$5.6b ÷ US$19b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.29 in profit.Does International Business Machines Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, International Business Machines has a superior ROE than the average (17%) in the IT industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for International Business Machines.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesInternational Business Machines' Debt And Its 29% ROEInternational Business Machines clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.58. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

93,11d3ae12-5ca3-3a4d-aa71-cb0e1b6779fd,TAP,2022-10-17,Here's What To Make Of Molson Coors Beverage's (NYSE:TAP) Decelerating Rates Of Return,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-molson-coors-beverages-nyse-102947665.html,1666002587,STORY,['TAP-A'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Although, when we looked at Molson Coors Beverage (NYSE:TAP), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Molson Coors Beverage, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.047 = US$1.1b ÷ (US$27b - US$3.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Thus, Molson Coors Beverage has an ROCE of 4.7%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Beverage industry average of 13%. See our latest analysis for Molson Coors Beverage roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Molson Coors Beverage compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEThere hasn't been much to report for Molson Coors Beverage's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Molson Coors Beverage to be a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why Molson Coors Beverage is paying out 36% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Molson Coors Beverage's ROCEWe can conclude that in regards to Molson Coors Beverage's returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. And in the last five years, the stock has given away 34% so the market doesn't look too hopeful on these trends strengthening any time soon. All in all, the inherent trends aren't typical of multi-baggers, so if that's what you're after, we think you might have more luck elsewhere.One more thing to note, we've identified   2 warning signs  with Molson Coors Beverage and understanding these should be part of your investment process.While Molson Coors Beverage isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Read this and more market news on the go with Yahoo Finance App.""Damn, this is going be a tough few more months for the economy and markets.""That's what I was thinking as our very Jennifer Schonberger chatted exclusively on Friday with San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly.It's not that Daly provided anything markets haven't heard elsewhere from Fed officials in recent months. Rather, it was the matter-of-fact tone around potentially moving interest rates to the 4.5% to 5% range and the stickiness of inflation.I have been struck by the tone of the economy elsewhere, too.I just spoke at length with Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus. Mr. Marcus may be a 93-year-old billionaire, but by no means is he mailing it in.Marcus remains very active in helping small businesses, is plugged into all things politics (yes, he was a Trump supporter), and keeps a close eye on how Home Depot is performing. Marcus flat-out told me that inflation is going to crush the economy and that regulations are strangling small businesses.Even adjusting for Marcus' political leanings, it was striking to hear that tone about the economy from a business leader.And then, I wake up at 4 am on Saturday and find these comments on the economy from Jefferies Chief Economist Aneta Markowska:""After a ’stronger for longer‘ expansion, we envision a recession that comes later than consensus currently expects but hits the economy much harder than anticipated. Consensus expects a mild recession starting in Q1 and lasting about 3 quarters.

95,bd1ce7cd-0f4a-326c-81f1-4fd4398e6fab,GM,2022-10-17,General Motors’ Bolt Jolt Should Rev Up GM Stock,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-motors-bolt-jolt-rev-153946811.html,1665675586,STORY,['GM'],"[American automotive giant General Motors (NYSE:GM) has had a challenging year, to say the least. Like many other car manufacturers, General Motors has struggled with supply-chain disruptions. The good news is that the company sees some improvement in its inventory-related issues. Furthermore, GM stock should be glad to know that General Motors is selling certain electric vehicle (EV) models at a record pace.In some ways, General Motors is a barometer of the health of the U.S. automotive sector in general. If good old General Motors is having problems, it’s probably reflective of all American automakers’ struggles.So, it’s troubling to see this iconic car and truck manufacturer lose potential revenue due to supply-chain constraints. There may be hope on the horizon, though — and in the global transition to EVs, General Motors is already starting to look like a winner.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhat’s Happening With GM Stock?Suffice it to say that inventory issues have made it difficult for General Motors to thrive in 2022, and this has been reflected in a sagging GM stock price. From early January to early October, General Motors shares practically lost half of their value.As the Wall Street Journal explained, the automotive industry has dealt with “choppy factory schedules and thin dealership stocks, stemming from semiconductor shortages and other supply problems.” Thankfully, a third-quarter 2022 update from General Motors offers a ray of hope.The company’s update acknowledged that Covid-19-related supply-chain disruptions “impacted production” in 2021’s third quarter. Fast forward to Q3 of 2022, though, and General Motors observed “modestly improving” inventory during the quarter.Plus, the company had data points to back this up. In particular, General Motors ended Q3 with 359,292 vehicles in its dealer inventory. That’s a huge improvement over 111,453 vehicles during the previous quarter, and it’s “nearly three times the inventory available” compared to the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesGeneral Motors’ EVs Are Selling QuicklyIt’s also encouraging to see that General Motors sold its Bolt EV and Bolt EUV (the SUV version of the Bolt) at a record pace during Q3 2022. Between these two EV models, General Motors sold 14,709 total units during the quarter.This could just be the beginning, as General Motors described “unprecedented customer demand” for these EV models. In response, the automaker plans to ramp up its calendar-year global production for these EV models from around 44,000 units in 2022, to over 70,000 in 2023.To facilitate this objective, General Motors made its EV models surprisingly affordable. The base manufacturers’ suggested retail price (MSRP) for the 2023 Chevrolet Bolt EV currently starts at $25,600. Meanwhile, the Bolt EUV starts at just $27,200.What You Can Do NowAs you can see, General Motors isn’t immune to widespread supply-chain disruptions. It’s a problem that has weighed on GM stock this year.However, General Motors’ third-quarter update has notable bright spots. A “modest” improvement in the automaker’s inventory offers hope for a turnaround. Besides, General Motors’ Bolt sales are on the rise. Therefore, traders ought to seriously consider taking a long-term position in General Motors shares.On the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.David Moadel has provided compelling content – and crossed the occasional line – on behalf of Motley Fool, Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, TipRanks, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

Read this and more market news on the go with Yahoo Finance App.""Damn, this is going be a tough few more months for the economy and markets.""That's what I was thinking as our very Jennifer Schonberger chatted exclusively on Friday with San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly.It's not that Daly provided anything markets haven't heard elsewhere from Fed officials in recent months. Rather, it was the matter-of-fact tone around potentially moving interest rates to the 4.5% to 5% range and the stickiness of inflation.I have been struck by the tone of the economy elsewhere, too.I just spoke at length with Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus. Mr. Marcus may be a 93-year-old billionaire, but by no means is he mailing it in.Marcus remains very active in helping small businesses, is plugged into all things politics (yes, he was a Trump supporter), and keeps a close eye on how Home Depot is performing. Marcus flat-out told me that inflation is going to crush the economy and that regulations are strangling small businesses.Even adjusting for Marcus' political leanings, it was striking to hear that tone about the economy from a business leader.And then, I wake up at 4 am on Saturday and find these comments on the economy from Jefferies Chief Economist Aneta Markowska:""After a ’stronger for longer‘ expansion, we envision a recession that comes later than consensus currently expects but hits the economy much harder than anticipated. Consensus expects a mild recession starting in Q1 and lasting about 3 quarters. We believe it will start later (around Q3) and last longer (5 quarters).""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Aneta isn't one of those fear-mongering newsletter hawkers. She is one of the best in the game at what she does. So to hear this super negative tone on the economic outlook surprised me.Story continuesAll of this brings me to today and the 9th Annual Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit, which airs live all day on yahoofinance.com, YouTube, Roku, our lovely app, and elsewhere.

97,8ea0bfc9-7004-4e22-8e09-87ab1ca14187,TGT,2022-10-17,Tupperware parties are here to stay as part omni-channel approach: CEO,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tupperware-parties-stay-as-part-omni-channel-approach-to-gain-brand-relevance-ceo-144041302.html,1665931241,STORY,"['TUP', 'TCS', 'NWL', 'TGT']","[Tupperware (TUP) containers may be available in Target now, but the 76-year old brand also plans to keep its original strategy — independent sales reps and home sales parties (though now you don't need an invite — you can find a local seller on the company website).As part of an omni-channel approach to take the brand into the next generation and gain brand relevance, the parties will stay, CEO Miguel Fernandez told Yahoo Finance.""Our direct selling channel and our Tupperware parties are going to continue to be there ... Are they going to change?... I think they will because, obviously, we have technology.""Fernandez says many customers now use video demonstrations to see products and attend e-parties in addition to in-person events, particularly in South America.""What we're seeing in many of our developed countries are more and more parties, what we call e-parties, which is people that host consumers, and they have these communities around the screen, so a combination of both [in-person and online],"" he explained.In the company's most recent quarterly earnings report, total net sales came in at $340.4 million, a decrease of 18%, yet boosted by the strength of South America, particularly from recruitment and retention efforts. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, sales in South America increased 13% from the year prior.""In some parts of the world like Latin America and some parts of Asia, direct selling is a very relevant channel,"" Fernandez told Yahoo Finance. ""We're going to be investing 99% of our resources into making our core business, which is direct selling, even better and better in those countries.""In-person parties aren't nearly as popular in the U.S. market, however.""Some other countries like Western Europe or the U.S., we understand the consumers moved, or some other consumers move from direct selling into e-commerce or retail and that's where we want to be, "" Fernandez said.Story continuesTarget will hold ""only 20, 25 SKUs (stock keeping units),"" while Tupperware over all carries over 200 SKUs every single month on its site.""Once we start competing like any other consumer brand in the shelves or in the screen of the major retailers, then we're going to be considered like any other CPG company and our performance is going to be judged by our performance of the numbers,"" he noted.Though the stock is under pressure, down nearly 40% compared to two years ago and down more than 71% year-over-year, Fernandez seemed optimistic about the retail approach to help boost returns and compete against the likes of Rubbermaid, The Container Store, KitchenAid and other companies that sell food storage containers.Fernandez joined the company in April of 2020 from Avon, where he led a transformation strategy, and hopes to do the same at Tupperware.""The most important thing about the brand is that, let's face it, it was a little bit dated and it was dated because we were reaching just a certain amount of consumers. What we're trying to do right now is to gain brand relevance and to be where the new consumers are, where the new people are, and wherever they are.""Tupperware items, including a set of ""retro"" storage containers at left, rest on a table during a Tupperware party in Sebastian, Florida, on Wednesday, May 18, 2022. A curated selection of Tupperware offerings became available at Target stores and Target.com, CEO Miguel Fernandez revealed in a post on Linkedin. (Stephen M.

99,72f14eb4-a335-3aba-a7b2-aef5f8e20392,CSX,2022-10-17,7 Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-nasdaq-stocks-buy-hold-202653207.html,1665694853,STORY,"['NDAQ', 'TXN', 'GOOGL', 'PEP', 'BRKR', 'SBUX']","[The Nasdaq is known for high-flying growth stocks, not necessarily buy-and-hold candidates. Electric vehicles, biotechnology, social networking stocks, cloud software companies and the like. These are the sort of companies that can go up five- or 10-fold if their businesses find sustained market success. On the other hand, their stocks can easily end up losing most of their value if anything goes wrong and/or there is a broader correction in the tech sector.Over the past year, the Nasdaq is down 33.5%, with many of the individual components suffering far greater losses as investors refocused their attention from future growth to current profits and cash flows. It feels as though investors are hyper-focused on short-term losses rather than long-term potential, such as where a company may be in, say, 2030.On the bright side, this year’s bear market has created some stellar opportunities for long-term investors looking for Nasdaq stocks to buy and hold. Below are seven of them.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTXNTexas Instruments$168.11JDJD.com$45.49IBKRInteractive Brokers$80.10PEPPepsiCo$180.71CEGConstellation Energy$87.54CSXCSX Corporation$29.98IDXXIDEXX Laboratories$382.90Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold: Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is an analog semiconductor company. Analog semiconductors are vital because they turn real-world information such as weather conditions into data. The ability to sense and process external information is crucial for enabling cutting-edge technologies such as autonomous driving, remote monitoring and internet of things applications.Semiconductor shortages in 2021 led to high prices and record profits across the industry. The boom has turned into a bust this year, however, as demand for consumer electronics such as televisions and laptops has dropped significantly from peak 2021 levels. Texas Instruments has been able to sidestep much of this cyclical pain, though, since its analog chips tend to go into slower-moving industrial markets rather than hot consumer products.Story continuesTexas Instruments is also a cash flow machine. Management is laser-focused on the metric, noting in a recent presentation: “We believe that growth of free cash flow per share is the primary driver of long-term value.”This focus has worked out well for shareholders. Over the past 10 years, TXN stock has averaged a 20.6% return and it offers a 3.1% dividend yield.JD.com (JD)JD.com (JD) logo displayed at the entrance to the company's Silicon Valley office.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comChinese tech stocks have been an abject failure over the past year. Investors have lost a ton of money in the sector, and many traders have understandably thrown in the towel. Obviously, Chinese securities carry elevated political and financial risks right now.That said, China still has more than a billion people and most of them are going to shop online. JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is one of the country’s most promising e-commerce services. It has built a reputation for higher product quality standards than its rivals, which has been a big selling point in a market that has a problem with knock-off and counterfeit goods. In addition, JD has invested heavily in logistics, which has powered fast and reliable delivery schedules.JD stock is now down nearly 60% from its 2021 peak. This has left shares trading at just 16 times forward earnings. Meanwhile, the company’s market capitalization is down to $71 billion. That’s a pretty small figure for a company whose annual sales are expected to top $170 billion in 2023.As long as Chinese stocks as a group remain available to American investors, JD stock should be one of the leaders in its category.Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold: Interactive Brokers (IBKR)A concept image showing hands holding a globe with stock charts in the background.Source: ShutterstockInteractive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) is a leading discount brokerage firm. The company services a wide variety of customers ranging from small retail accounts to registered financial advisors to hedge funds. Interactive Brokers has a global reach, offering services to investors in dozens of countries. It also offers a vast array of tradable markets, including Europe, Asia, and even emerging markets such as Mexico, which are all available within a single trading account.The firm is set to benefit dramatically from higher interest rates. For starters, it gets to charge much higher interest rates on margin loans thanks to rising rates. The cost of a U.S. dollar margin loan has gone up from 1.6% to 5.3% at Interactive in recent months thanks to the ongoing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Additionally, volatile markets tend to lead to more trading activity, which can boost profitability.IBRK stock isn’t just a near-term interest rate play, however. The company has long-term appeal. Founder Thomas Peterffy is a visionary within the brokerage services industry and has built his company to thrive on a generational timeframe. In addition, the company’s focus on low costs and excellent trading execution has led to the firm having a stellar reputation with professional traders. As the brokerage industry continues to consolidate, Interactive should be one of the biggest winners.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comIf you look through a list of Nasdaq stocks, there are a surprisingly high number of firms that have nothing to do with technology. Take PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), for example. The soft drink and snack foods maker is one of the safest and most reliable blue chip stocks listed on the Nasdaq.PepsiCo will rarely wow investors with an amazing performance in any given year. Over time, however, the company’s shares have steadily marched upward, with an average annual return of 12% over the past decade. The company is also a dividend machine. It has increased its annual dividend for 50 years in a row, putting it among the elite Dividend Kings.Some investors might be put off by the fact that PEP stock is trading at nearly 25 times forward earnings. That’s fairly expensive, especially in a bear market. However, shares are worth the price, especially for long-term investors. Pepsico delivers reliable earnings year in and year out, and it pays investors an increasingly large dividend as well.Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold: Constellation Energy (CEG)Source: ShutterstockPower utility Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG) is another quality, sleep-well-at-night Nasdaq stock. The firm is one of the larger publicly traded electricity utilities with a market capitalization of nearly $30 billion.The company’s claim to fame is its large capacity for nuclear power generation. Nuclear power had been viewed as a fading asset in recent years due to high costs, regulatory pushback and a preference for other renewables. However, solar and wind have run into some pricing and capacity issues of their own. Meanwhile, the world is facing severe electricity generation issues in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.This has created something of a nuclear renaissance. Expect more research, investment, subsidies, and so on to go into nuclear going forward as policymakers increasingly look to nuclear as a “bridge” capacity generator between fossil fuels and green renewables. The Inflation Reduction Act, for example, provided significant subsidies to carbon-free power production, which includes nuclear.Constellation shares just started trading in early 2022, as it was spun off from another power utility. Shares are up more than 130% since then. Expect CEG stock to continue rallying as more investors discover this unique clean energy utility.CSX Corporation (CSX)Is It Time for Investors to Get On Board CSX Stock?Source: ShutterstockRailroad operator CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) is another firm that most people probably didn’t realize was on the Nasdaq. Railroads are an interesting asset class. They were the original American growth stocks. American railroad booms led to several bouts of market euphoria in the 1800s. Over a long enough time horizon, however, every new technology becomes a commodity product.Railroads have enjoyed a revival in recent years. Much of this is due to rising fuel prices. They have much better per-mile efficiency than trucks, which is a key consideration given soaring fuel prices. Also, there has been considerable progress in electrifying and automating rail transport. This improves economics for the industry while lowering its environmental footprint.Make no mistake about it, 2023 is going to be a rough year for railroads, including CSX. We’re likely to see big drops in sales of consumer durable goods such as appliances, building materials, automobiles, and so on. This means less cargo business for the rails. Over the longer-term, however, railroads are the best way to move large amounts of goods around, and operators like CSX have great profit margins thanks to local monopolies in many of the markets they serve.After a 20% decline this year, CSX stock now trades for just 15 times forward earnings.Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX)vet looking at a dog's xray to represent pet stocks like IDXXSource: ShutterstockIdexx Laboratories (NASDAQ:IDXX) is a life sciences company focused on animal health. It primarily offers solutions for companion animals, i.e., pets. Idexx has three main lines of business. It distributes in-clinic testing and screening products that veterinarians can use in their offices. It has a testing service where pet owners and vets can send samples to a network of Idexx-affiliated laboratories for processing. And there’s Idexx’s software business, which offers patient and practice management and client outreach for veterinarian offices.IDXX stock was one of the past decade’s unheralded winners. Shares soared more than 1,000% between 2012 and 2021. In 2022, Idexx has fallen by nearly 42%. However, the same factors that powered the stock’s 10-fold rally over the past decade persist. Namely, people are increasingly viewing their pets as family. As folks have tended to have fewer kids in recent years, it has freed up more money and attention for animal companions. The pandemic accelerated this trend as people were stuck at home and looking for company.IDXX stock sold off as the pandemic-induced animal adoption boom came to an end. But the longer-term trend hasn’t changed, and shares will be back to full health in due time.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in TXN stock.

Realtor.com® today introduced a real life house whisperer – here to help homebuyers navigate the tricky process with his uncanny ability to communicate with houses. Born and raised in houses, this hero can solve any home buying conundrum and is a new, trusted voice to help tell Realtor.com®'s brand story.Raised in houses, this hero can help struggling homebuyers whenever and wherever he's neededDeveloped in collaboration with Erich &amp; Kallman, the creative campaign embodies Realtor.com®'s tagline ""To Each Their Home"" beginning with a four spot TV campaign and continuing online across digital channels.

With digital campaign extensions, the traveling house whisperer could show up anywhere he's needed, across the world wide web.While the new campaign is light-hearted, it comes at a time when the housing market is rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly challenging. Mortgage rates are at levels not seen in 20 years and home prices are hovering at all-time highs, adding hundreds of dollars to monthly payments. Home shoppers aren't sure where to turn, especially those looking to purchase their first home.

Armed with his housing market wisdom and the Realtor.com® app, he helps demystify the homebuying process.Eric Kallman, co-founder and Chief Creative Officer at Erich and Kallman said, ""The homebuying process can be an emotional roller coaster and homebuyers are dealing with a lot of noise. Realtor.com® is a trusted and reliable source that you can turn to for impartial guidance, but we needed some help from a standout spokesperson in order to illustrate that in a memorable way. The knowledgeable house whisperer is a straight-talking, sage guru who cements Realtor.com® in people's minds as the transparent guide you can trust to give you the real picture of the real estate process.""In the first spot, So Many Houses, a family is overwhelmed by the sheer number of homes to choose from. The Realtor.com® house whisperer appears out of nowhere in their living room. He shows the family how to use the Realtor.com® app's detailed filters to narrow down their options to just the ones that work for their family.In the second spot, House Bitten, we learn about the Realtor.com® house whisperer's origin – when he was bitten by a house as a child. Lucky for the family struggling to understand how much home they can afford, the ever-helpful house whisperer shows them the Buying Power tool on Realtor.com® – so their young child no longer has to get a job to help pay for the new house.Creative Credits: Realtor.com®Mickey Neuberger, Chief Marketing OfficerNuno Ferreira, SVP Brand &amp; Executive Creative DirectorCharlie Quirk, Director of Brand StrategyBrent Wollack, Associate Creative DirectorWendy Hernandez, Sr. Brand Strategy ManagerErich and KallmanSteven Erich, Founder/PresidentEric Kallman, Founder/Chief Creative OfficerRikesh Lal, Executive Creative DirectorAlyssa Trocina, Art DirectorAaron Hirsch, CopywriterKati Haberstock, Executive Director of Production OperationsKatie Walker, Senior ProducerSarah Bolding, Director of BrandsArt Ross, Account ManagerCristian Villalobos, Production CoordinatorAbout Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

107,bc252e94-6c54-3941-9674-bc29c28c0dfa,SNA,2022-10-17,7 Under-the-Radar Retirement Stocks With 10% Upside Potential,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-under-radar-retirement-stocks-144934912.html,1665672574,STORY,"['SNA', 'SWKS', 'TSCO', 'DOX', 'RHI']","[With the world seemingly attempting to destroy itself, investors could use some under-the-radar retirement stocks. No, these ideas won’t make you rich. Instead, they’re more aligned with keeping your portfolio relatively safe through the storm. A combination of steady dividend payments and 10% upside potential by end of 2023 should make these ideas even more attractive.Of course, most folks arguably want the hottest tips on Wall Street. The problem with going through this approach is the broader context. Right now, the U.S. economy operates ambiguously amid the Federal Reserve’s hawkish monetary policy. Beyond our borders, the Ukraine crisis will probably drag on at least for the next several months. On top of all this, we have global recession fears.Under this framework, under-the-radar retirement stocks with 10% upside potential carries a premium. Below are some compelling ideas to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTSCOTractor Supply$196.59DOXAmdocs$78.84RHIRobert Half$79.64SAPSAP.$82.16SNASnap-on$206.55SWKSSkyworks Solutions$79.98SIMOSilicon Motion$58.42Tractor Supply (TSCO)IDEX stock: An electric tractor sits in a field on a sunny day with a wind turbine in the background.Source: Matthew Troke / Shutterstock.comA boring name but a necessity, Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) is an American retail chain of stores. Specifically, the company specializes in the home improvement, agriculture, lawn and garden maintenance, livestock and equine sectors. In addition, it provides pet care products for recreational farmers and ranchers, pet owners and landowners.By nature, Tractor Supply represents one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks to buy. However, on a technical basis, shares slipped nearly 14% on a year-to-date basis, providing a relative discount. In addition, Tractor Supply provides a forward yield of 1.83%. It’s not the greatest thing in the world but it’s something.Per Gurufocus.com, TSCO rates as a fairly valued investment. Based on its core attributes – strong three-year revenue growth rate and a highly profitable business – TSCO should gain a little over 10% by the end of 2023. Other factors to bolster Tractor Supply’s case is decent stability in the balance sheet. As well, the company features a return on equity of 53%, one of the highest metrics in the industry. Therefore, it’s a high-quality business.Story continuesRobert Half (RHI)An image of a businesswoman shaking hands with a female executive at a job interviewSource: ShutterstockAdmittedly, you’re probably not hearing too many great reports about staffing agency Robert Half (NYSE:RHI). With the labor market remaining tight, people who want jobs can get jobs. So, why bother with Robert Half? At the same time, this inquiry’s underlying sentiment makes RHI one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks.True, indicators such as the latest September jobs report does seem to suggest that employers hire like there’s no tomorrow. But tomorrow does exist. His name is Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Committed to cooling inflation, Powell seems ready to cool off the labor market, or at least uppercut it, if necessary. But under those circumstances, many folks will enter desperation mode. That’s why RHI represents one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks. It’s all about looking ahead.Fundamentally, Robert Half represents a full stack. First, it features a forward yield of 2.16%. Second, the company enjoys a robust balance sheet, solid growth and excellent profitability metrics. Based on its projected fair valuation trends, RHI should easily be up 10% by end of 2023.Amdocs (DOX)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comAmdocs (NASDAQ:DOX) specializes in software and services for communications, media and financial services providers and digital enterprises. Given the relevance of this industry, Amdocs achieved a rare feat in 2022. It’s up for the year, to the tune of 5.5%.Not discussed with much regularity, the lack of exposure makes DOX one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks to buy. For the income-seeking folks, Amdocs features a forward yield of 2%. Moreover, it boasts nine years of consecutive dividend increases. In contrast, the technology sector’s average yield sits at 1.37%. More importantly, Amdocs carries strong financial metrics. Anchored by a decently stable balance sheet, the company commands excellent income statement metrics. For instance, its three-year free cash flow (FCF) growth rate stands at 34.7%, beating out the industry median of 11.5%. As well, its net margin of 12.1% beats out nearly 82% of the competition.Based on prevailing valuation trajectories, DOX should gain close to 10% by end of 2023. However, if you can wait till the middle of 2024, DOX has a better chance of shining.SAP (SAP)SAP sign is seen at SAP SuccessFactors Global Headquarters in South San Francisco, CaliforniaSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comA business software giant, SAP (NYSE:SAP) undergirds the supply chain flow of several Global 500 companies. Of course, the problem right now is that with global supply chains snarled, SAP ironically struggled for relevance. For the year, shares slipped a staggering 42%, disheartening market participants.At the same time, the red ink makes for SAP being one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks. Indeed, the volatility represents a great time to consider the company’s myriad positives. For instance, it features a forward yield of 2.5%. Again, the technology sector’s average yield sits at 1.37%.Even better, Gurufocus.com rates SAP as significantly undervalued. Enjoying a decently stable balance sheet, SAP draws you toward its robust income statement. For example, the company features a three-year FCF growth rate of 24.5%, besting 66% of the competition. On the bottom line, SAP has a net margin of 13.4%, superior to more than 83% of the industry. As well, SAP features a high-quality business, with a return on equity of 10.6%. However, investors may need to be a little patient with this one. Fundamentally, it’s on track to be up 3% by end of 2023. By end of 2024, it could be near 10% up.Snap-on (SNA)retirement stocks: miniature figurines climb a staircase made of coinsSource: ShutterstockTied to the industrial products industry, Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) enjoys everyday relevance. Manufacturing and marketing high-end tools and equipment for professional use in the transportation industry, the company is a staple among the automotive, marine, aviation and railroad industries. Following the close of the Oct. 12 session, SNA is down 2.6% for the year. That’s not bad considering the wider circumstances.SNA brings plenty of goodies to the table among under-the-radar retirement stocks. For one thing, the company carries a forward yield of 2.73%. In contrast, the consumer discretionary average yield is 1.9%. On the financials, Snap-on commands significant strengths across the board.On the company’s balance sheet, it features an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.63. This compares to the industry median of 0.54. Regarding income, Snap-on has a three-year book growth rate of 12%, beating out nearly 71% of the competition. Its return on equity stands at a stout 20.8%, reflecting a high-quality business.Based on valuation trajectories, SNA may be up 5% by the end of 2023. However, if sentiment moves toward Snap-on’s stable business, shares have a solid shot at 10% up.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) manufactures semiconductors for use in radio frequency and mobile communications systems. Because of this specialty, Skyworks commands significant relevance toward the 5G rollout. Essentially, the company undergirds the latest innovation in wireless connectivity, thereby making it one of the more compelling under-the-radar retirement stocks to buy.While SWKS represents a known commodity, not too many folks want to touch it right now; hence its in-the-shadows profile. Since the start of this year, Skyworks tanked over 50% of equity value. However, the company could make for an interesting long-term idea for patient, volatility-tolerating investors. Notably, Skyworks provides a forward yield of 3.12%. It also features eight years of consecutive dividend increases.Though the losses for SWKS are glaring, it might be a mistake to focus too much on this distraction. Per Gurufocus.com, SKWS is significantly undervalued. In addition, Skyworks enjoys a stable balance sheet and robust growth. Moreover, with a return on equity of nearly 25% (among the upper echelon in the industry), Skyworks represents a high-quality business.Based on valuation trajectories, SWKS has a solid chance of breaking into double-digit territory sometime in 2024. Fundamentally, the company is tied in with one of the most enticing growth sectors in 5G.Silicon Motion (SIMO)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockSilicon Motion (NASDAQ:SIMO) carries significant risks. It develops NAND flash controller integrated circuits for solid-state storage devices. However, because of the supply chain disruptions in the semiconductor space, along with regional geopolitical tensions, SIMO is volatile.Since the beginning of this year, SIMO stock dropped nearly 39% of equity value. In the trailing month, it’s down 19%, reflecting ever-worsening volatility. At the same time, once the selloff fades, SIMO could be intriguing. For instance, the company features a forward yield of 3.12%. As well, it enjoys eight years of dividend increases.Now, another risk factor to consider. Gurufocus.com labels SIMO as a possible value trap, a warning that shouldn’t go ignored. However, it’s also fair to point out that the company enjoys strengths across the financial spectrum. This includes excellent growth and profitability metrics. In addition, its balance sheet carries no long-term debt.With recent volatility, it’s a bit difficult to predict where SIMO may go. However, based on valuation trends, SIMO can easily hit 10% up by the end of 2024 if circumstances in the broader semiconductor space improves.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

108,70b6dd92-a932-37da-b4f7-640afe3e76d8,VZ,2022-10-17,Is Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) A High Quality Stock To Own?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-nyse-vz-120253905.html,1666008173,STORY,['VZ'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Verizon Communications is:24% = US$21b ÷ US$87b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.24.Does Verizon Communications Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Verizon Communications has a better ROE than the average (13%) in the Telecom industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Verizon Communications by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesVerizon Communications' Debt And Its 24% ROEVerizon Communications clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.73. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Verizon Communications may not be the best stock to buy.

Electric vehicles, biotechnology, social networking stocks, cloud software companies and the like. These are the sort of companies that can go up five- or 10-fold if their businesses find sustained market success. On the other hand, their stocks can easily end up losing most of their value if anything goes wrong and/or there is a broader correction in the tech sector.Over the past year, the Nasdaq is down 33.5%, with many of the individual components suffering far greater losses as investors refocused their attention from future growth to current profits and cash flows. It feels as though investors are hyper-focused on short-term losses rather than long-term potential, such as where a company may be in, say, 2030.On the bright side, this year’s bear market has created some stellar opportunities for long-term investors looking for Nasdaq stocks to buy and hold. Below are seven of them.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTXNTexas Instruments$168.11JDJD.com$45.49IBKRInteractive Brokers$80.10PEPPepsiCo$180.71CEGConstellation Energy$87.54CSXCSX Corporation$29.98IDXXIDEXX Laboratories$382.90Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold: Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is an analog semiconductor company. Analog semiconductors are vital because they turn real-world information such as weather conditions into data. The ability to sense and process external information is crucial for enabling cutting-edge technologies such as autonomous driving, remote monitoring and internet of things applications.Semiconductor shortages in 2021 led to high prices and record profits across the industry. The boom has turned into a bust this year, however, as demand for consumer electronics such as televisions and laptops has dropped significantly from peak 2021 levels. Texas Instruments has been able to sidestep much of this cyclical pain, though, since its analog chips tend to go into slower-moving industrial markets rather than hot consumer products.Story continuesTexas Instruments is also a cash flow machine. Management is laser-focused on the metric, noting in a recent presentation: “We believe that growth of free cash flow per share is the primary driver of long-term value.”This focus has worked out well for shareholders. Over the past 10 years, TXN stock has averaged a 20.6% return and it offers a 3.1% dividend yield.JD.com (JD)JD.com (JD) logo displayed at the entrance to the company's Silicon Valley office.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comChinese tech stocks have been an abject failure over the past year. Investors have lost a ton of money in the sector, and many traders have understandably thrown in the towel. Obviously, Chinese securities carry elevated political and financial risks right now.That said, China still has more than a billion people and most of them are going to shop online. JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is one of the country’s most promising e-commerce services. It has built a reputation for higher product quality standards than its rivals, which has been a big selling point in a market that has a problem with knock-off and counterfeit goods. In addition, JD has invested heavily in logistics, which has powered fast and reliable delivery schedules.JD stock is now down nearly 60% from its 2021 peak. This has left shares trading at just 16 times forward earnings. Meanwhile, the company’s market capitalization is down to $71 billion. That’s a pretty small figure for a company whose annual sales are expected to top $170 billion in 2023.As long as Chinese stocks as a group remain available to American investors, JD stock should be one of the leaders in its category.Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold: Interactive Brokers (IBKR)A concept image showing hands holding a globe with stock charts in the background.Source: ShutterstockInteractive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) is a leading discount brokerage firm. The company services a wide variety of customers ranging from small retail accounts to registered financial advisors to hedge funds. Interactive Brokers has a global reach, offering services to investors in dozens of countries. It also offers a vast array of tradable markets, including Europe, Asia, and even emerging markets such as Mexico, which are all available within a single trading account.The firm is set to benefit dramatically from higher interest rates. For starters, it gets to charge much higher interest rates on margin loans thanks to rising rates. The cost of a U.S. dollar margin loan has gone up from 1.6% to 5.3% at Interactive in recent months thanks to the ongoing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Additionally, volatile markets tend to lead to more trading activity, which can boost profitability.IBRK stock isn’t just a near-term interest rate play, however. The company has long-term appeal. Founder Thomas Peterffy is a visionary within the brokerage services industry and has built his company to thrive on a generational timeframe. In addition, the company’s focus on low costs and excellent trading execution has led to the firm having a stellar reputation with professional traders. As the brokerage industry continues to consolidate, Interactive should be one of the biggest winners.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comIf you look through a list of Nasdaq stocks, there are a surprisingly high number of firms that have nothing to do with technology. Take PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), for example. The soft drink and snack foods maker is one of the safest and most reliable blue chip stocks listed on the Nasdaq.PepsiCo will rarely wow investors with an amazing performance in any given year. Over time, however, the company’s shares have steadily marched upward, with an average annual return of 12% over the past decade. The company is also a dividend machine. It has increased its annual dividend for 50 years in a row, putting it among the elite Dividend Kings.Some investors might be put off by the fact that PEP stock is trading at nearly 25 times forward earnings. That’s fairly expensive, especially in a bear market. However, shares are worth the price, especially for long-term investors. Pepsico delivers reliable earnings year in and year out, and it pays investors an increasingly large dividend as well.Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold: Constellation Energy (CEG)Source: ShutterstockPower utility Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG) is another quality, sleep-well-at-night Nasdaq stock. The firm is one of the larger publicly traded electricity utilities with a market capitalization of nearly $30 billion.The company’s claim to fame is its large capacity for nuclear power generation. Nuclear power had been viewed as a fading asset in recent years due to high costs, regulatory pushback and a preference for other renewables. However, solar and wind have run into some pricing and capacity issues of their own. Meanwhile, the world is facing severe electricity generation issues in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.This has created something of a nuclear renaissance. Expect more research, investment, subsidies, and so on to go into nuclear going forward as policymakers increasingly look to nuclear as a “bridge” capacity generator between fossil fuels and green renewables. The Inflation Reduction Act, for example, provided significant subsidies to carbon-free power production, which includes nuclear.Constellation shares just started trading in early 2022, as it was spun off from another power utility. Shares are up more than 130% since then. Expect CEG stock to continue rallying as more investors discover this unique clean energy utility.CSX Corporation (CSX)Is It Time for Investors to Get On Board CSX Stock?Source: ShutterstockRailroad operator CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) is another firm that most people probably didn’t realize was on the Nasdaq. Railroads are an interesting asset class. They were the original American growth stocks. American railroad booms led to several bouts of market euphoria in the 1800s. Over a long enough time horizon, however, every new technology becomes a commodity product.Railroads have enjoyed a revival in recent years. Much of this is due to rising fuel prices. They have much better per-mile efficiency than trucks, which is a key consideration given soaring fuel prices. Also, there has been considerable progress in electrifying and automating rail transport. This improves economics for the industry while lowering its environmental footprint.Make no mistake about it, 2023 is going to be a rough year for railroads, including CSX. We’re likely to see big drops in sales of consumer durable goods such as appliances, building materials, automobiles, and so on. This means less cargo business for the rails. Over the longer-term, however, railroads are the best way to move large amounts of goods around, and operators like CSX have great profit margins thanks to local monopolies in many of the markets they serve.After a 20% decline this year, CSX stock now trades for just 15 times forward earnings.Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX)vet looking at a dog's xray to represent pet stocks like IDXXSource: ShutterstockIdexx Laboratories (NASDAQ:IDXX) is a life sciences company focused on animal health. It primarily offers solutions for companion animals, i.e., pets. Idexx has three main lines of business. It distributes in-clinic testing and screening products that veterinarians can use in their offices. It has a testing service where pet owners and vets can send samples to a network of Idexx-affiliated laboratories for processing. And there’s Idexx’s software business, which offers patient and practice management and client outreach for veterinarian offices.IDXX stock was one of the past decade’s unheralded winners. Shares soared more than 1,000% between 2012 and 2021. In 2022, Idexx has fallen by nearly 42%. However, the same factors that powered the stock’s 10-fold rally over the past decade persist. Namely, people are increasingly viewing their pets as family. As folks have tended to have fewer kids in recent years, it has freed up more money and attention for animal companions. The pandemic accelerated this trend as people were stuck at home and looking for company.IDXX stock sold off as the pandemic-induced animal adoption boom came to an end. But the longer-term trend hasn’t changed, and shares will be back to full health in due time.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in TXN stock.

The decision has resulted in 45 staff members of G4 TV losing their jobs.In a memo, obtained by Variety, Comcast Spectacor chairman and CEO Dave Scott cited low viewership and said the network had not achieved “sustainable financial results.”“Over the past several months, we worked hard to generate that interest in G4, but viewership is low and the network has not achieved sustainable financial results,” Scott wrote. “This is certainly not what we hoped for, and, as a result, we have made the very difficult decision to discontinue G4’s operations, effective immediately.“Comcast Spectacor in July 2020 said it would reboot G4 TV, which NBCUniversal shut down in 2013 (after the network first launched in 2002). Russell Arons, the former Warner Bros., Machinima, EA and Mattel exec who joined G4 as president in September 2021, left the company two months ago.The content studio and network officially returned to linear television on Nov. 16, 2021, after more than a year of the group releasing content online to test show new concepts. At launch, G4 TV was available Comcast’s Xfinity TV, Verizon Fios, Cox Communications and internet streaming service Philo. The network’s programming slate brought back fan-favorite legacy G4 shows like “Attack of the Show!” and “Xplay.”In addition to Arons, Comcast Spectacor had hired two G4 alums: Brian Terwilliger, most recently at WWE and former producer for G4’s “Attack of the Show!”, joined as VP of programming and creative strategy. Blair Herter, who once worked on both “X-Play” and “Attack of the Show!”, had come on board as Comcast Spectacor’s VP of content partnerships and brand development.G4 had established its own broadcast studio in Burbank, Calif., outfitted for professional esports gameplay. The roster of talent for the short-lived network include returning G4 hosts Kevin Pereira and Adam Sessler; esports personalities Alex “Goldenboy” Mendez (host of NBC’s “The Titan Games”), Ovilee May and Froskurinn; WWE Superstar Xavier Woods (aka Austin Creed); YouTube personalities Kassem G, Jirard “The Completionist” Khalil and Gina Darling; Twitch streamers Fiona Nova and Will Neff; livestreamer CodeMiko; and a “degenerate rat-puppet” named Ratty.Story continuesG4’s shutdown was first reported by Deadline.Read Scott’s Sunday email to G4 staffers:October 16, 2022Team:As you know, G4 was re-introduced last year to tap into the popularity of gaming. We invested to create the new G4 as an online and TV destination for fans to be entertained, be inspired, and connect with gaming content.Over the past several months, we worked hard to generate that interest in G4, but viewership is low and the network has not achieved sustainable financial results. This is certainly not what we hoped for, and, as a result, we have made the very difficult decision to discontinue G4’s operations, effective immediately.I know this is disappointing news, and I’m disappointed, too. I want to thank you and everyone on the G4 team for the hard work and commitment to the network.

Selling at an average price of US$258, which is higher than the current price, may have been the wisest decision for these insiders as their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for McDonald's The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At McDonald'sThe Executive VP &amp; CFO, Ian Borden, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.0m worth of shares at a price of US$256 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$243. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of McDonald's shares, than buying. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like McDonald's better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At McDonald's Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at McDonald's. Specifically, insiders ditched US$3.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. McDonald's insiders own 0.09% of the company, currently worth about US$169m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About McDonald's Insiders?Insiders sold McDonald's shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for McDonald's you should be aware of.But note: McDonald's may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

No, these ideas won’t make you rich. Instead, they’re more aligned with keeping your portfolio relatively safe through the storm. A combination of steady dividend payments and 10% upside potential by end of 2023 should make these ideas even more attractive.Of course, most folks arguably want the hottest tips on Wall Street. The problem with going through this approach is the broader context. Right now, the U.S. economy operates ambiguously amid the Federal Reserve’s hawkish monetary policy. Beyond our borders, the Ukraine crisis will probably drag on at least for the next several months. On top of all this, we have global recession fears.Under this framework, under-the-radar retirement stocks with 10% upside potential carries a premium. Below are some compelling ideas to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTSCOTractor Supply$196.59DOXAmdocs$78.84RHIRobert Half$79.64SAPSAP.$82.16SNASnap-on$206.55SWKSSkyworks Solutions$79.98SIMOSilicon Motion$58.42Tractor Supply (TSCO)IDEX stock: An electric tractor sits in a field on a sunny day with a wind turbine in the background.Source: Matthew Troke / Shutterstock.comA boring name but a necessity, Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) is an American retail chain of stores. Specifically, the company specializes in the home improvement, agriculture, lawn and garden maintenance, livestock and equine sectors. In addition, it provides pet care products for recreational farmers and ranchers, pet owners and landowners.By nature, Tractor Supply represents one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks to buy. However, on a technical basis, shares slipped nearly 14% on a year-to-date basis, providing a relative discount. In addition, Tractor Supply provides a forward yield of 1.83%. It’s not the greatest thing in the world but it’s something.Per Gurufocus.com, TSCO rates as a fairly valued investment. Based on its core attributes – strong three-year revenue growth rate and a highly profitable business – TSCO should gain a little over 10% by the end of 2023. Other factors to bolster Tractor Supply’s case is decent stability in the balance sheet. As well, the company features a return on equity of 53%, one of the highest metrics in the industry. Therefore, it’s a high-quality business.Story continuesRobert Half (RHI)An image of a businesswoman shaking hands with a female executive at a job interviewSource: ShutterstockAdmittedly, you’re probably not hearing too many great reports about staffing agency Robert Half (NYSE:RHI). With the labor market remaining tight, people who want jobs can get jobs. So, why bother with Robert Half? At the same time, this inquiry’s underlying sentiment makes RHI one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks.True, indicators such as the latest September jobs report does seem to suggest that employers hire like there’s no tomorrow. But tomorrow does exist. His name is Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Committed to cooling inflation, Powell seems ready to cool off the labor market, or at least uppercut it, if necessary. But under those circumstances, many folks will enter desperation mode. That’s why RHI represents one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks. It’s all about looking ahead.Fundamentally, Robert Half represents a full stack. First, it features a forward yield of 2.16%. Second, the company enjoys a robust balance sheet, solid growth and excellent profitability metrics. Based on its projected fair valuation trends, RHI should easily be up 10% by end of 2023.Amdocs (DOX)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comAmdocs (NASDAQ:DOX) specializes in software and services for communications, media and financial services providers and digital enterprises. Given the relevance of this industry, Amdocs achieved a rare feat in 2022. It’s up for the year, to the tune of 5.5%.Not discussed with much regularity, the lack of exposure makes DOX one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks to buy. For the income-seeking folks, Amdocs features a forward yield of 2%. Moreover, it boasts nine years of consecutive dividend increases. In contrast, the technology sector’s average yield sits at 1.37%. More importantly, Amdocs carries strong financial metrics. Anchored by a decently stable balance sheet, the company commands excellent income statement metrics. For instance, its three-year free cash flow (FCF) growth rate stands at 34.7%, beating out the industry median of 11.5%. As well, its net margin of 12.1% beats out nearly 82% of the competition.Based on prevailing valuation trajectories, DOX should gain close to 10% by end of 2023. However, if you can wait till the middle of 2024, DOX has a better chance of shining.SAP (SAP)SAP sign is seen at SAP SuccessFactors Global Headquarters in South San Francisco, CaliforniaSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comA business software giant, SAP (NYSE:SAP) undergirds the supply chain flow of several Global 500 companies. Of course, the problem right now is that with global supply chains snarled, SAP ironically struggled for relevance. For the year, shares slipped a staggering 42%, disheartening market participants.At the same time, the red ink makes for SAP being one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks. Indeed, the volatility represents a great time to consider the company’s myriad positives. For instance, it features a forward yield of 2.5%. Again, the technology sector’s average yield sits at 1.37%.Even better, Gurufocus.com rates SAP as significantly undervalued. Enjoying a decently stable balance sheet, SAP draws you toward its robust income statement. For example, the company features a three-year FCF growth rate of 24.5%, besting 66% of the competition. On the bottom line, SAP has a net margin of 13.4%, superior to more than 83% of the industry. As well, SAP features a high-quality business, with a return on equity of 10.6%. However, investors may need to be a little patient with this one. Fundamentally, it’s on track to be up 3% by end of 2023. By end of 2024, it could be near 10% up.Snap-on (SNA)retirement stocks: miniature figurines climb a staircase made of coinsSource: ShutterstockTied to the industrial products industry, Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) enjoys everyday relevance. Manufacturing and marketing high-end tools and equipment for professional use in the transportation industry, the company is a staple among the automotive, marine, aviation and railroad industries. Following the close of the Oct. 12 session, SNA is down 2.6% for the year. That’s not bad considering the wider circumstances.SNA brings plenty of goodies to the table among under-the-radar retirement stocks. For one thing, the company carries a forward yield of 2.73%. In contrast, the consumer discretionary average yield is 1.9%. On the financials, Snap-on commands significant strengths across the board.On the company’s balance sheet, it features an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.63. This compares to the industry median of 0.54. Regarding income, Snap-on has a three-year book growth rate of 12%, beating out nearly 71% of the competition. Its return on equity stands at a stout 20.8%, reflecting a high-quality business.Based on valuation trajectories, SNA may be up 5% by the end of 2023. However, if sentiment moves toward Snap-on’s stable business, shares have a solid shot at 10% up.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) manufactures semiconductors for use in radio frequency and mobile communications systems. Because of this specialty, Skyworks commands significant relevance toward the 5G rollout. Essentially, the company undergirds the latest innovation in wireless connectivity, thereby making it one of the more compelling under-the-radar retirement stocks to buy.While SWKS represents a known commodity, not too many folks want to touch it right now; hence its in-the-shadows profile. Since the start of this year, Skyworks tanked over 50% of equity value. However, the company could make for an interesting long-term idea for patient, volatility-tolerating investors. Notably, Skyworks provides a forward yield of 3.12%. It also features eight years of consecutive dividend increases.Though the losses for SWKS are glaring, it might be a mistake to focus too much on this distraction. Per Gurufocus.com, SKWS is significantly undervalued. In addition, Skyworks enjoys a stable balance sheet and robust growth. Moreover, with a return on equity of nearly 25% (among the upper echelon in the industry), Skyworks represents a high-quality business.Based on valuation trajectories, SWKS has a solid chance of breaking into double-digit territory sometime in 2024. Fundamentally, the company is tied in with one of the most enticing growth sectors in 5G.Silicon Motion (SIMO)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockSilicon Motion (NASDAQ:SIMO) carries significant risks. It develops NAND flash controller integrated circuits for solid-state storage devices. However, because of the supply chain disruptions in the semiconductor space, along with regional geopolitical tensions, SIMO is volatile.Since the beginning of this year, SIMO stock dropped nearly 39% of equity value. In the trailing month, it’s down 19%, reflecting ever-worsening volatility. At the same time, once the selloff fades, SIMO could be intriguing. For instance, the company features a forward yield of 3.12%. As well, it enjoys eight years of dividend increases.Now, another risk factor to consider. Gurufocus.com labels SIMO as a possible value trap, a warning that shouldn’t go ignored. However, it’s also fair to point out that the company enjoys strengths across the financial spectrum. This includes excellent growth and profitability metrics. In addition, its balance sheet carries no long-term debt.With recent volatility, it’s a bit difficult to predict where SIMO may go. However, based on valuation trends, SIMO can easily hit 10% up by the end of 2024 if circumstances in the broader semiconductor space improves.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Are they going to change?... I think they will because, obviously, we have technology.""Fernandez says many customers now use video demonstrations to see products and attend e-parties in addition to in-person events, particularly in South America.""What we're seeing in many of our developed countries are more and more parties, what we call e-parties, which is people that host consumers, and they have these communities around the screen, so a combination of both [in-person and online],"" he explained.In the company's most recent quarterly earnings report, total net sales came in at $340.4 million, a decrease of 18%, yet boosted by the strength of South America, particularly from recruitment and retention efforts. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, sales in South America increased 13% from the year prior.""In some parts of the world like Latin America and some parts of Asia, direct selling is a very relevant channel,"" Fernandez told Yahoo Finance. ""We're going to be investing 99% of our resources into making our core business, which is direct selling, even better and better in those countries.""In-person parties aren't nearly as popular in the U.S. market, however.""Some other countries like Western Europe or the U.S., we understand the consumers moved, or some other consumers move from direct selling into e-commerce or retail and that's where we want to be, "" Fernandez said.Story continuesTarget will hold ""only 20, 25 SKUs (stock keeping units),"" while Tupperware over all carries over 200 SKUs every single month on its site.""Once we start competing like any other consumer brand in the shelves or in the screen of the major retailers, then we're going to be considered like any other CPG company and our performance is going to be judged by our performance of the numbers,"" he noted.Though the stock is under pressure, down nearly 40% compared to two years ago and down more than 71% year-over-year, Fernandez seemed optimistic about the retail approach to help boost returns and compete against the likes of Rubbermaid, The Container Store, KitchenAid and other companies that sell food storage containers.Fernandez joined the company in April of 2020 from Avon, where he led a transformation strategy, and hopes to do the same at Tupperware.""The most important thing about the brand is that, let's face it, it was a little bit dated and it was dated because we were reaching just a certain amount of consumers. What we're trying to do right now is to gain brand relevance and to be where the new consumers are, where the new people are, and wherever they are.""Tupperware items, including a set of ""retro"" storage containers at left, rest on a table during a Tupperware party in Sebastian, Florida, on Wednesday, May 18, 2022. A curated selection of Tupperware offerings became available at Target stores and Target.com, CEO Miguel Fernandez revealed in a post on Linkedin. (Stephen M.

(NYSE:ZBH) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Zimmer Biomet Holdings Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.49bUS$1.59bUS$1.72bUS$1.75bUS$1.77bUS$1.80bUS$1.83bUS$1.87bUS$1.90bUS$1.94bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 1.47%Est @ 1.62%Est @ 1.73%Est @ 1.8%Est @ 1.86%Est @ 1.89% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7% US$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.1kUS$1.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$12bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.7%– 2.0%) = US$42bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$42b÷ ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$22bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$34b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$107, the company appears quite good value at a 35% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Zimmer Biomet Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.006. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

No, these ideas won’t make you rich. Instead, they’re more aligned with keeping your portfolio relatively safe through the storm. A combination of steady dividend payments and 10% upside potential by end of 2023 should make these ideas even more attractive.Of course, most folks arguably want the hottest tips on Wall Street. The problem with going through this approach is the broader context. Right now, the U.S. economy operates ambiguously amid the Federal Reserve’s hawkish monetary policy. Beyond our borders, the Ukraine crisis will probably drag on at least for the next several months. On top of all this, we have global recession fears.Under this framework, under-the-radar retirement stocks with 10% upside potential carries a premium. Below are some compelling ideas to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTSCOTractor Supply$196.59DOXAmdocs$78.84RHIRobert Half$79.64SAPSAP.$82.16SNASnap-on$206.55SWKSSkyworks Solutions$79.98SIMOSilicon Motion$58.42Tractor Supply (TSCO)IDEX stock: An electric tractor sits in a field on a sunny day with a wind turbine in the background.Source: Matthew Troke / Shutterstock.comA boring name but a necessity, Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) is an American retail chain of stores. Specifically, the company specializes in the home improvement, agriculture, lawn and garden maintenance, livestock and equine sectors. In addition, it provides pet care products for recreational farmers and ranchers, pet owners and landowners.By nature, Tractor Supply represents one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks to buy. However, on a technical basis, shares slipped nearly 14% on a year-to-date basis, providing a relative discount. In addition, Tractor Supply provides a forward yield of 1.83%. It’s not the greatest thing in the world but it’s something.Per Gurufocus.com, TSCO rates as a fairly valued investment. Based on its core attributes – strong three-year revenue growth rate and a highly profitable business – TSCO should gain a little over 10% by the end of 2023. Other factors to bolster Tractor Supply’s case is decent stability in the balance sheet. As well, the company features a return on equity of 53%, one of the highest metrics in the industry. Therefore, it’s a high-quality business.Story continuesRobert Half (RHI)An image of a businesswoman shaking hands with a female executive at a job interviewSource: ShutterstockAdmittedly, you’re probably not hearing too many great reports about staffing agency Robert Half (NYSE:RHI). With the labor market remaining tight, people who want jobs can get jobs. So, why bother with Robert Half? At the same time, this inquiry’s underlying sentiment makes RHI one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks.True, indicators such as the latest September jobs report does seem to suggest that employers hire like there’s no tomorrow. But tomorrow does exist. His name is Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Committed to cooling inflation, Powell seems ready to cool off the labor market, or at least uppercut it, if necessary. But under those circumstances, many folks will enter desperation mode. That’s why RHI represents one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks. It’s all about looking ahead.Fundamentally, Robert Half represents a full stack. First, it features a forward yield of 2.16%. Second, the company enjoys a robust balance sheet, solid growth and excellent profitability metrics. Based on its projected fair valuation trends, RHI should easily be up 10% by end of 2023.Amdocs (DOX)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comAmdocs (NASDAQ:DOX) specializes in software and services for communications, media and financial services providers and digital enterprises. Given the relevance of this industry, Amdocs achieved a rare feat in 2022. It’s up for the year, to the tune of 5.5%.Not discussed with much regularity, the lack of exposure makes DOX one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks to buy. For the income-seeking folks, Amdocs features a forward yield of 2%. Moreover, it boasts nine years of consecutive dividend increases. In contrast, the technology sector’s average yield sits at 1.37%. More importantly, Amdocs carries strong financial metrics. Anchored by a decently stable balance sheet, the company commands excellent income statement metrics. For instance, its three-year free cash flow (FCF) growth rate stands at 34.7%, beating out the industry median of 11.5%. As well, its net margin of 12.1% beats out nearly 82% of the competition.Based on prevailing valuation trajectories, DOX should gain close to 10% by end of 2023. However, if you can wait till the middle of 2024, DOX has a better chance of shining.SAP (SAP)SAP sign is seen at SAP SuccessFactors Global Headquarters in South San Francisco, CaliforniaSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comA business software giant, SAP (NYSE:SAP) undergirds the supply chain flow of several Global 500 companies. Of course, the problem right now is that with global supply chains snarled, SAP ironically struggled for relevance. For the year, shares slipped a staggering 42%, disheartening market participants.At the same time, the red ink makes for SAP being one of the under-the-radar retirement stocks. Indeed, the volatility represents a great time to consider the company’s myriad positives. For instance, it features a forward yield of 2.5%. Again, the technology sector’s average yield sits at 1.37%.Even better, Gurufocus.com rates SAP as significantly undervalued. Enjoying a decently stable balance sheet, SAP draws you toward its robust income statement. For example, the company features a three-year FCF growth rate of 24.5%, besting 66% of the competition. On the bottom line, SAP has a net margin of 13.4%, superior to more than 83% of the industry. As well, SAP features a high-quality business, with a return on equity of 10.6%. However, investors may need to be a little patient with this one. Fundamentally, it’s on track to be up 3% by end of 2023. By end of 2024, it could be near 10% up.Snap-on (SNA)retirement stocks: miniature figurines climb a staircase made of coinsSource: ShutterstockTied to the industrial products industry, Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) enjoys everyday relevance. Manufacturing and marketing high-end tools and equipment for professional use in the transportation industry, the company is a staple among the automotive, marine, aviation and railroad industries. Following the close of the Oct. 12 session, SNA is down 2.6% for the year. That’s not bad considering the wider circumstances.SNA brings plenty of goodies to the table among under-the-radar retirement stocks. For one thing, the company carries a forward yield of 2.73%. In contrast, the consumer discretionary average yield is 1.9%. On the financials, Snap-on commands significant strengths across the board.On the company’s balance sheet, it features an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.63. This compares to the industry median of 0.54. Regarding income, Snap-on has a three-year book growth rate of 12%, beating out nearly 71% of the competition. Its return on equity stands at a stout 20.8%, reflecting a high-quality business.Based on valuation trajectories, SNA may be up 5% by the end of 2023. However, if sentiment moves toward Snap-on’s stable business, shares have a solid shot at 10% up.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) manufactures semiconductors for use in radio frequency and mobile communications systems. Because of this specialty, Skyworks commands significant relevance toward the 5G rollout. Essentially, the company undergirds the latest innovation in wireless connectivity, thereby making it one of the more compelling under-the-radar retirement stocks to buy.While SWKS represents a known commodity, not too many folks want to touch it right now; hence its in-the-shadows profile. Since the start of this year, Skyworks tanked over 50% of equity value. However, the company could make for an interesting long-term idea for patient, volatility-tolerating investors. Notably, Skyworks provides a forward yield of 3.12%. It also features eight years of consecutive dividend increases.Though the losses for SWKS are glaring, it might be a mistake to focus too much on this distraction. Per Gurufocus.com, SKWS is significantly undervalued. In addition, Skyworks enjoys a stable balance sheet and robust growth. Moreover, with a return on equity of nearly 25% (among the upper echelon in the industry), Skyworks represents a high-quality business.Based on valuation trajectories, SWKS has a solid chance of breaking into double-digit territory sometime in 2024. Fundamentally, the company is tied in with one of the most enticing growth sectors in 5G.Silicon Motion (SIMO)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockSilicon Motion (NASDAQ:SIMO) carries significant risks. It develops NAND flash controller integrated circuits for solid-state storage devices. However, because of the supply chain disruptions in the semiconductor space, along with regional geopolitical tensions, SIMO is volatile.Since the beginning of this year, SIMO stock dropped nearly 39% of equity value. In the trailing month, it’s down 19%, reflecting ever-worsening volatility. At the same time, once the selloff fades, SIMO could be intriguing. For instance, the company features a forward yield of 3.12%. As well, it enjoys eight years of dividend increases.Now, another risk factor to consider. Gurufocus.com labels SIMO as a possible value trap, a warning that shouldn’t go ignored. However, it’s also fair to point out that the company enjoys strengths across the financial spectrum. This includes excellent growth and profitability metrics. In addition, its balance sheet carries no long-term debt.With recent volatility, it’s a bit difficult to predict where SIMO may go. However, based on valuation trends, SIMO can easily hit 10% up by the end of 2024 if circumstances in the broader semiconductor space improves.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola is:39% = US$9.6b ÷ US$25b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.39 in profit.Does Coca-Cola Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Coca-Cola has a higher ROE than the average (16%) in the Beverage industry.roeThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Coca-Cola.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Coca-Cola's Debt And Its 39% Return On EquityCoca-Cola clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.73. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: Coca-Cola may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

(NASDAQ:INTU) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 85% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 3.3% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 31% for shareholders. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Intuit, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Intuit, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Intuit ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuit?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Intuit already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Intuit's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Intuit is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.6% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.6% and 6.3% of the stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 22 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of IntuitThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Intuit Inc.. Insiders own US$3.0b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 12% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

135,30009339-10e2-32af-b567-d617938958a8,INTU,2022-10-17,7 Gig Economy Stocks Set to Explode in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-gig-economy-stocks-set-134827308.html,1665668907,STORY,"['MSFT', 'UPWK', 'HRB', 'PYPL', 'INTU']","[With the fading of the coronavirus pandemic, the inevitable push to the office sparked fundamental interest in gig economy stocks. After enjoying the freedoms of gig life, corporate employees simply don’t want to return to business as usual. What’s more, 40% of respondents in a Reli Exchange revealed that if they faced termination for their refusal to return to the office, they would instead start their own business.Thus, we have two paradigm shifts that bolster gig economy stocks. First, a radical telecommuting transition materialized in early 2020. Second, more people now consider entrepreneurialism as a viable career path. And essentially, that’s what the gig economy is: independent contractors branching out on their own.What’s more, experts project that this segment will continue to expand. By 2023, analysts anticipate that the projected gross volume of the gig economy is expected to reach $455.2 billion. Therefore, simply by logical deduction, gig economy stocks should explode next year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBetter yet, this market sector features diverse opportunities. It’s not just about freelance marketplaces, though that’s always an option. Instead, companies providing the tools and platforms for success may enjoy a significant upside. Below are the gig economy stocks to put on your radar.INTUIntuit$388.06HRBH&amp;R Block$38.75MSFTMicrosoft$225.75PYPLPayPal$83.81UPWKUpwork$13.32ROVRRover$3.87ADBEAdobe$286.15Intuit (INTU)Intuit and turbotax logo on a phone screen on top of a keyboard. INTU stock.Source: Julio Ricco / ShutterstockIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) might not intuitively rank among the gig economy stocks as a tax software provider. That is until you realize that taxes for independent contractors – colloquially referred to as 1099 workers – present significant differences from W2 employees.While it’s possible to write volumes on this subject, the gist of the matter is that gig workers are in business for themselves. Therefore, their taxes run similarly to corporate taxes. Rather than working for a salary, gig workers generate revenue and hopefully earn net income. From there, these 1099 workers can deduct legally allowed expenses from their gross income to whittle down their tax obligations.Story continuesOn the other hand, W2 employees whose sole income stems from their jobs have an easy tax-filing process. That’s why so many platforms offer free W2 services – it doesn’t take much skill to file these things.However, the opposite is true for 1099 folks. Therefore, Intuit’s tax-prep software should be in great demand in 2023 and beyond, making INTU one of the gig economy stocks to buy.H&amp;R Block (HRB)Image of a yellow building featuring the H&amp;R Block (HRB) logoSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comOne of the companies I’ve been pounding the table on recently, H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB), finally made good on its potential in 2022. Since the January opener, HRB gained about 58%, making it a scorcher. Remember that the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index fell around 25% during the same period.At the same time, the massive jump makes HRB risky relative to other gig economy stocks. For instance, in the trailing month, shares fell over 15%. Fundamentally, I suspect people cashing out of cryptos led to greater demand for H&amp;R Block. Due to cryptos’ novelty, this asset class’s taxation presents enormous complexities. Cynically, that’s a positive for HRB.While the enthusiasm was probably most significant for the tax year 2021, it’s also possible that H&amp;R Block will see a boon next year as well. That’s because many folks probably panicked this year. In addition, the company may provide excellent guidance for handling capital losses.While you may want to wait a bit for the volatility in HRB to die down, fundamental circumstances should improve. If so, it represents one of the gig economy stocks to buy.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comPerhaps best known as an all-around consumer technology giant, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) represents one of the most critical gig economy stocks. Mainly, I’m referring to its Software as a Service platform featuring myriad utilitarian applications like Word and Excel. When it comes to the language of business, gig workers need to be fluent in Microsoft.Frankly, if you don’t know these programs, you will not get very far in the gig economy.Based on the latest data, Microsoft Windows owns 75% of the desktop operating system market. Cynically, this should keep MSFT humming as one of the gig economy stocks to buy. True, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) symbolizes sizable competition at nearly 15% market share. But again, lacking familiarity with the Microsoft ecosystem is fatal in the business world.Plus, according to Gurufocus.com, MSFT ranks as modestly undervalued. Featuring financial strengths across the board, Microsoft is a good pick-up, especially with shares down 33% year-to-date.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comWhile Microsoft is a non-starter in terms of gig success, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) helps transition folks into the paradigm of the 1099 ecosystem. Unlike being a corporate employee, you don’t punch a clock in the gig economy. Nor do you have a paycheck coming in automatically every two weeks.Instead, you’ve got to present a sterling reputation to prospective clients (not employers). Otherwise, you’re not going to be winning many contracts. Moreover, you’ve got to generate your own invoices and submit them accordingly. And if circumstances go awry in this arena, it’s up to you to seek a resolution. Plenty of responsibilities exist, which can be initially overwhelming. Thankfully, PayPal’s financial technology (fintech) platform offers intuitive operations.I’m not going to claim to be a PayPal expert but in short, it acts as a self-employment portal. Not only do you essentially have a digital bank account, but you can also invoice and receive payment through the platform, all the while having the associated “paperwork” neatly organized.You really have to join the gig life to understand the true beauty of PayPal. But when you do, you’ll see why it’s one of the gig economy stocks to buy.Upwork (UPWK)upwork (UPWK) logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Santa Clara and San Francisco, California, Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) represents a freelancing platform. Essentially, Upwork connects professional talent with enterprises seeking specific gaps to fill. Fundamentally, UPWK is a direct play among gig economy stocks. That said, such a framework hasn’t been exceptionally positive.For instance, since the start of this year, UPWK stock has hemorrhaged over 60% of market value. That’s exceptionally steep, far more than the heavy-hit Nasdaq Composite, which dropped 34% during the same period. However, it’s also fair to point out that contrarians might view UPWK as a potential upside opportunity.Per Gurufocus.com, Upwork’s business is significantly undervalued. But even here, prospective investors should note that they must exercise patience. Yes, in the second quarter of 2022, Upwork generated nearly $157 million in revenue, up 26% against the year-ago period. However, net losses in the most recent quarter came out to $23.8 million versus a loss of $16.5 million one year ago.Still, with more people eager to consider making the pivot to the gig life, UPWK could be one of the gig economy stocks to buy.Rover (ROVR)The logo for Rover displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comFor those folks that want a unique take on gig economy stocks, Rover (NASDAQ:ROVR) may provide just that. Similar to Upwork, Rover connects service providers with service seekers. But in Rover’s case, the focus centres on pet care services. Mainly, this involves dog walking but could also incorporate other offerings like pet sitting and boarding.Fundamentally, Rover benefits strongly from America’s love for its pets. According to the American Pet Products Association, in 2021, consumers spent $123.6 billion on pets and related products and services. What’s more, every year since at least 2018, the total revenue of this industry has increased significantly.However, ROVR hasn’t exactly benefitted from the trend. Since the start of 2022, ROVR stock has tanked over 62% of its equity value. However, as society gradually normalizes – and especially if the return-to-the-office movement succeeds – 2023 could be a banner year for pet service providers. Therefore, it’s worth keeping ROVR on your radar for gig economy stocks to buAdobe (ADBE)Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.Source: Tattoboo / ShutterstockOne of the software giants, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), specializes in various applications. However, it’s probably best known for its Photoshop program. Much like Microsoft represents a must-have in the business world, Adobe is vital for creatives. But will this alone make it a solid buy among gig economy stocks? It turns out the answer is a surprising yes.While the creative industry carries a reputation for being a soft – and thereby lesser – skill, nothing could be further from the truth. Without getting bogged down into various statistics, just do a thought experiment: how successful will your startup be if your logo looked like it was drawn by a monkey with a paintbrush in its mouth? Creatives can be the difference between getting the critical contract and not.Now, if you really want hard data, take a look at this. “Fifty-nine percent of animators, art directors, painters, and illustrators are self-employed, according to BLS. That number is even higher for writers (64 percent) and photographers (68 percent).” It may not seem like it at first, but ADBE is a hidden opportunity among gig economy stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

These novel tracers offer the potential to provide key information about the metabolic environment of tumours, which could help to inform and improve therapy selection. The agreement was announced during the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) Congress in Barcelona, Spain.TLX250-CDx - the subject of Telix's recently completed Phase III ZIRCON study in clear cell renal cell carcinoma1 - targets the antigen, carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX). Expressed in many solid tumour types, CAIX can be used to identify hypoxic tumours,2 cells that have been deprived of oxygen, which can correlate with disease progression and resistance to therapy, including immunotherapy. Identifying such tumours may guide changes in care, from immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy to combination treatments that overcome the hypoxic barrier.[18F]-FLac, which Telix in-licensed in 2021,3 has shown promise in imaging lactate metabolism in oxygenated tumours. High lactate in tumours could prevent ICI responses and additionally be harmful in patients receiving ICI therapies.4 Understanding tumour lactate metabolic status could guide treatment decisions towards immunotherapy combinations that overcome this barrier.Story continuesTLX250-CDx and [18F]-FLac complement GE Healthcare Pharmaceutical Diagnostics' pipeline of investigational non-invasive [18F]-CD8 and [18F]-Granzyme-B imaging tracers for use by pharmaceutical companies in clinical trials, with the potential to predict and monitor response to immunotherapy.  Currently an average of only 20-40 percent of patients respond to immunotherapies, and patient suitability is typically determined by taking tumour biopsies.5Jonathan Barlow, SVP Global Business Development &amp; Alliance Management, Telix, said, ""This partnership will see our investigational imaging agents used more widely in third-party clinical trials. Excitingly, it will also help to expedite the development of [18F]-FLac, while expanding the utility of our TLX250-CDx imaging candidate.""Sanka Thiru, Global Business Leader, Immuno-Oncology, at GE Healthcare's Pharmaceutical Diagnostics business, said: ""This partnership expands our pharmaceutical services offering, including our toolbox of investigational PET imaging diagnostics. These aim to enrich clinical trials for pharmaceutical companies with the possibility of determining the metabolic environment and immune status of tumours, and if successful, help to improve speed to market for potential therapies. Ultimately, these PET imaging diagnostics could assist in delivering effective oncology therapies to patients.""Under the agreement, GE Healthcare will be responsible for the directed marketing and sales of Telix's imaging agents to pharmaceutical companies, with the close support of Telix, whilst Telix will be responsible for manufacturing and ongoing development of each product. Telix and GE Healthcare will explore validation of  [18F]-FLac for use in GE Healthcare's FASTlab™, an automated PET radiochemistry synthesiser, widely used for onsite production of FDG6 and other PET tracers.The agreement has an initial term of five years, subject to review and termination rights based on performance after three years.About Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited Telix is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialisation of diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals.

Naturally, the cut drew criticism from the U.S. as higher hydrocarbon prices helps Russia’s military aggression in Ukraine. As well, price hikes cause pain for consumers.Another factor that will likely bolster oil stocks to buy is the aforementioned war in Ukraine. On the battlefield, the Ukrainians gained significant momentum, retaking vast chunks of territory. Representing an embarrassment to the Russians, the Kremlin decided to double down. Therefore, geopolitical forces will likely constrain supply, which will probably send hydrocarbon energy prices higher. If a silver lining exists, it’s that not all hydrocarbon players represent overbought enterprises. Indeed, the below oil stocks to buy are great names at great prices.CVXChevron$159.67SHELShell$51.31ENBEnbridge$35.74KMIKinder Morgan$17.20PBRPetrobras$13.80SUSuncor Energy$31.27VLOValero Energy$117.50InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsChevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comOne of the world’s biggest oil stocks to buy, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) covers every area of the oil and gas industries. As of the close of the Oct. 12 session, CVX gained 32% on a year-to-date basis. Still, over the trailing six months, CVX lost a bit over 8%. This means that prospective investors can secure a relative deal before the hydrocarbon sector rises decisively.Being a vertically integrated company, Chevron enjoys a level of confidence and stability that many other oil stocks to buy can’t match. For instance, the company offers a forward yield of 3.57%. Moreover, Chevron feature 35 years of consecutive dividend increases.Better yet, Gurufocus.com labels CVX modestly undervalued based on the investor resource platform’s proprietary calculations. Although Chevron’s revenue performance could use some shoring up relative to the industry, it features solid profitability metrics. For example, the company’s return on equity stands at 20.5%, ranking better than nearly 72% of the competition. This also reflects Chevron’s higher quality business.Story continuesFinally, the oil giant enjoys a robust balance sheet, particularly a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.46 that sits favorably below 81% of the industry.Shell (SHEL)logo on a gas station in Iceland.Source: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comAnother top name among oil stocks to buy, Shell (NYSE:SHEL) represents one of the industry’s supermajors. By revenue and by profits, Shell consistently ranks among the world’s biggest companies. Since the start of this year, SHEL gained just under 13%. However, in the trailing six-month period, SHEL slipped nearly 12%, reflecting a relative discount before hydrocarbon prices surge.According to data from Dividend.com, Shell offers a forward yield of just under 4%. That’s a solid figure that will entice at least some investors. Still, it’s fair to point out that its years of consecutive dividend increases is zero. Therefore, management does have something to prove in the passive income department.Setting that issue aside, Gurufocusc.om labels SHEL modestly undervalued – and that’s against traditional metrics. The company’s forward price-earnings ratio pings at 4.6%, below the industry median of 6.6%. As well, Shell provides solid profitability metrics, including a return on equity of 21.6%. Here, the industry median is 7.4%.Enbridge (ENB)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comEnbridge (NYSE:ENB) is a multinational pipeline company. It owns and operates pipelines throughout Canada and the U.S., transporting crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Despite its broader relevance, ENB finds itself down a little over 9% for the year. In the trailing six months, ENB slipped over 23%.Still, such red ink might attract contrarians seeking compelling oil stocks to buy. What should really grab their attention is Enbridge’s staggeringly high forward yield. At 7.26%, it easily exceeds the energy average yield of 4.24%. Nevertheless, some caution is warranted as the company features zero years of consecutive dividend increases. According to Gurufocus.com, ENB is modestly undervalued based on proprietary calculations. Financially, Enbridge is geared as a profitability machine. For instance, its net margin stands at 10.2%, ranking better than 63% of the competition. In addition, the company enjoys at least 10 years of profitability.Kinder Morgan (KMI)Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comOone of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America, Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) specializes in owning and controlling oil and gas pipelines and terminals. Specifically, the company owns an interest in or operates approximately 83,000 miles of pipelines and 143 terminals. Since the beginning of this year, KMI only gained a little over 4%, representing a relative deal compared to a possible surge in demand over the horizon.As with other midstream players, Kinder Morgan appeals to investors of oil stocks to buy because of passive income opportunities. Per Dividend.com, the company offers a forward yield of 6.5%, conspicuously exceeding the industry average. It features five years of consecutive dividend increases; not particularly outstanding but not zero either.Per Gurufocus.com, KMI rates as modestly undervalued based on proprietary assessments. Financially, Kinder Morgan’s greatest strength lies in the bottom line. Its net margin of 13.8% ranks higher than nearly 68% of the competition. However, it also features strengths on the top line. For instance, the company’s three-year free cash flow (FCF) growth rate stands at 26.5%. This contrasts favorably with the industry median of 10.1%.Petrobras (PBR)Petrobras distributor in the industry and supply sector.. PBR stockSource: rafastockbr / Shutterstock.comBased in Brazil, Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) as the company is best known as specializes in petroleum and petroleum-related products. It’s also involved in natural gas, lubricants, biofuels and fertilizers, the latter which could be significant given food-commodity shortages. However, investors should realize that PBR features a higher risk profile than other oil stocks to buy because of its domestic politics.However, recent rumblings in the country’s presidential election process may bode well for Petrobras. We’ll have to see how circumstances hold up. For now, PBR features a YTD performance of almost 25% up, which is decent considering the circumstances. However, according to Dividend.com, Petrobras suspended its dividend payouts, which represents a drag.Nevertheless, if you’re seeking undervalued oil stocks to buy and are willing to accept volatility risks, PBR could be interesting. According to Gurufocus.com, it rates as modestly undervalued, particularly based on traditional metrics. For instance, the security’s forward PE ratio pings at just under 4 times. As mentioned earlier, the industry median is 6.6 times. Plus, Petrobras enjoys strong growth and profitability trends that geopolitical forces will likely bolster. As a bonus, it also features decent strengths in the balance sheet, especially a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.85 that slips favorably below 71% of the competition.Suncor Energy (SU)Suncor Energy logo displayed on a modern smartphoneSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comSuncor Energy (NYSE:SU) specializes in production of synthetic crude from oil sands. With hydrocarbon energy supply chains becoming a massively important topic, Suncor’s primary business commands fundamental relevance. For the year, SU gained nearly 22%, representing one of the solid performers among major oil stocks to buy.Notably, though, in the trailing six months, SU declined by over 6%. While not the most impressive discount, investors may want to take what they can get before the hydrocarbon sector potentially shoots much higher. According to Dividend.com, Suncor offers a forward yield of 4.6%. That’s slightly above average for the industry. However, the company lacks consecutive years of dividend increase.Per Gurufocus.com, Suncor features a modestly undervalued business. Currently, the company’s PE ratio pings at 6.5%, below the industry median’s 8.7%. Also, Suncor’s price-to-FCF ratio stands at 6.2 times. The median for the industry is 8.5 times, reflecting decent value.Valero Energy (VLO)Oil barrel and spilled oil in form of United States isolated on white; oil stocksSource: ShutterstockValero Energy (NYSE:VLO) is an international manufacturer and marketer of transportation fuels, other petrochemical products, and power. Throughout the U.S. and Canada, Valero owns and operates 15 refineries. It also has one in Wales. Since the start of this year, VLO gained an impressive 49%. Therefore, it’s one of those energy stocks to buy that may ride higher on present momentum.Based on present charting data, there may still be time to get on this train before it takes off again. In the trailing month, VLO gained “only” 3.5%. In addition to its capital gains potential, Valero provides something for the passive income folks. Per Dividend.com, the company offers a forward yield of 3.4%. Moreover, it features 10 years of consecutive dividend increases.According to Gurufocus.com, VLO rates as modestly undervalued. Presently, its PE ratio is 6.6 times, below the industry median 8.7 times. Further, the company offers a high-quality profile. Its return on equity stands at nearly 38%.

141,925e1b8e-07b7-3561-b3cc-113de010a48d,EL,2022-10-17,Estée Lauder Companies' (NYSE:EL) five-year total shareholder returns outpace the underlying earnings growth,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/est-e-lauder-companies-nyse-120218672.html,1666008138,STORY,['EL'],"[The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 15% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been pleasing. It has returned a market beating 92% in that time. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 35% drop, in the last year.While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Estée Lauder Companies achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 14% per year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 14%. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Estée Lauder Companies' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Estée Lauder Companies, it has a TSR of 101% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Estée Lauder Companies shareholders are down 34% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 25%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 15%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.
