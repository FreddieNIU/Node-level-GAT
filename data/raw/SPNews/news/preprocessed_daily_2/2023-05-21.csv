However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on Nucor's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Nucor How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Nucor is:36% = US$7.1b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.36 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Nucor's Earnings Growth And 36% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Nucor has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 14% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result, Nucor's exceptional 41% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Nucor's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 31% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Nucor's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Nucor Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Nucor has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 9.8%, meaning that it has the remaining 90% left over to reinvest into its business. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Besides, Nucor has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 18% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 12% over the same period.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Nucor's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

(NYSE:WMT) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 5th of September to $0.57. This takes the annual payment to 1.5% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. View our latest analysis for Walmart Walmart's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. The last dividend was quite easily covered by Walmart's earnings. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 79.7%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 31% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendWalmart Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.88 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.28. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 1.9% per annum over that time. Although we can't deny that the dividend has been remarkably stable in the past, the growth has been pretty muted.Walmart Could Grow Its DividendSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that Walmart has grown earnings per share at 6.8% per year over the past five years. The company is paying a reasonable amount of earnings to shareholders, and is growing earnings at a decent rate so we think it could be a decent dividend stock.Walmart Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

4,25eebd03-920c-3f74-b185-65fa5bdfcefe,JWN,2023-05-21,"Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) Pays A US$0.19 Dividend In Just Four Days",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nordstrom-inc-nyse-jwn-pays-121610462.html,1684671370,STORY,['JWN'],"[Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Nordstrom's shares on or after the 26th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 14th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.19 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.76 per share. Last year's total dividend payments show that Nordstrom has a trailing yield of 4.9% on the current share price of $15.44. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for Nordstrom Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Fortunately Nordstrom's payout ratio is modest, at just 50% of profit. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It distributed 25% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's positive to see that Nordstrom's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Nordstrom's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 10% a year over the previous five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Nordstrom has seen its dividend decline 3.5% per annum on average over the past 10 years, which is not great to see. While it's not great that earnings and dividends per share have fallen in recent years, we're encouraged by the fact that management has trimmed the dividend rather than risk over-committing the company in a risky attempt to maintain yields to shareholders.The Bottom LineHas Nordstrom got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share are down meaningfully, although at least the company is paying out a low and conservative percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. It's definitely not great to see earnings falling, but at least there may be some buffer before the dividend needs to be cut. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy Nordstrom today.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. For example, we've found 2 warning signs for Nordstrom that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Among major peers, only Morgan Stanley's arch rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc had less female representation, at 23%.Moreover, 80% of Morgan Stanley's top leaders in the U.S. were white, more than the others, that reported such representation at between 67% and 78%.A Morgan Stanley representative declined to comment.Mary Beth Gallagher, director of engagement for Domini Impact Investments LLC, which invests with environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations, said firms need to have a pipeline of diverse talent if they want to find diverse leaders, which would involve recruiting and career-building efforts.""The logic is to ensure you have the right people with the skills sets and decision-making authority. You need to have cultivated those leaders,"" said Gallagher.To be sure, Morgan Stanley has several women in top roles, including Chief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya. She is one of three women on its 14-member operating committee. There are four women on its 14-member board of directors and four directors who identify themselves as ethnically diverse.Story continuesAcross the financial industry, women held just 21% of services board seats, 19% of C-suite roles, and 5% of CEO jobs in 2021, according to a Deloitte study published last year.Wall Street has struggled to shake off its image as an ""old boys' club"". In recent years, however, banks have made strides on diversity as they seek to appeal to millennial workers, and under pressure from social movements like #MeToo and Black Lives Matter.A major milestone came in 2021, when Citigroup named Jane Fraser, formerly its president, as its CEO.Doug Chia, president of consulting firm Soundboard Governance, called the lack of diverse senior leaders at Morgan Stanley and other firms ""a classic pipeline problem"" because it limits the pool of candidates that companies could promote to higher jobs.""If there's a dearth of candidates, then you have got to try harder"" to attract them, he said.(Reporting by Ross Kerber in Iowa City and by Simon Jessop in London; Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Rosalba O'Brien)]"
9,b8e8d503-643d-361d-a0f6-d92efb300414,OMC,2023-05-21,Here's What To Make Of Omnicom Group's (NYSE:OMC) Decelerating Rates Of Return,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-omnicom-groups-nyse-omc-130359692.html,1684587839,STORY,['OMC'],"[If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Omnicom Group (NYSE:OMC) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Omnicom Group is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$2.0b ÷ (US$25b - US$13b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Omnicom Group has an ROCE of 17%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Media industry average of 9.4% it's much better. See our latest analysis for Omnicom Group roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Omnicom Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For Omnicom Group Tell Us?Things have been pretty stable at Omnicom Group, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Omnicom Group to be a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why Omnicom Group is paying out 39% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesOn a side note, Omnicom Group's current liabilities are still rather high at 53% of total assets. This effectively means that suppliers (or short-term creditors) are funding a large portion of the business, so just be aware that this can introduce some elements of risk. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.The Key TakeawayIn a nutshell, Omnicom Group has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Since the stock has gained an impressive 56% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Since virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Omnicom Group   (of which 1 can't be ignored!) that you should know about.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:CRM) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Salesforce Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.99bUS$7.42bUS$9.85bUS$11.8bUS$14.5bUS$18.4bUS$21.2bUS$23.6bUS$25.6bUS$27.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x26Analyst x26Analyst x25Analyst x11Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 15.21%Est @ 11.28%Est @ 8.53%Est @ 6.60% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3% US$5.5kUS$6.3kUS$7.8kUS$8.6kUS$9.7kUS$11.4kUS$12.2kUS$12.5kUS$12.6kUS$12.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$99bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$27b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.3%– 2.1%) = US$454bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$454b÷ ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$206bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$305b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$210, the company appears quite good value at a 32% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Salesforce as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.034. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for SalesforceStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

HKUST expects big changes and is already preparing for it,South China Morning Post,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chatgpt-ai-transform-education-hkust-093000205.html,1684661400,STORY,['MSFT'],"[The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) is encouraging professors to include ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (AI) models in their lesson plans, as many educators agree that the emerging tech will transform the future of education.The school has stood out among other local educators in its embrace of new and generative AI technologies, giving staff free rein to create their own guidelines for its use. It is also looking to award at least US$10 million to professors looking to develop generative AI applications within curriculums.""We want all faculty members to understand that AI is here, and it's going to have a large impact on the workforce and the skill sets that students need when they graduate,"" said Sean McMinn, director of the HKUST Centre for Education Innovation (CEI), which helps train faculty members in innovative teaching methods.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.""Students are already using it, so the question becomes, how can we leverage it for learning and encourage responsible and ethical best practices for both professors and students?""HKUST Director of the Center for Education Innovation Sean McMinn giving a workshop on the impact of ChatGPT to a group of educators. Photo: HKUST alt=HKUST Director of the Center for Education Innovation Sean McMinn giving a workshop on the impact of ChatGPT to a group of educators. Photo: HKUST&gt;According to McMinn, most professors have already allowed some class usage of generative AI, which can create content such as text, images, audio, or videos based on a variety of inputs. Thus far, that has included students using it to generate fake case studies for projects, conducting preliminary research, and having the chatbot create personalised quizzes and self-assessments.Story continuesWith ChatGPT, developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI, inaccessible from Hong Kong without a VPN connection, the Centre for Education Innovation site directs students to Poe, a service developed by Quora and launched in December 2022 that allows access to a range of AI bots built on top of large language models (LLMs) including some from OpenAI.One HKUST business professor, Joon Nak Choi, said generative AI will have a number of positive learning outcomes. He is directing one of his business ethics classes to use ChatGPT for their final essays, from helping to come up with essay topics to the actual writing of drafts.""My goal is to not only for students to familiarise themselves with using ChatGPT, but to prepare them for its successors, which will continue to become far more powerful and integrated with workflow processes.""Choi, who teaches some machine learning and AI-related courses, said he expects Microsoft 365 Copilot, launched earlier this year, to have an even bigger impact on academic work and work in general than ChatGPT.Microsoft 365 Copilot will be integrated into common everyday apps like Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Microsoft Teams, with the software already being used by 600 customers in an early access testing program.""As with many of the new technologies of the past decades, these generative AI tools will increase the sheer amount of information students can access and will enable them to perform at a higher level,"" said Choi. He added that the expectations for academic performance will rise and that students will also be responsible for learning how to avoid and correct the chatbot's biases and shortcomings.Dr. Ben Yui Bun Chan, an engineering professor at HKUST, said ChatGPT has benefited his students, particularly when it comes to projects that require research on new and complex topics.How ChatGPT can be used to generate an argumentative essay matching a basic prompt. Photo: Handout alt=How ChatGPT can be used to generate an argumentative essay matching a basic prompt. Photo: Handout&gt;""AI can quickly summarise and explain information, so students can spend less time in the research and learning stage of an assignment and more time focusing on creative problem-solving, critical thinking and strategy,"" said Chan, noting that many of his students were using it for this purpose before being instructed to.Chan said he is also allowing his classes to use generative text-to-picture AI programs like Midjourney for visual and design assignments, helping students express and visualise ideas in ways they may not have been able to do before.Higher education institutions in the city have evolved their approach to ChatGPT-like services. The University of Hong Kong (HKU) first banned ChatGPT in February, but then allowed its lecturers and staff to use ChatGPT under new guidelines released in April.The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) is allowing the new technology to be incorporated into its teaching methods, but said students would need permission from tutors before using it and that turning in assignments done with ChatGPT would constitute plagiarism.There are clear risks with the new technology. The HKUST professors stressed that while the technology has benefits, some students may learn to rely on it too much and use it as a crutch.""It's very good at completing simple assignments, but when it comes to major real-world problems, they will find that AI will not simply solve it for them directly,"" said Chan. ""It is important for them to understand the limitations of AI and then move onto figuring out how to work collectively with it.""He added that students who become overly reliant on AI to complete tasks rather than using it to enhance their capabilities, may be setting themselves up to be replaced by the tech in the workforce.In a Microsoft work trend report released this week, 69 per cent of business respondents in Hong Kong said they are worried that AI will replace their jobs. But an even bigger share - 83 per cent - said that they would assign as much work as possible to AI if it could lessen their workload and increase overall productivity.Still, professors note that AI skills should not eliminate the importance of raw knowledge for a number of academic activities, such as arithmetic and mathematics. For those activities, students benefit from the mental calculations of pen-and-paper problem-solving rather than simply searching for the answers.ChatGPT also creates a problem when it comes to traditional homework. One HKUST professor who asked not to be named said he would stop assigning common essays and worksheets due to the fact that many students may simply use AI to do the work for them.""If it's not possible to tell whether or not a student has written an assignment or what part was AI-generated, it's no longer useful,"" said McMinn, explaining that this shift could ""encourage professors to move away from exam-oriented assessments"".Examples of 'AI-proof assignments' include hands-on activities such as big, interactive projects, in-person presentations, experimentations, and personal lesson reflections, which tend to reinforce better learning behaviour anyway, McMinn added.He noted that the full effects of generative AI on education remains speculative and that it will be hard for professors to change mindsets and practices overnight. But, one way or another, the tech will demand innovation in an educational environment that has been overly stagnant for decades, he added.""It won't be a choice; the technology will force change across the education system; that's how powerful it is.""This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$363 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$305. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Parker-Hannifin's current trading price of US$333 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Parker-Hannifin’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Parker-Hannifin Is Parker-Hannifin Still Cheap?Good news, investors! Parker-Hannifin is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $416.10, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Parker-Hannifin’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Parker-Hannifin look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Parker-Hannifin's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since PH is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on PH for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy PH. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.If you'd like to know more about Parker-Hannifin as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

16,60bf1517-7d5f-3c7d-b4ea-e7c240e27634,MNST,2023-05-21,7 Sin Stocks to Spice Up Your Returns in a Gloomy World,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-sin-stocks-spice-returns-211426510.html,1684271666,STORY,"['IIPR', 'BUD', 'RICK', 'MNST', 'MCD', 'KO']","[With the prospect of an incoming recession a non-zero probability event, investors may want to consider sin stocks to buy. Put another way, these publicly traded enterprises appeal to certain base-level desires of the consumer economy. Fascinatingly, academic research shows that increased stress or another stymieing factor against mental resources can make it likelier for people to give in to certain impulses, whatever they might be. Putting two and two together, a recession could easily cause stress, thus catalyzing the demand for sin stocks to buy.As well, we don’t need a full-blown recession to see “vice” activities rise. With stubbornly high inflation, mass layoffs, and geopolitical flashpoints on Americans’ minds, some folks have every reason to take the edge off. Therefore, the below sin stocks to buy may see a rise in market value.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMcDonald’s (MCD)Source: ShutterstockAccording to the Mayo Clinic, emotional eating represents a mechanism “to suppress or soothe negative emotions, such as stress, anger, fear, boredom, sadness, and loneliness.” Major life events, perhaps a recession or just stubbornly high inflation might trigger emotional eating. Although it’s probably a coincidence, shares of McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) look quite strong so far this year.Since the Jan. opener, MCD gained 12% of equity value, making it an enticing play among sin stocks. However, more realistically, the market responded to strong fundamental news. According to The Wall Street Journal, McDonald’s CEO stated that its restaurant revamp is paying off. As evidence, net income jumped 63% in the first quarter of 2023. Cynically, though, MCD should still be one of the sin stocks to buy. As great of a business as it runs, it’s not exactly a champion of consumer health. That said, it is a champion of portfolio health. According to TipRanks, MCD ranks as a strong buy with a $317.79 upside price target.Story continuesCoca-Cola (KO)Food TrendsSource: ©iStock.com/rsi1986According to the East Bentleigh Dental Group, soft drinks “contain large quantities of sugar which, when consumed, causes a ‘rush’ that is extremely addictive and leads to even bigger cravings.” Unfortunately, medical research published by the National Institutes of Health reports that sugar-sweetened beverages increase the risk of cardiometabolic disease. Of course, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) represents public enemy number one in this regard.Awkwardly, though, KO represents one of the best sin stocks to buy. While KO hasn’t impressed on a year-to-date basis (up only 2%), it’s shown considerable momentum since late March. Financially, Coca-Cola’s strength lies in its consistent profitability. Over the past decade, it’s posted 10 years of net income. As well, its trailing-year net margin stands at 29.36%, above 96.83% of companies listed in the restaurant industry.Finally, Wall Street analysts peg KO as a consensus strong buy. This assessment breaks down as 13 buys, three holds, and significantly zero sell ratings. Also, the experts forecast an upside price target of $69.44.Monster Beverage (MNST)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buySource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comWith Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), the narrative of its ranking among sin stocks to buy runs similar to Coca-Cola above. While Monster does offer non-sugar beverages, plenty of its products offer the sweet stuff, presenting broader health concerns. However, as an energy drink, Monster also caters to an addiction-like profile. As the Cleveland Clinic states, the body can develop a tolerance regarding caffeine intake.Further, caffeine produces mild, subjective psychostimulant effects, further incentivizing its use. Should a recession materialize, more people would likely need an extra dosing of caffeine to spark these feel-good emotions. Therefore, MSNT easily ranks among the sin stocks to buy. Further, Monster enjoys stout financials. For example, it carries zero debt, affording incredible flexibility at this juncture. In addition, its Altman Z-Score pings at 28.36, indicating high fiscal stability and an extremely low risk of bankruptcy.Lastly, covering analysts peg MNST as a consensus moderate buy. However, at a price target of $60, the upside potential might be limited.Anheuser-Busch (BUD)A photo of a person pouring a beer from a tap.Source: Master1305/ShutterStock.comWith Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD), we get a twofer if you’re looking specifically for sin stocks to buy. First, on a less-controversial note, research shows that stress or the existence of negative impulses may incentivize alcohol consumption. At scale, it’s possible that recessionary forces may contribute to higher rates of imbibing, cynically boosting BUD stock.Now, for the second and more controversial component, many conservative social commentators took exception to Anheuser-Busch’s partnership with Dylan Mulvaney, known for broadcasting her gender transition on social media. CBS notes that sales of Bud Light (one of Anheuser-Busch’s brands) have continued to fall weeks after the Mulvaney fallout.Looking at the matter purely agnostically, the controversy might be a discounted opportunity for shrewd investors. Here’s my thinking: if a recession hits, do you think people will care about this silly matter? Probably not, folks would just want to get drunk. And that’s exactly what Bud Light offers, a cheap way to imbibe. Thus, BUD’s one of the sin stocks to buy should the economy struggle.RCI Hospitality (RICK)Man holding stacks of money. millionaire stocks.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAn obvious entry for sin stocks to buy, RCI Hospitality (NASDAQ:RICK) of course operates in the hospitality industry. However, it’s a type of hospitality that you don’t want to patronize online unless you want to risk an encounter with HR. Certainly, it’s a hospitality that you don’t want to charge on your company credit card. I hope you get my drift.Despite the controversial nature of RICK, it remains a top idea for sin stocks to buy. Back in 2013, CNBC published an article that mentioned business for the hospitality industry thrived. On a more psychological level, these institutions may help provide an endorphin rush to their clients. Logically, a painful recession may cause folks to get down on themselves. RCI Hospitality helps pick them back up.To be fair, it’s a tricky idea. Since the beginning of this year, RICK fell slightly more than 20% in equity value. On the positive side, though, RICK appears to be undervalued. Right now, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 13.68. As a discount to projected earnings, RCI ranks better than 79.63% of companies listed in the restaurant industry. Yeah, I suppose you can call it a restaurant.Paramount Global (PARA)A director's chair, megaphone and movie clapper are arranged in a dramatically lit room.Source: ShutterstockA terribly risky idea due to deeply disappointing earnings, Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) may also suffer lingering damage from the Hollywood writers’ strike, should the protest last longer than anticipated. In other words, PARA represents one of the most contrarian ideas among sin stocks to buy. Nevertheless, if you like attempting to catch falling knives, Paramount could be interesting.Fundamentally, the entertainment studio features a long list of horror films on its streaming service Paramount+. As well, the company carries the iconic Friday the 13th franchise starring everyone’s favorite anti-hero, Jason Voorhees. According to the Washington Post, “[o]ne brain imaging study found that watching horror movies activates threat-response brain regions such as the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and insula as if the danger were real. After this rush, many people experience an elevated mood.”It’s also possible that people can artificially generate feelings of schadenfreude when watching these films: just the perfect distraction (for some) during a recessionary cycle. Therefore, PARA might be one of the sin stocks for contrarian gamblers.Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR)Cannabis leaf on dollar bill. Cannabis StocksSource: ShutterstockGenerally speaking, people seek substances such as cannabis to mellow out and ease life’s stresses. Therefore, a recession could be a cynically wonderful catalyst for Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR). To be clear, Innovative Industrial is not a direct participant in the botanical sector. Rather, it’s a leading provider of real estate capital for the regulated cannabis industry, per its website.In full disclosure, only investors carrying iron stomachs should take a crack at IIPR. Since the Jan. opener, shares gave up nearly 29% of equity value. And in the trailing one-year period, IIPR slipped more than 47%. However, it’s possible that IIPR hit a bottom on April 26.Financially, what makes Innovative Industrial so appealing is the value proposition. According to Gurufocus, the market prices IIPR at a forward multiple of 13.36. As a discount to projected earnings, IIPR ranks better than 67.43% of companies listed in the REITs industry. Also, IIPR trades at 8.2 times free cash flow. In contrast, the sector median stands at 13.03 times. So, if you’re looking for a discount with your vice trade, IIPR could be it.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 3.1%, which is fairly typical for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Goldman Sachs Group's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. Before making this announcement, Goldman Sachs Group was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 43.2% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 28% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendGoldman Sachs Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.84 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $10.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 18% per annum over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Goldman Sachs Group has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 23% per annum. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.We Really Like Goldman Sachs Group's DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Packaging Corporation of America's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Packaging Corporation of America How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Packaging Corporation of America is:26% = US$966m ÷ US$3.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.26.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Packaging Corporation of America's Earnings Growth And 26% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Packaging Corporation of America has an impressive ROE. Further, even comparing with the industry average if 21%, the company's ROE is quite respectable. Therefore, it looks like the high ROE is what probably supported Packaging Corporation of America's modest 6.7% growth over the past five years.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Packaging Corporation of America's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 12% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is PKG worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether PKG is currently mispriced by the market.Is Packaging Corporation of America Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Packaging Corporation of America has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 48% (or a retention ratio of 52%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Additionally, Packaging Corporation of America has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 53%. Regardless, Packaging Corporation of America's ROE is speculated to decline to 18% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Packaging Corporation of America's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Large-Cap Stocks with Insider Buying.""There Are Indications That We'll Have A Better Second Half""On May 12 Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss current market trends and her outlook for the back half of 2023. Stockton thinks there is a sense of uncertainty prevailing in the market, evident through a ""consolidation phase"" across various asset classes, including stocks and bonds.Stockton noted that investors lack ""strong conviction"" regarding the direction of the market and that indicators continue to point lower, with the S&amp;P 500 failing to confirm a breakout above the 4,155 level. This is indicative of a ""near-term setback"". Additionally, Stockton thinks that going below 4,000 on the S&amp;P 500 could cause market sentiment to become more bearish, potentially leading to further downside.However, Stockton thinks ""there are indications that we'll have a better second half"", with improved ""long-term momentum buy signals"" expected. Here are some comments from Katie Stockton:""Some challenges here, nothing major, we would be interested in reevaluating and looking for buying opportunities into the next downdraft... There are a lot of stocks out there that are oversold, and to the extent that they're oversold and not breaking down, there may be some opportunity there.""Investing in the stock market involves a blend of careful analysis, risk assessment, and strategic decision-making, especially in the current market environment when there is elevated downside risk. One approach that has gained prominence over the years is mimicking insider trades and tracking where big money managers are placing their bets. Insider trading can be a powerful indicator that can provide valuable insights into a company's future prospects and can serve as a lucrative investment strategy for investors with a relatively longer-term time horizon. Corporate insiders have access to valuable information about their companies, and when they decide to buy shares on the open market, it can signal a strong vote of confidence in the future of the business.

24,54fb04ce-3ce3-39cd-91f4-2087dea5a276,LMT,2023-05-21,A Look At The Fair Value Of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-lockheed-martin-120030297.html,1684670430,STORY,['LMT'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Lockheed Martin fair value estimate is US$497Current share price of US$454 suggests Lockheed Martin is potentially trading close to its fair value Analyst price target for LMT is US$504, which is 1.5% above our fair value estimateHow far off is Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.31bUS$6.51bUS$6.42bUS$6.70bUS$6.86bUS$7.00bUS$7.15bUS$7.30bUS$7.45bUS$7.61bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x9Analyst x8Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 2.05%Est @ 2.07%Est @ 2.08%Est @ 2.09%Est @ 2.10% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% US$5.9kUS$5.7kUS$5.2kUS$5.1kUS$4.9kUS$4.6kUS$4.4kUS$4.2kUS$4.0kUS$3.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$48bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.6b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.1%) = US$155bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$155b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$78bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$126b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$454, the company appears about fair value at a 8.5% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lockheed Martin as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.844. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Lockheed MartinStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace &amp; Defense market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Findings from the Extravascular Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (EV ICD) Pivotal Study, including patients followed through an average of 17.1 months, were presented as late-breaking science at Heart Rhythm 2023 in New Orleans. The EV ICD system is investigational and not yet approved for sale or distribution in the United States.The Medtronic EV ICD system is a first-of-its-kind implantable defibrillator, designed to avoid certain risks of traditional, transvenous ICDs because its lead (thin wire) is placed outside the heart and veins, under the sternum (breastbone). The system offers anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP), pause prevention pacing, and a device similar in size, shape, and battery longevity to transvenous ICDs. Using a minimally invasive approach, the device is implanted below the left armpit (in the left mid-axillary region).""The findings from the EV ICD pivotal study confirm that this system provides the advantages of a device with the lead outside the heart, and continues to provide pause prevention pacing and anti-tachycardia pacing to avoid shocks with prolonged follow up,"" said Paul Friedman, M.D., cardiac electrophysiologist and chair of the Department of Cardiology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and principal investigator of the Extravascular ICD pivotal study. ""The EV ICD system is the first to include all of this functionality in a single extravascular device.""Story continuesStudy Results: EffectivenessThe study found that of the 299 implanted patients (average follow up 17.1±6.4 months), an estimated 6.8% (Kaplan-Meier estimate) of patients experienced appropriate therapy by 18 months, with 19 patients experiencing 80 spontaneous, appropriately treated arrhythmic episodes. Of discrete episodes treated with shock, 21/21 (100%) were successfully terminated. ATP successfully treated 35/52 episodes (67.3%). Shocks were avoided in nearly half of all spontaneous episodes because of the availability of ATP. These chronic data build on the EV ICD system's previously reported defibrillation effectiveness results at implant (98.7%).1Study Results: SafetyThe rate of freedom from major EV ICD system-or procedure-related complications through 18 months was 91.9% (Kaplan-Meier estimate). The most common major complication was lead dislodgment (10 events in nine patients) identified 0 to 120 days post-implant, predominantly related to the lead-anchoring technique. Inappropriate shocks occurred in 35 patients through all follow-up, with a rate of 10.2% (Kaplan-Meier estimate) at one year. Medtronic previously reported exceeding its safety endpoint at six months.1Also, during Heart Rhythm 2023, data were presented leveraging EV ICD pivotal study device-detected episodes, demonstrating the Medtronic proprietary algorithm designed to reduce the number of inappropriate shocks successfully withheld inappropriate therapy caused by P-wave oversensing, the most common cause of inappropriate shocks, without compromising appropriate therapy. The algorithm reduced inappropriate detection due to P-wave oversensing by 57%.Contemporary ICD Benefit: A Real-World AnalysisICDs are highly effective in providing life-saving therapy for patients at risk of sudden cardiac arrest, an electrical problem with the heart stemming from a dangerously fast heart rate (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) yet are still underutilized. At Heart Rhythm 2023, Anne B. Curtis, M.D., presented findings from a new analysis of commercially available devices showing 45% of ICD patients receive appropriate therapy for ventricular tachyarrhythmias through seven years.""Within the medical community, referral for ICD therapy is being delayed in light of newer classes of heart failure medications, but this study shows that patients do receive needed therapy from their ICDs,"" said Dr. Curtis, SUNY Distinguished Professor, Department of Medicine, Jacobs School of Medicine &amp; Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo. ""This study gives physicians a contemporary view into the real-world impact of ICDs nationwide, underscoring the importance of indicated patients receiving these potentially life-saving devices.""The analysis included real-world, de-identified data from the Medtronic CareLink™ Network from 2013 to 2022, assessing time-to-first therapy in a contemporary cohort of ICD patients. First-time ICD recipients (225,444 patients, of which 179,638 were primary prevention) implanted with a Medtronic Evera™ or Visia™ single- or dual-chamber ICD were included. The study assessed time-to-first shock, ATP therapy, and any therapy (shock or ATP) for all patients, and also by primary- and secondary-prevention indications. At seven years post-implant, the incidence of any appropriate therapy for all patients was 45%, and 43% for primary prevention patients (patients who have not previously experienced a life-threatening arrhythmia).""The expansive data on Medtronic ICDs presented at Heart Rhythm 2023 reinforce the impact these therapies have for patients at risk of life-threatening heart rhythms,"" said Alan Cheng, M.D., chief medical officer of the Cardiac Rhythm Management business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic. ""Collectively, these findings demonstrate our unparalleled commitment to providing innovative solutions that improve patient experiences and outcomes even as medical care advances.""About the EV ICD Pivotal StudyThe EV ICD Pivotal study is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, non-randomized, pre-market clinical study that assessed the safety and effectiveness of the Medtronic EV ICD system for patients at risk of sudden cardiac death. It enrolled 356 patients at 46 sites in 17 countries in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, and results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Medtronic has received CE (Conformité Européenne) Mark for the Aurora™ EV ICD system, and has secured FDA approval to conduct a Continued Access Study while the agency reviews the company's related pre-market device application.About MedtronicBold thinking.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Northrop Grumman's shares before the 26th of May to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 14th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.87 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$6.92 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Northrop Grumman has a trailing yield of 1.6% on the current share price of $443.31. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Northrop Grumman's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. View our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Northrop Grumman paid out just 21% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Over the last year it paid out 72% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's positive to see that Northrop Grumman's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Fortunately for readers, Northrop Grumman's earnings per share have been growing at 14% a year for the past five years. Northrop Grumman is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. Given the quick rate of earnings per share growth and current level of payout, there may be a chance of further dividend increases in the future.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Northrop Grumman has lifted its dividend by approximately 12% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.To Sum It UpIs Northrop Grumman an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? From a dividend perspective, we're encouraged to see that earnings per share have been growing, the company is paying out less than half of its earnings, and a bit over half its free cash flow. There's a lot to like about Northrop Grumman, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.While it's tempting to invest in Northrop Grumman for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. Our analysis shows 4 warning signs for Northrop Grumman that we strongly recommend you have a look at before investing in the company.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$137 and falling to the lows of US$121. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether International Business Machines' current trading price of US$127 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at International Business Machines’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for International Business Machines What Is International Business Machines Worth?According to my valuation model, International Business Machines seems to be fairly priced at around 6.58% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy International Business Machines today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $119.41, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. In addition to this, International Business Machines has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.What kind of growth will International Business Machines generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. International Business Machines' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in IBM’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on IBM, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing International Business Machines at this point in time. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 4 warning signs for International Business Machines (of which 1 is a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.If you are no longer interested in International Business Machines, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

A 100,000-qubit system would serve as a foundation to address some of the world's most pressing problems that even the most advanced supercomputers of today may never be able to solve.For example, such a powerful quantum system could unlock entirely new understandings of chemical reactions and the dynamics of molecular processes. In turn, this could enable researchers to help study climate change through modeling better methods to capture carbon; discover materials to build batteries for electric vehicles and energy grids towards the goal of being cleaner and more sustainable; and uncover more effective and energy-efficient fertilizers.To usher in this powerful new paradigm, a global collaboration and an activation of talent and resources across industries and research institutions is being initiated. By partnering with the University of Chicago, the University of Tokyo, and IBM's broader global ecosystem, IBM will work over the next decade to advance the underlying technologies for this system, as well as to design and build the necessary components at scale.Moving forward, IBM intends to expand these partnerships to include Argonne National Laboratory and Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory, both of which are members of the Chicago Quantum Exchange and home to two respective Department of Energy quantum hubs. Importantly, the two laboratories offer capabilities and expertise that can facilitate delivering the technologies envisaged in the race to build a quantum-centric supercomputer.Story continues""Over the past several years, IBM has been at the forefront of introducing quantum technology to the world,"" said Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO, IBM. ""We have achieved significant progress along our roadmap and mission to globally establish useful quantum technology, so much so that we can now, with our partners, truly begin to explore and develop a new class of supercomputing anchored by quantum.""""Achieving breakthroughs at scale in quantum technology requires deeply rooted and productive collaboration around the world and across a broad range of industry, academic, and government partners,"" said Paul Alivisatos, President of the University of Chicago. ""Quantum information science and technology is at a crossroad where foundational discovery and technical innovation will combine to create real breakthroughs. The University of Chicago is thrilled to partner in this endeavor.""""We expect our partnership will lead to scientific breakthroughs, acceleration of the adoption of quantum computing for the coming era, and active engagement into the critical societal challenges of humanity. We also aim to contribute to the realization of a better future society by nurturing diverse talents,"" said Dr. Teruo Fujii, the President of the University of Tokyo.Building the Blocks of Quantum-Centric SupercomputingThe plans for this quantum-centric supercomputer are expected to involve innovations at all levels of the computing stack, and encompass the convergence of the fields of quantum computing and quantum communication, as well as the seamless integration of quantum and classical workflows via the hybrid cloud.Because such a computer has never been made before, the first step will be to lay out a blueprint. The design will have to integrate classical computers and quantum computers – a challenging task to date – as well as break new ground in quantum communication and computing technology.The foundation of this system will include milestones IBM has already outlined on its Quantum Development Roadmap. This includes the ability to scale and connect growing numbers of quantum processors through quantum interconnects, as well as technology to mitigate errors to fully harness noisy yet powerful quantum processors.By the end of 2023, IBM intends to debut three cornerstones of its necessary architecture for quantum-centric supercomputers. One is the new 133-qubit 'IBM Heron' processor. This processor is a complete redesign of IBM's previous generations of quantum processors, with a new two-qubit gate to allow higher performance. It will also be compatible with future extensions to enable modular connected processors to grow the size of the computer.The second is the introduction of IBM Quantum System Two. The new flagship system is designed to be modular and flexible to introduce elements of scaling in its underlying components, including classical control electronics and high-density cryogenic wiring infrastructure. This system is targeted to be online by the end of 2023.The third is the introduction of middleware for quantum, a set of tools to run workloads on both classical and quantum processors. This includes tools for decomposing, parallel execution, and reconstructing workloads to enable efficient solutions at scale.Over the next decade, IBM plans to work with university partners and its worldwide quantum ecosystem to evolve how its quantum processors can be connected via quantum interconnects. This work will aim to enable high-efficiency, high-fidelity inter-processor quantum operations and a reliable, flexible, and affordable system component infrastructure to allow scaling to 100,000 qubits.IBM's collaboration with the University of Chicago will build upon the Chicago area's strengths in quantum research. The University of Chicago seeded the region's quantum ecosystem more than a decade ago with the decision to make quantum technology a focus of what is now the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering. Chicago has arguably become one of the leading global hubs for research in quantum technology and home to one of the largest quantum networks in the country. Scientists from the University of Chicago-headquartered Chicago Quantum Exchange, which includes Argonne National Laboratory and Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory, four universities, more than 40 industry partners, and researchers at other world-class academic institutions in the region will continue to expand the understanding and utilization of quantum technology.In conjunction with IBM, researchers at the University of Tokyo have been pushing forward on topics such as the detailed analysis of noise deep inside quantum processors, the development of efficient computation for quantum artificial intelligence, and quantum chemistry simulation with classical-quantum hybrid computations.For more about the path to a 100,000-qubit quantum-centric supercomputer, read the IBM Research blog.Statements regarding IBM's future direction and intent are subject to change or withdrawal without notice and represent goals and objectives only.About IBM IBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

If you want to see more brands in this selection, go to the Top 5 Most Popular Consumer Electronics Brands.According to Zion Industry Research, the size of the consumer electronics industry is set to increase from $1.10 trillion in 2021 to $1.70 trillion by 2028, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 7.6%. China stands out as one of the largest manufacturers of consumer electronic goods. Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant adverse impact on the industry, considering China's position as the epi-centre of the virus. Regulations regarding social distancing and the closure of businesses led to a global reduction in the sales of electronics. For example, Sony's Electronic Products and Solutions segment experienced a decline in revenue, with sales dropping from 977.4 billion yen ($7.09 billion) in the first half of 2019 to 836.5 billion yen ($6.07 billion) in the first half of 2020 due to retail stores closing down. In addition to Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), companies such as Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (005930.KS), and LG also temporarily halted production in various countries to adhere to government regulations. However, one positive trend that emerged during the pandemic was the increased adoption of remote work, which led to a surge in demand for consumer electronics, particularly computing devices.In addition to the work-from-home trend, the preference for having connected homes is supporting the expansion of the consumer electronics industry. The convenience of enhanced features, such as voice assistance, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi connectivity, has led to a growing adoption of appliances equipped with these tools. According to a Value of Video Report 2020 issued by Grabyo, 58% of streaming customers surveyed reported frequent video consumption on a Smart TV. Furthermore, AI technologies and voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and Cortana are becoming increasingly prevalent. The market growth of consumer electronics has been further boosted by the increased demand for Asian electronic products in Western countries. According to data from The Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association, the production value of computers and information terminals in Japan rose by 1251.3 billion yen ($9.07 billion) in 2019 from 1041.1 billion yen ($7.55 billion) in 2017. Additionally, the rising disposable income among the population in South-East Asian nations has led to increased consumption of home appliances. This trend is expected to drive the regional market growth in the next decade.Story continuesThe key players in the consumer electronics industry, such as Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (005930.KS), and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) are investing heavily in research and development to introduce innovative products to cater to evolving consumer preferences and technological advancements. Meanwhile, government authorities are also actively taking initiatives to support the growth of electronics within their countries. For instance, the Government of India introduced the National Electronics Policy in 2018. The policy intends to provide a framework to achieve a turnover of $400 billion through consumer electronics manufacturing by the middle of this decade. Achieving such a significant number would surely require greater adoption of modern technologies like 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, and machine learning.

Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”16.

Philips offers a wide variety of consumer electronics, including televisions, audio systems, lighting solutions, personal care tools, and household appliances.Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG) was mentioned in the Q4 2022 investor letter of Artisan Partners. Here’s what the firm said:“Shares of Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG), a health care technology company, were hurt by fears regarding the recall of its first-generation CPAP machine and the potential for legal recourse and market share losses arising in its sleep division. Adding to the company’s woes are supply chain disruptions and a worsening macro environment that will weigh on deliveries and customer installations. The stock is down more than 70%, losing more than €30 billion in market value from its April 2021 highs. The stock reaction seems excessive given the likely range of outcomes we see, so we’ve been adding to our position. The sleep division is a small part of the overall business—which we do not believe is going to zero. The company has a large installed base of medical diagnostic equipment (e.g., MRI/PET/CT/ultrasound scanners) that offers a high recurring stream of software-like maintenance revenues. This is a sticky business as medical providers are reluctant to switch over to competitors. We appreciate that until there is greater clarity on the full impact of the recall and how long it may take to resolve, the stock will remain under pressure, but we believe today’s asking price offers the potential for highly attractive multi-year returns.”6.

But that doesn't change the fact that shareholders have received really good returns over the last five years. In fact, the share price is 114% higher today. Generally speaking the long term returns will give you a better idea of business quality than short periods can. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price.While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. View our latest analysis for Target In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Target achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 1.6% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 16% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Target's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Target, it has a TSR of 140% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveTarget shareholders are up 0.5% for the year (even including dividends). But that was short of the market average. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 19% over five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

36,8c11b92d-b15d-377b-80f7-4f684d73dd40,TGT,2023-05-21,A Target employee says she only got a measly 2% raise — after 5 years of working there. How to keep up with inflation even if your paycheck hasn't,MoneyWise,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-employee-says-she-only-163000925.html,1684600200,STORY,['TGT'],"[A Target employee says she only got a measly 2% raise — after 5 years of working there. How to keep up with inflation even if your paycheck hasn'tEmployees of retail giant Target have turned to TikTok, Reddit and other social media platforms to raise awareness and find solidarity among other cash-strapped colleagues about pay raises they say miss the mark.In a viral TikTok clip published in April, Kaitlin Sondae, who says she’s worked at Target for five years, details her most recent hourly pay raise.“I was making $15.61. Now I make $15.92 — it’s a 2% raise, and I got 31 cents,” Sondae said, before letting out a sarcastic “Yay!” about the extra $12.40 she could earn in a 40-hour work week.That amount of money won’t go far in today’s inflationary, high-interest-rate environment. If you’re in the same boat as Sondae and your paycheck is failing to meet your needs, there are several things you can do to attempt to breach that financial gap.Retail woesSondae regularly posts TikTok videos about her experiences working at Target — including one, where she thought it would be “funny” to share details of the miniscule pay raises she’s had in the past five years.“It’s kind of sad,” she told viewers while displaying her previous tiny raises of 0.9%, 1% and 2% — with two of those raises apparently being wiped out following store-wide pay bumps.“Yes, it could be better, but it’s also Target, so it is what it is at this point,” she said before adding another unenthusiastic “Yay!”Sondae’s experience is by no means alien to retail workers. A trend on social media has seen employees blasting their measly pay bumps.The first video mentioned was featured in another viral TikTok clip where a former retail worker named Sydney says she started working at $10 an hour in 2016 — and never made it above $11 after four years.Sydney’s clip drew lots of comments, including one from somebody who said they once received a three-cent raise to their hourly wage, adding: “I honestly would have been less insulted with no raise at all.”The big problem with these small wage increases is they’re not keeping up with inflation. The annual inflation rate in 2022 was 6.5% — significantly higher than the 2% raise Sondae was complaining about.Story continuesIt is common for companies to offer cost-of-living adjustments to ensure employee wages keep up with inflation, but they are not obligated to do so.Target announced plans last year to set a new starting wage range from $15 to $24 for hourly team members. However, the retail giant said the exact starting wage would “depend on the job and the local market.”Regardless, that policy would guarantee Target workers are paid over double the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour (although minimum wages do vary by state).There are multiple issues at play here. The federal minimum wage hasn’t kept up with the cost of living, and low hourly pay raises each year are unlikely to make up the difference. Here’s how you can keep up with inflation even if your paycheck hasn’t.Boost your incomeThere are multiple ways you can supplement your income. For instance, you could look for a new job that offers a higher pay rate.If you don’t want to change jobs but do want to boost your income, consider asking for additional shifts or more responsibilities. Understand that this may require extra training for you to advance into a higher-paying position.You might also consider taking on a side hustle (if you have the time). Working two or more jobs is more common than ever in America. According to the job-search site Zippia, 45% of working Americans have a side hustle in 2023 and they spend an average of 13 hours per week doing it.You could also earn some extra income by selling unused or unwanted items online — perhaps you have clothes or gadgets you can sell — but if you plan to start doing that this year, make sure you understand the new tax rules about selling items online.Renting out some space, like a room in your home or even a parking spot, is another way to generate some cash flow. Or you could get a housemate who can split some of your housing costs.There are many ways to boost your income. How you manage your money will determine if you’re able to keep up with — or at least get closer to — the inflation rate.Manage your moneyOnce you boost your income, what you do with your money is really important.First, consider creating and sticking to a budget that breaks down your monthly income between necessities, wants and savings.Try to avoid common financial mistakes — such as using credit cards to pay for things you cannot afford or getting loans that you’ll struggle to pay back.If you wrack up too much high-interest debt on your credit card or your car loan, you could fall behind on your payments, be subject to financial penalties, and your balance can quickly spiral out of control.That can damage your credit score and leave you in poor standing if you need to borrow more money — which you may if your paycheck falls flat of inflation.If you reach the end of month, you’ve covered your debts and have any money left over, you might consider stashing it away in a high-yield savings account, which will give the funds you deposit the chance to grow.Alternatively, you may want to invest your spare change to generate passive income through dividends — but remember that investing also comes with risk.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

If you want to see more brands in this selection, go to the Top 5 Most Popular Consumer Electronics Brands.According to Zion Industry Research, the size of the consumer electronics industry is set to increase from $1.10 trillion in 2021 to $1.70 trillion by 2028, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 7.6%. China stands out as one of the largest manufacturers of consumer electronic goods. Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant adverse impact on the industry, considering China's position as the epi-centre of the virus. Regulations regarding social distancing and the closure of businesses led to a global reduction in the sales of electronics. For example, Sony's Electronic Products and Solutions segment experienced a decline in revenue, with sales dropping from 977.4 billion yen ($7.09 billion) in the first half of 2019 to 836.5 billion yen ($6.07 billion) in the first half of 2020 due to retail stores closing down. In addition to Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), companies such as Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (005930.KS), and LG also temporarily halted production in various countries to adhere to government regulations. However, one positive trend that emerged during the pandemic was the increased adoption of remote work, which led to a surge in demand for consumer electronics, particularly computing devices.In addition to the work-from-home trend, the preference for having connected homes is supporting the expansion of the consumer electronics industry. The convenience of enhanced features, such as voice assistance, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi connectivity, has led to a growing adoption of appliances equipped with these tools. According to a Value of Video Report 2020 issued by Grabyo, 58% of streaming customers surveyed reported frequent video consumption on a Smart TV. Furthermore, AI technologies and voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and Cortana are becoming increasingly prevalent. The market growth of consumer electronics has been further boosted by the increased demand for Asian electronic products in Western countries. According to data from The Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association, the production value of computers and information terminals in Japan rose by 1251.3 billion yen ($9.07 billion) in 2019 from 1041.1 billion yen ($7.55 billion) in 2017. Additionally, the rising disposable income among the population in South-East Asian nations has led to increased consumption of home appliances. This trend is expected to drive the regional market growth in the next decade.Story continuesThe key players in the consumer electronics industry, such as Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (005930.KS), and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) are investing heavily in research and development to introduce innovative products to cater to evolving consumer preferences and technological advancements. Meanwhile, government authorities are also actively taking initiatives to support the growth of electronics within their countries. For instance, the Government of India introduced the National Electronics Policy in 2018. The policy intends to provide a framework to achieve a turnover of $400 billion through consumer electronics manufacturing by the middle of this decade. Achieving such a significant number would surely require greater adoption of modern technologies like 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, and machine learning.

Here’s what the firm said:“Shares of Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG), a health care technology company, were hurt by fears regarding the recall of its first-generation CPAP machine and the potential for legal recourse and market share losses arising in its sleep division. Adding to the company’s woes are supply chain disruptions and a worsening macro environment that will weigh on deliveries and customer installations. The stock is down more than 70%, losing more than €30 billion in market value from its April 2021 highs. The stock reaction seems excessive given the likely range of outcomes we see, so we’ve been adding to our position. The sleep division is a small part of the overall business—which we do not believe is going to zero. The company has a large installed base of medical diagnostic equipment (e.g., MRI/PET/CT/ultrasound scanners) that offers a high recurring stream of software-like maintenance revenues. This is a sticky business as medical providers are reluctant to switch over to competitors. We appreciate that until there is greater clarity on the full impact of the recall and how long it may take to resolve, the stock will remain under pressure, but we believe today’s asking price offers the potential for highly attractive multi-year returns.”6.

Opponents labeled the measure the ""don't say gay"" law.The company alleged DeSantis rallied the Republican-controlled legislature to strike back at ""woke Disney"" and seize control of an administrative district, created in 1967, that helped Disney develop theme parks and resorts. The district, originally known as Reedy Creek Improvement District, was also named as a defendant.DeSantis' lawyers argued on Friday that the judge overseeing that case demonstrated potential partiality while handling separate cases in which the judge mentioned Disney as an example of state retaliation.Considering Walker's statements, ""the court's impartiality in this matter might reasonably be questioned,"" DeSantis' lawyers said in the their motion.DeSantis is expected to jump in to the Republican presidential nomination contest in the coming days and could be a potentially tough challenger to front-runner Donald Trump. The eventual Republican nominee is expected to challenge President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in November 2024.(Reporting by Jason Lange in Washington; Editing by Matthew Lewis)]"

(AP) — Gov. Ron DeSantis is asking that a federal judge be disqualified from the First Amendment lawsuit filed by Disney against the Florida governor and his appointees, claiming the jurist's prior statements in other cases have raised questions about his impartiality on the state's efforts to take over Disney World's governing body.DeSantis ' attorney filed a motion in federal court in Tallahassee on Friday seeking to disqualify Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker from overseeing the lawsuit filed by Disney last month. The lawsuit alleges that DeSantis and his appointees violated the company's right to free speech, as well as the contracts clause, by taking over the special governing district that previously had been controlled by Disney supporters after Disney opposed Florida legislation that critics have dubbed “Don't Say Gay.”The Republican governor's motion was filed a day after Disney announced that it was scrapping plans to build a new campus in central Florida and relocate 2,000 employees from Southern California to work in digital technology, finance and product development, amid an ongoing feud with DeSantis.DeSantis' motion said Walker referenced the ongoing dispute between his administration and Disney during hearings in two unrelated lawsuits before him dealing with free speech issues and fear of retaliation for violating new laws championed by DeSantis and Republican lawmakers. One of those was a First Amendment lawsuit filed by Florida professors that challenged a new law establishing a survey about “intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity” on state campuses.Walker, who was nominated to the federal bench in 2012 by President Barack Obama and is now chief judge of the district, tossed out that lawsuit on the grounds that the professors didn't have standing to challenge the law championed by DeSantis and Florida lawmakers.In the first case, Walker said, “What’s in the record, for example — is there anything in the record that says we are now going to take away Disney’s special status because they’re woke?""Story continuesIn the second case, the judge said, “And then Disney is going to lose its status because—arguably, because they made a statement that run afoul—ran afoul of state policy of the controlling party,” according to the DeSantis motion.Disney and DeSantis have been engaged in a tug-of-war for more than a year that has engulfed the GOP governor in criticism as he prepares to launch an expected presidential bid next week.The feud started after Disney, in the face of significant pressure, publicly opposed the state concerning lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades that critics called “Don’t Say Gay.”As punishment, DeSantis took over Disney World’s self-governing district through legislation passed by lawmakers and appointed a new board of supervisors. Before the new board came in, the company signed agreements with the old board stripping the new supervisors of design and construction authority.In response, the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature passed legislation allowing the DeSantis-appointed board to repeal those agreements and made the theme park resort’s monorail system subject to state inspection, when it previously had been done in-house.Disney filed the First Amendment lawsuit against the Florida governor and the DeSantis-appointed board last month in federal court in Tallahassee, and it landed in Walker's court. The DeSantis-appointed board earlier this month sued Disney in state court in Orlando seeking to void the deals the company made with the previous board.The creation of Disney’s self-governing district by the Florida Legislature was instrumental in the company’s decision in the 1960s to build near Orlando. Disney told the state at the time that it planned to build a futuristic city that would include a transit system and urban planning innovations, so the company needed autonomy. The futuristic city never materialized, however, and instead morphed into a second theme park that opened in 1982.___This story has been corrected to reflect that Disney filed the First Amendment lawsuit against the Florida governor and the DeSantis-appointed board, not a Disney-appointed board; and that the DeSantis-appointed board, not a Disney-appointed board, earlier this month sued Disney in state court in Orlando.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP]"

Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. But Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 30% over five years, which is below the market return. Unfortunately the share price is down 2.0% in the last year.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Comcast In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Comcast actually saw its EPS drop 23% per year.Essentially, it doesn't seem likely that investors are focused on EPS. Because earnings per share don't seem to match up with the share price, we'll take a look at other metrics instead.On the other hand, Comcast's revenue is growing nicely, at a compound rate of 6.2% over the last five years. In that case, the company may be sacrificing current earnings per share to drive growth.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthComcast is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Comcast the TSR over the last 5 years was 45%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveComcast shareholders gained a total return of 1.1% during the year. But that was short of the market average. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 8% per year for five years. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Comcast , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But note: Comcast may not be the best stock to buy.

(NYSE:PX) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Therefore, if you purchase P10's shares on or after the 26th of May, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 20th of June.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.033 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.12 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that P10 has a trailing yield of 1.1% on the current share price of $10.74. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether P10's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether P10 can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for P10 Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. That's why it's good to see P10 paying out a modest 48% of its earnings.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That's why it's comforting to see P10's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 68% per annum for the past five years.Story continuesUnfortunately P10 has only been paying a dividend for a year or so, so there's not much of a history to draw insight from.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid P10? When companies are growing rapidly and retaining a majority of the profits within the business, it's usually a sign that reinvesting earnings creates more value than paying dividends to shareholders. Perhaps even more importantly - this can sometimes signal management is focused on the long term future of the business. Overall, P10 looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.So while P10 looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for P10 you should be aware of.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Aimed at cultivating a more robust and highly-skilled semiconductor workforce for the two countries, the partnership will drive emerging research while increasing the pipeline of students studying a semiconductor curriculum. U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Japanese Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Keiko Nagaoka presided over the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU), marking a step forward in advancing U.S.-Japan technological competitiveness and resilience.UPWARDS for the Future, established by Micron and other industry partners, brings together 11 universities from across the U.S. and Japan to develop leading semiconductor curricula, creating opportunities for cross-collaboration. The founding universities are known for their high-quality education and proven commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) and closing the gender equity gap in STEM, which is crucial to building the industry’s workforce of the future.Growing the STEM talent pipeline requires reaching groups that are underrepresented in the semiconductor industry today. UPWARDS for the Future intends to establish pathways into higher education and facilitate new programs dedicated to attracting and retaining those historically underrepresented groups, in addition to supporting the efforts partner institutions have undertaken to date.“Leading in next-generation technologies requires developing a next-generation workforce,” said Rahm Emanuel, United States Ambassador to Japan. “Semiconductors are critical to our economy and to our security, and the UPWARDS for the Future program will enable the United States and Japan, as allies and economic partners, to build that workforce.”Story continuesMore than $60 million in contributions over the next five years from a variety of sources, including Micron and its partners, will go towards supporting the launch and implementation of this innovative program, which deepens ties between industry and higher education across the U.S. and Japan. The network, expected to impact approximately 5,000 students per year, will provide access to experiential learning in cleanrooms and memory-related research across institutions, with a particular focus on promoting opportunities for female students, staff and leaders.“UPWARDS for the Future reflects Micron’s long-term commitment to strengthening the semiconductor ecosystems in the U.S. and Japan. Building and sustaining advanced memory semiconductor leadership requires a robust workforce from diverse backgrounds,” said Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. “Micron is proud to be at the forefront of this once-in-a-generation opportunity to unite leading educational institutions and foster greater technology innovation.”Over the past five years, Micron has increased representation of women globally, with female representation at Micron Japan increasing by 56% in recent years. The company continues to increase its number of female inventors. More than 22% of the original patent applications Micron filed in fiscal year 2022 named a woman as an inventor. In February 2023, Micron Japan was named on Great Place to Work® Institute’s 2023 Best Workplaces in Japan list for the third consecutive year, and especially recognized for engaging its team members and embracing a culture of inclusion and innovation.Technology innovation and leadership remain the cornerstone of Micron’s business success. The company has contributed to more than 53,000 patents over its lifetime. In 2022, Micron was granted over 3,000 patents – averaging more than eight patent grants per day. This past week, Micron announced that it will be the first semiconductor company to put extreme ultraviolet patterning technology into production in Japan with its Hiroshima fab playing a critical role in the company’s development of its next-generation of DRAM, the 1-gamma (1γ) node.Micron’s multiple sites in Japan are central to its research and development roadmap for the company’s cutting-edge DRAM technology across its product lines. Micron has invested over $13 billion in Japan since 2013. With more than 4,000 engineers and technicians across the country, Micron is committed to workforce development and ensuring Japan’s continued economic growth and prosperity. Micron has hired more than 1,500 new employees nationwide over the past five years to facilitate the production of nearly 10% of the world’s DRAM supply from Micron’s Hiroshima fab.Quotes from Partners:“Partnerships like these will help the U.S. and its allies keep pace with a changing global innovation landscape, and combined with NSF’s other recent investments in semiconductor research and workforce development, keep us in the vanguard of global competitiveness. The diversity of the science and engineering workforce on a global scale is not only the right thing to do, but also necessary, as global competition for talent is fierce and investing in a broad demographic of the population is the only way we can accelerate progress and tackle the global shortage of semiconductor workers.”- NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan“Boise State takes great pride in its long-standing partnership with Micron in business and engineering, as well as in our materials science, cybersecurity, and computer science and workforce development programs. In this critical moment, we are excited to step forward to advance innovation, security, and economic prosperity by joining with a select group of top universities in the U.S. and Japan in an effort to support semiconductor leadership and advance our national interests. The University Partnership for Workforce Advancement and Research &amp; Development in Semiconductors (UPWARDS) for the Future initiative will make a significant impact for Idaho, the nation, and the world.”- Boise State University President Marlene Tromp“Hiroshima University, as one of Japan’s oldest centers of excellence for semiconductor research, has fostered a large number of engineers over the last 40 years for Hiroshima’s high-tech industry cluster, where Micron’s cutting-edge fab is at the core. This U.S.-Japan partnership is an important strategic project for our university, as it aims to further education and the talent pipeline and strengthen R&amp;D in the semiconductor field. Increasing the number of female engineers is a core element of this partnership, contributing to the diversification and advancement of the semiconductor workforce. We are very excited about this collaboration and honored to contribute towards the economic security alliance among U.S. and Japan universities under UPWARDS for the Future.”- Hiroshima University President Mitsuo Ochi“It is an immense pleasure and honor for Kyushu University to become part of this remarkable initiative, UPWARDS for the Future. In our daily lives, semiconductors play an indispensable role, and the development of people through education is crucial. As universities, we bear the responsibility of creating and sharing knowledge to shape the workforce of tomorrow.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for McDonald's McDonald's Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP &amp; CFO, Ian Borden, sold US$2.0m worth of shares at a price of US$256 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$296. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was 53% of Ian Borden's stake.In the last year McDonald's insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.McDonald's Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at McDonald's. In total, insiders dumped US$1.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of McDonald'sLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that McDonald's insiders own 0.04% of the company, worth about US$93m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.What Might The Insider Transactions At McDonald's Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought McDonald's stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. Insiders own shares, but we're still pretty cautious, given the history of sales. We're in no rush to buy! In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing McDonald's. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for McDonald's that deserve your attention before buying any shares.But note: McDonald's may not be the best stock to buy.

This will take the dividend yield to an attractive 2.8%, providing a nice boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Robert Half International Robert Half International's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. However, prior to this announcement, Robert Half International's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 17.0%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 30% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendRobert Half International Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.60 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.92. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 12% a year over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that Robert Half International has grown earnings per share at 18% per year over the past five years. Robert Half International definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.We Really Like Robert Half International's DividendOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Robert Half International is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.

52,18d3c026-2f39-3194-92e3-7fe6169faaaa,UPS,2023-05-21,United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) Seems To Use Debt Quite Sensibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-parcel-nyse-ups-seems-130018011.html,1684587618,STORY,['UPS'],"[Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service What Is United Parcel Service's Debt?As you can see below, United Parcel Service had US$21.8b of debt, at March 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$9.40b, its net debt is less, at about US$12.4b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is United Parcel Service's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, United Parcel Service had liabilities of US$16.3b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$35.9b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of US$9.40b and US$10.6b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$32.2b.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since United Parcel Service has a huge market capitalization of US$146.8b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.United Parcel Service has net debt of just 0.77 times EBITDA, suggesting it could ramp leverage without breaking a sweat. But the really cool thing is that it actually managed to receive more interest than it paid, over the last year. So it's fair to say it can handle debt like a hotshot teppanyaki chef handles cooking. But the other side of the story is that United Parcel Service saw its EBIT decline by 4.4% over the last year. If earnings continue to decline at that rate the company may have increasing difficulty managing its debt load. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if United Parcel Service can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, United Parcel Service produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 69% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewUnited Parcel Service's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its EBIT growth rate. All these things considered, it appears that United Parcel Service can comfortably handle its current debt levels. On the plus side, this leverage can boost shareholder returns, but the potential downside is more risk of loss, so it's worth monitoring the balance sheet. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with United Parcel Service , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

As always, quarterly earnings continue to move individual stocks higher and lower.In the current environment, some stocks are surging and have more than doubled their share price year to date, while other stocks continue to languish or move at a snail’s pace. However, many of the stocks that remain depressed are of exceptional companies and household names. In some case, the slumping share price is not the fault of management but rather of outside forces beyond their control. Investors should be attuned to these bruised and battered stocks because they present great long-term opportunities.Here are three beaten-down stocks with 100% upside potential.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmerican Express (AXP)the American Express logo etched into woodSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.comWhile it’s mostly known for its credit cards, American Express (NYSE:AXP) is technically among the 20 biggest banks in the U.S. based on its asset size of $138 billion. This fact has led the company’s stock price to be dragged lower amid the regional banking crisis that has gripped markets since March. AXP stock has declined 18% since February of this year when rumblings of trouble in the banking sector first emerged. However, this is a case of American Express being dragged lower by a sector downturn. Fundamentally, the credit card issuer remains fine.In time, AXP stock is sure to recover as worries about banks subside and investors realize that American Express shares are undervalued. The company also continues to report decent quarterly earnings that do not justify the selloff in its stock. At the end of April, American Express reported record Q1 revenues of $14.3 billion, an increase of 22% from a year earlier and reaffirmed its guidance for this year of revenue growth in a range of 15% to 17%. AXP stock is currently trading more than 20% below the consensus forecast of analysts.Story continuesWalt Disney Co. (DIS)Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.Source: chrisdorney / ShutterstockThings have gone from bad to worse at Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) following its latest earnings print. This presents a buying opportunity for long-term investors. DIS stock has fallen 10% since the company reported its results on May 10. The company’s share price is nearly 30% below its 52-week high and sinking. While this might raise stress levels in the near-term, it sets up investors who buy the stock now for big future gains.The latest disappointment for Disney shareholders came with the revelation that the company lost four million subscribers at its Disney+ streaming service this year’s first quarter. Overlooked in the current selloff is the fact that other areas of Disney’s business were strong in the quarter, notably its theme parks and theatrically released films. Also, the majority of the subscription losses at Disney+ occurred in India, which is a much smaller market than North America and Europe for the company.And, the company reported higher subscription revenue at Disney+, where average revenue per user rose 20% to $7.14 among subscribers in the U.S. and Canada. Disney CEO Bob Iger is undertaking a broad restructuring of the company that has included 7,000 job cuts. In time, the changes and cost control measures being initiated will bear fruit and DIS stock will rise. Patience is required.Amazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comAnother company whose stock has been depressed as it restructures coming out of the pandemic is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The e-commerce giant has seen its share price fall 40% from an all-time high reached in July 2021 when Covid-19 was still raging and people were forced to shop almost exclusively online. Despite a tentative recovery, AMZN stock remains 25% below its 52-week high and continues to trail the gains seen in other mega-cap tech stocks.The lackluster performance comes as Amazon downsizes its e-commerce and delivery operations after overbuilding during the Covid-19 crisis, closing warehouses and fulfillment centers, laying off more than 25,000 workers, and canceling major projects. The restructuring is taking time but starting to pay off. Amazon recently announced better-than-expected first-quarter earnings driven, in large part, by continued strength in its cloud computing business.The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of 31 cents compared to a consensus forecast of 21 cents expected on Wall Street. Revenue totaled $127.4 billion versus $124.5 billion that was expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv data. Online advertising also showed strength in the quarter, coming in at $9.5 billion compared to $9.1 billion that was forecast.

These are companies at the forefront of a burgeoning trend that look poised to run away with a large slice of the growing market share. A good first place to look is at the population as a whole. Unfortunately, we’re getting older and more unhealthy. The WHO estimates that 1 in 6 people will be over 60 by 2030. By 2050, the proportion of the population that’s over 60 will have almost doubled t0 22% from 2015 levels. It’s an undeniable opportunity for the healthcare market, and one that’s compounded by the growing obesity epidemic. By 2035, over half of the global population is expected to be overweight or obese. This condition is expected to cost about $4.32 billion annually, or about 3% of global GDP.That makes healthcare and pharmaceutical drug makers a good first place to start your search. While treating obesity is going to be a top priority, managing the conditions that stem from it will also be a big business. There’s an undisputed link between obesity and cancer, and with the rising average age, cancer drugs will be in demand. Joint replacement is another market worth watching — it’s expected to grow rapidly over the next few years as aging and obesity takes a tole on the public’s bodies. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSwitching gears from healthcare, technology is another obvious place to look for the best stocks for the future. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been gaining momentum with the advent of ChatGPT and its competitors. But machine learning is set to become much bigger than just a chat bot that knows it all. It’s a market that’s expected to grow at nearly 40% per year through 2030, offering a great investment opportunity. Zimmer Biomet (ZBI)Various graphical representations of medical imagery are shown in front of a doctor using a tablet computer. DNA stockSource: Shutterstock / PopTikaZimmer Biomet (NYSE:ZBH) specializes in large-joint reconstruction, meaning things like hips and knees. The past few years have been a challenge for Zimmer as it struggled with inventory issues and quality control. But with new management at the helm the group appears to be in a strong position to ride the wave of new demand well into the future. Story continuesZimmer has been working to build out its portfolio of complementary procedures in order to capitalize on the savings and synergies between its businesses. Strategic acquisitions together with deft management have put the group in a strong position to drive growth and improve profitability. This strategy is starting to bear fruit as the group boosted its 2023 earnings guidance in the first quarter after posting revenue growth across all categories in the first quarter. Zimmer should be able to hold on to its strong position in the industry even as it grows, though there are some risks to be mindful of. Right now, surgeons themselves tend to be the main decision makers when it comes to the brands they use. But this could start to change as healthcare reform takes hold and hospitals look to streamline their costs. Given Zimmer already has a stronghold on the market, the group should be able to adapt to the changing landscape.Roche Holding (RHHBY)A Roche (RHHBY) sign outside of a company office in Belmont, CaliforniaSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comPlenty of stocks are reshaping the future in the pharmaceutical sector, such as Swiss healthcare giant Roche Holding (OTCMKTS:RHHBY). The group has a strong track-record of revenue growth and its pipeline looks promising for the years ahead. However, Roche shares are depressed as the market digests the impact of lower Covid-19 diagnostic sales and failed trial results. But this could make for an attractive entry point for long-term investors. The group’s Covid-related demand losses are expected to be offset by growth in two new treatments to address lymphoma. Roche’s existing portfolio is heavy on oncology drugs and its pipeline follows a similar trajectory. It’s got 47 drugs in Phase 3 trials, suggesting there could be new revenue streams online in the near future.Thomas Schinecker has taken over as CEO at Roche, and he’s overseeing the transition to a more efficient organization. This should accelerate the pace of change at Roche, allowing the firm to squeeze more out of its promising pipeline.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the OG when it comes to stocks reshaping the future. There will likely be a lag before its next big project has a real impact, but that shouldn’t stop long-term investors from picking up the stock now. The group is made up of an enviable mishmash of strong businesses— from the software that people use everyday to its growing cloud arm.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Therefore, if you purchase Tractor Supply's shares on or after the 26th of May, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 13th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.03 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$4.12 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Tractor Supply has a trailing yield of approximately 1.8% on its current stock price of $224.23. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Tractor Supply Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Fortunately Tractor Supply's payout ratio is modest, at just 39% of profit. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Over the last year, it paid out more than three-quarters (84%) of its free cash flow generated, which is fairly high and may be starting to limit reinvestment in the business.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see Tractor Supply has grown its earnings rapidly, up 24% a year for the past five years.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Tractor Supply has delivered 26% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.Final TakeawayIs Tractor Supply worth buying for its dividend? From a dividend perspective, we're encouraged to see that earnings per share have been growing, the company is paying out less than half of its earnings, and a bit over half its free cash flow. There's a lot to like about Tractor Supply, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.While it's tempting to invest in Tractor Supply for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. For example, we've found 3 warning signs for Tractor Supply (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that deserve your attention before investing in the shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

All data were presented at Heart Rhythm 2023, the annual meeting of the Heart Rhythm Society, held in New Orleans from May 19-21.Boston Scientific Corporation (PRNewsFoto/Boston Scientific Corporation) (PRNewsFoto/Boston Scientific Corporation)Real-world outcomes from the EU-PORIA registry of the FARAPULSE™ Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) SystemReal-world outcomes from the multi-center EU-PORIA registry were highlighted in a late-breaking data presentation, further demonstrating the safety, efficacy and learning curve characteristics of the FARAPULSE PFA System. The registry data included favorable single procedure success rates, along with efficient procedure times in a broad patient population. More than 1,200 patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation (AF)** were enrolled and treated at seven high-volume European centers.Key findings from the registry:Rates of freedom from recurrence of AF and atrial tachycardia were high at 74.0% per the Kaplan-Meier estimate at a median follow-up of one year. The freedom from recurrence rate was 80.0% in patients with paroxysmal AF and 66.0% in patients with persistent AF.Level of physician experience with AF ablation did not impact procedure times or patient outcomes, reinforcing the procedural reproducibility of the FARAPULSE PFA System.Data demonstrated a predictable workflow with a median of 58 minutes within an interquartile range of 40 to 87 minutes.There was a 1.7% major complication rate and 1.9% minor complication rate with no reported esophageal damage or pulmonary vein stenosis and a single case of sustained phrenic nerve palsy, which was reported in the MANIFEST PF study.Story continuesPrimary results of the FROZEN-AF IDE trial with the POLARx™ Cryoablation SystemResults from the global, prospective, non-randomized, single-arm FROZEN-AF IDE study of the POLARx Cryoablation System met the safety and effectiveness endpoints of the trial. The study, which examined use of the device for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal, or intermittent atrial fibrillation (AF), included an extension arm for the POLARx FIT Cryoballoon Catheter, a single device capable of enabling 28 and 31mm sizes. The extension arm sub-study also achieved its safety and effectiveness endpoints and included 50 patients who were treated with at least one application of the 31mm cryoballoon and will be followed for 12 months. At the time of data release, patients had undergone six out of a total of 12 months of follow up.Key findings from the trial:The primary safety endpoint of composite acute and chronic primary safety events through 12 months was achieved with an event-free rate of 96.3% at 12 months in the IDE trial and 100% at six months in the extension arm of the study.There were no reports of moderate or severe pulmonary vein stenosis, persistent phrenic nerve palsy or esophageal fistulas in either patient cohort.The rate of freedom from documented atrial arrhythmias was 79.9% at 12 months in the IDE trial and 88.0% at six months in the extension arm.Effects of the EMBLEM MRI™ Subcutaneous Implantable Defibrillator (S-ICD) on tricuspid regurgitationData from a secondary analysis of the investigator-sponsored, randomized ATLAS trial compared among nearly 450 patients the severity of tricuspid regurgitation at six months following the implantation of a transvenous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (TV-ICD) versus the EMBLEM MRI S-ICD. Tricuspid regurgitation is a disease that occurs when the tricuspid valve does not close properly and is a risk factor for heart failure.Key findings from the analysis:At six months, patients in the TV-ICD group were seven times more likely to have worsening tricuspid regurgitation.Of those with worsening tricuspid regurgitation, moderate or severe symptoms developed in 6.9% of patients receiving a TV-ICD versus 2.3% of those receiving an S-ICD.Hybrid strategy for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death using ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation and the EMBLEM MRI S-ICDThe prospective, investigator-sponsored VTabl-SICD trial explored among 32 patients the safety and efficacy of a novel hybrid management strategy combining VT ablation with S-ICD implantation in patients who have scar-related VT. Findings from the study suggested that the combination strategy was superior to conventional TV-ICD implantation for the secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death by significantly reducing the need to deliver ICD therapy and avoiding untreated, symptomatic arrhythmias.At two years, the rate of delivery of any appropriate ICD therapy was significantly lower in the VTabl-S-ICD group compared to the TV-ICD group.There were no cases of untreated symptomatic VT or ventricular fibrillation in the VTabl-S-ICD group.Notable developments for the WATCHMAN FLX LAAC Device Data presented from two new sub-analyses of the SURPASS study out of the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) LAAO Registry provided insights into real-world treatment strategies with the WATCHMAN FLX LAAC Device. The first analysis assessed outcomes with different post-procedural antithrombotic therapies and demonstrated that patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) alone had the lowest risk of major adverse events in comparison to other drug regimens following the implant. The second analysis demonstrated that concomitant catheter ablation and LAAC with the WATCHMAN FLX device was safe and had similar outcomes when compared to device implantation alone.In addition, the latest preclinical data for the investigational WATCHMAN FLX Pro LAAC Device demonstrated that its new thromboresistant coating may further reduce the risk of device-related thrombus and result in faster and more uniform tissue coverage on the device at 45 days post implant. The findings were also published in JACC Clinical Electrophysiology.""The data shared at this year's Heart Rhythm meeting showcases the breadth and depth of our cardiology therapies, which spans from diagnosis to treatment of cardiac disease, and highlights the continued growth of our portfolio,"" said Kenneth Stein, M.D., senior vice president and global chief medical officer, Boston Scientific. ""From preclinical data to real-world surveillance, data demonstrated positive outcomes for our FARAPULSE PFA System, the POLARx Cryoablation System, the EMBLEM S-ICD System as well as our WATCHMAN FLX LAAC device, and is evidence of our commitment to providing physicians with innovative technologies that make a meaningful impact on the lives of patients living with heart disease.""About Boston ScientificBoston Scientific transforms lives through innovative medical solutions that improve the health of patients around the world.

(NASDAQ:PEP) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $1.26 on the 30th of June, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This takes the annual payment to 2.6% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for PepsiCo PepsiCo's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Prior to this announcement, the company was paying out 96% of what it was earning. It will be difficult to sustain this level of payout so we wouldn't be confident about this continuing.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 79.2% over the next year. Under the assumption that the dividend will continue along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 59% which would be quite comfortable going to take the dividend forward.historic-dividendPepsiCo Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $2.15 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $5.06. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 8.9% over that duration. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.There Isn't Much Room To Grow The DividendInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. PepsiCo has impressed us by growing EPS at 6.9% per year over the past five years. However, the company isn't reinvesting a lot back into the business, so we would expect the growth rate to slow down somewhat in the future.PepsiCo's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think PepsiCo will make a great income stock. We can't deny that the payments have been very stable, but we are a little bit worried about the very high payout ratio. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. To that end, PepsiCo has 5 warning signs (and 1 which is potentially serious) we think you should know about. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?
