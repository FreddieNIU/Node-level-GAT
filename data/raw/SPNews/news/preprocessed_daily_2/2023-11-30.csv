In particular, one-quarter of Americans have been found to underestimate how long a 60-year-old can live, posing a serious question mark on their preparedness for retirement. In this regard, CNBC reveals that 56% of Americans aren’t on track to save sufficiently for retirement because of the financial vortex they are caught up in, entangled in commitments like funding their children's education, managing mortgage payments, and similar financial pressures. Consequently, 40% of seniors are projected to run out of funds during retirement, as noted by TIME."", 'Fidelity Investments reports that individual retirement accounts and 401(k) balances bring unfavorable tidings as well, witnessing declines as of Q3, 2023. On the other hand, withdrawals and loans are gradually on the rise. Their data reveals that the average 401(k) balance has declined by 4% from $112,400 in Q2, 2023 to $107,700 in Q3, 2023. In the same quarter, 2.3% of workers were also reported to take hardship withdrawals, an increase from 1.8% in Q3,2022. Adding to the challenges, the benchmark for a comfortable retirement is continually escalating, with The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) now setting this target at $1.8 million.', 'To make matters worse, potential retirees are skeptical of waiting until the full retirement age to start claiming their social security benefits.

This leaves the potential retiree with a monthly average benefit of $1,800 only, a sum that isn't sufficient to last them each month during retirement. According to the survey, Americans believe that they would need an estimated $5,000 per month to have a comfortable retirement. For those who don't have enough saved, relocating to cheaper destinations is one solution. For instance, West Virginia is the state with the lowest cost of living for retirees. The MERIC index states that the cost of living index of the state is 85.2, which implies that living costs are 14.8% lower than the national average."", 'Many US employers are also actively enhancing their retirement plans in the quest to retain talent and boost employee retirement security and well-being. 401(k) plans are by far the most popular option that is used for saving retirement money. Employees use these plans to deposit pre-tax compensation for retirement, thereby maximizing their contributions. In many cases, employers may match contributions as well. Some companies that have a good matching percentage include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and Google, to name a few.', ""Employees at The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) have the benefit of receiving a $250 contribution from the company on contributing their first $1.

In the third quarter of 2023, overall DTC sales jumped 4% to $321.4 million. Within the DTC channel, brick-and-mortar sales have been outdoing e-commerce due to a competitive and promotional landscape.

While 2023 has been the year of outperformance by the Magnificent Seven, there are other market opportunities investors should keep an eye out for. Here with the details is Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre. Ines."", ""INES FERRE: Yeah, Josh. And if you weren't in the Magnificent Seven this year, you may have had sort of a muted performance in your portfolio. But I spoke to one portfolio manager who told me that he believes next year will be a year where you could see some broadening. So you could really pick some stocks within certain sectors."", 'And he basically was pointing to two trends next year. One is that the market has expected that the Fed is done with the interest rate hikes. And in fact, you could even see interest rates cuts, according to some market analysts out there. So you are seeing a leveling out of those interest rates.', ""And then for another trend that he sees is a destocking is over. So you had during 2021, 2022, companies hoarding inventory. And then they've had to destock this year. So he believes that trend is now over going into 2024. And so then you will have more of a normalization, so to speak, in some of these companies."", ""So one of the areas that he believes is good is real estate. And this is why. He says that real estate took the brunt of the interest rate hikes this year. And he believes that rental-- this is Aaron Dunn, who's co-head of value equity team at Eaton Vance, part of Morgan Stanley Investment Management. He has told me that mortgage rates have really impacted the real estate market this year, but rental homes will be in demand going into 2024 as building costs go up and the cost to finance some of these buildings go up."", ""So he's basically saying that you're going to see a demand for rental companies. And so invitation homes, INBH, that's one of the stocks that he's looking at, which is up 12% year-to-date. Also Mid-america communities is another stock, mAA and then basic materials is another sector that he's also taking a look at for opportunities."", 'When we talk about basic materials, these are companies that produce chemicals, everything from tin to timber. This is the stuff that goes into the products. And so he was saying that, look, you are-- the basic material companies are at the heart of the destocking trends. And so they have been destocking this year. And going into 2024, you are going to see some opportunities there. He was recommending FMH-- FMC, which is a company, a developer of insecticides for agriculture use. And so basic materials is where you may be seeing some stock picks.', ""Also, health care. XLV is down 4% this year. But he's saying, look, funding took a hit this year because of the high interest rate environment. And going into 2024, some of the companies that do more of the picks and shovels stocks, those are the ones that build out equipment for capacity for companies, for pharmaceutical companies. Thermo Fisher, which is down 10%, they provide everything from medical equipment to software and analytical tools, that's one company to take a look at within that sector."", 'And then the semiconductor, that has also been at the heart of the destocking trend that we have seen this year. So looking at semiconductors going into next year, especially the second half of next year if we get a little bit of a sluggishness at the first half of the year.

The firm helps retailers manage returns, which typically rise after pre-Christmas sales like Black Friday and Cyber Monday and continue beyond Christmas.', '""Our returns Super Bowl starts the day after Black Friday and goes into February,"" said Optoro CEO Amena Ali, comparing her sector\'s busy season to one of America\'s biggest sporting events.', 'The typical return costs retailers about $30. Returns drain profits because they must be transported, sorted and resold - often at a discount - or disposed of at a loss. That has helped prompt almost 90% of retailers to revise a range of policies this year, Ali said. Those changes also include offering store credit, charging for some returns and encouraging shoppers to bring online purchases back to physical stores.', '""You just can\'t afford to ignore it,"" she said of returns costs.', 'Reuters recently viewed a Walmart YouTube tutorial from February that helps marketplace sellers set parameters for their own return-less policies.', 'Walmart said it balances customer experience and its bottom line when considering exchanges and returns.

Wayfair customers in certain cases may have the option to keep items at a discount, according to the online furniture seller. Other retailers named by the shoppers did not respond to requests for comment.', 'THE RETURNS RUSH', 'The percentage of returns was nearly double pre-pandemic levels last year, standing at 16.5% of total U.S. retail sales - or $816.8 billion worth of goods, according to data from Appriss Retail and the National Retail Federation.', 'Sellers of underwear, bedding and food were among the first adopters of keep it returns due to hygiene concerns or health safety rules. Shapewear seller Shapermint uses the policy to build loyalty by asking shoppers to donate the items or gift them to friends, said Gabrielle Richards, brand director at Trafilea, which owns the company.', 'The practice went mainstream during the e-commerce boom of the early pandemic, when shipping and delivery costs soared and warehouses were bursting at the seams.

Moreover, with prevailing high interest rates and limited single-family home inventory, the cost of home ownership has risen relative to rents. This has made the transition from renter to homeowner difficult, making renting apartment units a more affordable and flexible option.The residential real estate investment trust (REIT) is making concerted efforts to diversify its portfolio and expand its footprint in the suburban markets, wherein these affluent renters prefer to live, work and play. EQR’s efforts to capture the renter demand in these markets are likely to pay off well in the upcoming period. For 2023, we estimate a year-over-year growth of 5% in the company’s total rental income.The company is leveraging technology and organizational capabilities to drive rent growth and improve the efficiency of its operating platform. It is focusing on equipping its properties with tech-driven features like smart home technology and building-wide Wi-Fi implementation to enhance customer experience.Such efforts are likely to also bring about operational resiliency by reducing costs. This gives Equity Residential a competitive edge over others and will aid in driving net operating income (NOI) growth in the upcoming period. Our estimate for current-year NOI indicates a year-over-year increase of 4.9%.Equity Residential is focusing on enhancing its portfolio quality by disposing of older properties and acquiring newer properties in submarkets with high numbers of affluent renters and favorable long-term demand drivers and manageable forward supply.During the nine months ended Sep 30, 2023, Equity Residential acquired four operating properties for an aggregate purchase price of $366.3 million and disposed of eight for an aggregate sale price of $195.4 million. Such efforts highlight its prudent capital management practices and preserve balance sheet strength.Equity Residential’s encouraging development pipeline amid healthy demand for rental apartment units bodes well. As of Sep 30, 2023, the company had seven projects (consolidated and unconsolidated) under development, comprising 2,207 apartment units.On the balance sheet front, the company had $2 billion of liquidity and a net debt to normalized EBITDAre of 4.24X as of Sep 30, 2023. Also, unencumbered net operating income (NOI) as a percentage of the total NOI was 89.8% in the third quarter, up from 88.5% reported in the prior quarter. An A-rated balance sheet renders the company access to the debt market at favorable rates.Hence, with manageable debt maturities, a large pool of high-quality unencumbered assets and solid credit metrics, EQR seems well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities.', 'The residential real estate market is witnessing an influx of new deliveries as the construction of several projects that had been put on hold during the pandemic is nearing an end. As a result of the elevated supply in some of the markets where the company operates, its ability to increase rent is likely to be affected. This phenomenon is expected to lead to rent growth moderation to a certain extent in the upcoming period. \xa0The continuation of the remote working environment has resulted in lower renter demand for costlier and urban/infill markets, raising concerns for EQR’s properties that are concentrated in the urban markets. This is likely to hurt occupancy levels at these properties. For 2023, management expects physical occupancy to stand at 95.9%, down 10 basis points from the prior guidance of 96%.Further, given the prevailing high interest rate environment, Equity Residential may find it difficult to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds as the costs are likely to be on the higher side.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 2.9% in the quarter-to-date period against the industry’s rise of 1.3%.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the residential REIT sector are Invitation Home INVH, American Homes 4 Rent AMH and Centerspace CSR, each currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

You can skip our detailed analysis of the implications of an aging population on the economy, the global longevity economy, and workplaces that embrace older employees, and go directly to 5 Countries with the Oldest Populations in the World.\xa0', 'For almost all of human history, the Earth’s population has skewed younger. But a major shift has occurred since 2018, and for the first time ever, there are more people on our planet over the age of 65 than there are children under the age of 5. This aging is the result of a continued decline in fertility rates and increased life expectancy. Consequently, compared to 2017, the number of persons aged 60 or above is expected to more than double by 2050 and more than triple by 2100, rising from 962 million globally in 2017, to 2.1 billion in 2050, and 3.1 billion by 2100.\xa0', 'Though a longer life span, particularly a healthy one, is viewed as an enormous gain for human welfare, it comes with its own set of challenges – shifting disease burden, increased expenditure on health and long-term care, labor-force shortages, dissaving, potential problems with old-age income security, and many more.\xa0', 'An aging population affects economies in many ways – the growth of GDP slows, there is a shortage of a skilled labor force, working-age people pay more to support the elderly, and public budgets strain under the burden of the higher total cost of health and retirement programs for old people.\xa0', 'However, new research suggests that an aging population could also, in fact, be good for economic growth, thanks in part to automation and technology. Economists from the prestigious MIT hypothesize that as populations age, businesses are more likely to adopt new technology that helps boost productivity. They argue that as the population ages, the number of working-age people declines relative to demand, which in turn causes an uptick in wages. These higher wages can then incentivize businesses to invest in technology and digitize most of their process, thus boosting productivity to such an extent that it even offsets the reduction in economic growth from the older population, or might even overwhelm it and cause an economic upswing.\xa0', 'Longevity economy is a concept that people living healthier, longer lives than previously have the potential to, in fact, be positive for the economy, thus offsetting the negative economic effects of an aging society. A key goal for the longevity economy is to raise employment over the life course, which in turn will require boosting human capital and productivity as older workers seek to maintain their skills for longer. An important component of boosting employment is the extension of working lives. Estimates for the U.K. suggest that a 1-year extension of working life also causes a GDP growth of 1%, and hence we’ve seen several countries around the world implement plans to raise the retirement age for their people.\xa0', 'By 2015, there were more than 1.6 billion people in the world who were part of the 50-plus cohort and this number is expected to double to nearly 3.2 billion by 2050. The global longevity economy consists of the vast economic impact of people aged 50 and over – within and across nations – driving the GDP growth, job creation, and income generation. According to AARP, people aged 50 and over contributed $45 trillion to global GDP in 2020, and by 2050, their contribution is expected to more than double to $118 trillion.', 'Although employers regularly tend to overlook the resumes of middle-aged and older applicants, some companies understand and appreciate the value, wisdom, and insight older workers can bring to the workforce – like being great mentors, or even mentees.\xa0', 'The American Association of Retired Persons Employer Pledge Program is a nationwide group of employers that stand with AARP in affirming the value of experienced workers and are committed to developing diverse organizations. MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) is a global entertainment company with national and international locations featuring best-in-class hotels and casinos, state-of-the-art meetings and conference spaces, incredible live and theatrical entertainment experiences, and an extensive array of restaurant, nightlife, and retail offerings. The Las-Vegas based company signed the AARP Employer Pledge in 2018, signaling to the communities in which it operates that it values and hires experienced workers. Michelle DiTondo, Chief Human Resources Officer for MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), said:\xa0', '“Hiring people of all ages, and from all walks of life and backgrounds, makes us a stronger team. We recognize the value of life experience within our workforce and appreciate the mentoring and guidance that can be provided by a more mature employee. We are proud to stand with the AARP and reinforce our commitment to recruit employees of all ages and backgrounds.”', 'MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) ranks among the Most Valuable Gambling Companies in the World.\xa0', 'Several employers have also started offering a novel benefit to their elder workforce – grandparent leave, or paid time off to employees upon the birth or adoption of a grandchild. Telecom giant Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) first introduced grandparent leave in 2017, after revamping its regular parental leave policy to be more gender inclusive, and offer more robust paid time off to caregivers. Over 30% of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)’s roughly 40,000-strong U.S. employee base is over age 50, and to help employees celebrate and support their loved ones during this special time, Cisco grandparents can take up to three paid days off within one year of the arrival of a new grandchild. More than 800 U.S. employees of the company have taken leave since the start of 2021, including over 200 who’ve used it so far this year.\xa0', 'Cisco Systems, Inc.

However, the Hungarian state currently only spends about 0.4% of GDP on care for the elderly, with a minimal year-on-year increase. The number of professional carers is also declining in the Central European country, as wages in the social sector are the lowest in the entire national economy.\xa0', 'Percentage of Population Aged 65+: 19.6%', 'Slovenia has an average life expectancy of 81 years, which is significantly higher than its neighboring countries of Croatia, Bosnia, and Hungary. Slovenia’s population of about 2 million is aging rapidly, mainly as a result of longer life expectancy and a decrease in birth rates among younger generations. In the period 2013-2060, the share of people aged 80+ in the Slovene population is expected to grow from 4.5% to 12.3%.\xa0', 'Percentage of Population Aged 65+: 19.6%', 'The average life expectancy in Denmark has been on an upward trajectory since the 1990s, mainly due to the general improvements in public health and advanced healthcare options in the country. In January 2021, a new sectorial organization was introduced by the government of Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, as the elderly area was moved to the Ministry of Social Affairs, now called The Danish Ministry of Social Affairs and Senior Citizens. The goal was to reinforce the link between the important welfare services in the municipalities.', 'Denmark is placed among the Countries with the Most Aged Population.\xa0', 'Percentage of Population Aged 65+: 19.6%', 'The Czech Republic is rapidly aging and it is expected that the 65+ segment of the population is set to grow to one-third of the entire Czech society in the second half of this century. Like many other European countries, the Czech Republic uses a Pay As You Go (PAYG) pension system, in which current employees contribute and the funds are automatically redistributed to pensioners. However, this system becomes precarious and loss-making if there are more pensioners than contributors, which could pose a serious problem for the Central European country in the future.\xa0', 'Percentage of Population Aged 65+: 19.8%', 'Estonia has a shrinking and aging population. The country’s total population, which amounted to 1.32 million in 2019, has been shrinking by 15% since its independence in 1991. Similarly, the total share of the population aged above 65 was 15% in 2003, now increased to 19.8%. As a result, Estonia’s elderly are constantly faced with problems such as an unnecessary division of resources within the system, a lack of geriatric medicine, a nursing health care system in its infancy, long waiting lists, and high cost of drugs.', 'Estonia sits among the Most Health-Conscious Countries in the World.\xa0', 'Percentage of Population Aged 65+: 19.8%', 'According to the European Commission, the working life in Lithuania should be increased to 72 years over the coming two decades. While it is not the same as retirement age, it would mean pursuing policies that would encourage people to work longer and retire later.\xa0', 'According to Bogulsavas Gruževskis, director of the Vilnius-based Centre of Social Research, there will be 50 retirees per 100 working people in Lithuania in the near future – a situation that will have crucial implications for public finances and may thus require raising taxes.', 'Lithuania is counted among the Countries with the Oldest People.\xa0', 'Percentage of Population Aged 65+: 19.9%', 'Because Sweden has one of the best social welfare and healthcare systems in the world, people live longer and therefore 20% of the population does not generate income or pay taxes from their salary. So the two possible solutions to prevent the economy from slowing down are increased immigration and a rise in births.\xa0', 'The Suedes’ longevity is also due in part to the Scandinavian country’s commitment to environmental cleanliness and the high-quality drinking water it provides to its citizens.\xa0', 'Percentage of Population Aged 65+: 20.2%', 'Due to its low birth rate and the high number of people leaving the country, Serbia ranks among the Countries with the Oldest Populations. A pressing issue for the Balkan country is the highly educated labor force leaving Serbia for better opportunities abroad – an annual exodus of approximately 51,000 people, with most of them being young.\xa0', 'Percentage of Population Aged 65+: 20.3%', ""Unlike many countries in Western Europe, Latvia is aging not because of large life expectancy gains, but because of an ever-shrinking younger generation. High emigration and low fertility is leading to an increase in the average age in society, and according to Eurostat data, more than 45% of Latvia's population is expected to be aged 50 or above by 2030.\xa0"", 'Latvia sits among the Top 10 Oldest Countries in the World.\xa0', 'Percentage of Population Aged 65+: 20.3%', ""A big reason why the French live so long is the country’s excellent healthcare system that covers everyone who is resident here, so there's no barrier to treatment if people need it. France has recently made headlines due to the massive protests by the people, which have often also turned violent, as a result of President Emmanuel Macron enacting controversial new reforms that have raised the retirement age from 62 to 64. This raise will make workers put more money into the system, which the government says is on course to run a deficit.\xa0"", 'Percentage of Population Aged 65+: 20.4%', 'Since Croatia joined the E.U. in mid-2013, there has been significant migration of young, skilled labor force from the Republic of Croatia to other countries in the Union. The Balkan country is also notorious for its infamously small pensions, and a person who earned relatively good money each month unfortunately still naturally expects a huge drop when retirement age comes knocking. According to the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute, in April 2019, 457,365 retirees received a pension of less than HRK 2,000, which amounts to about $281.\xa0', 'Croatia is ranked among the Oldest Countries in the World by Age of Population.\xa0', 'Percentage of Population Aged 65+: 21.3%', ""Bulgaria is heading for the steepest drop in the working-age population for any country, and this will impose a heavy burden on the national economy. The Southeastern European country's old-age dependency ratio – the share of elderly in the total population – is expected to double over the next four decades. However, Bulgaria could address this challenge by implementing policies related to healthy, active, and productive aging."", 'Percentage of Population Aged 65+: 21.4%', 'Germany is known for its high standard of living and, with that, one of the longest life spans globally. The number of people at retirement age (67 years or over) in the country will rise to at least 20 million until the middle of the 2030s, and as a result, Germany will spend 12.5% of its GDP on public pensions by 2050, against the average of 10% in the OECD.

If you want to skip our introduction to the mineral industry and some recent news, then take a look at the 5 Best Mineral Stocks To Buy Now. ', ""While money makes the world go around, the same can also be said of minerals. After all, the global economy is built on humanity's reliance on steel - which is made from a mineral. Then, silica, which is the backbone of the technology industry through its use in making semiconductors is also a mineral. As if this weren't enough, copper and lithium which are indispensable to humanity's fight to reduce global emissions, are also minerals."", 'This makes it clear that minerals go hand in hand with the economic prosperity of today and tomorrow. Naturally, the minerals and mining industry is also one of the biggest in the world when it comes to market value. For instance, data from The Business Research Company shows that the global mining market was worth $2.02 trillion in 2022 and it is slated to grow to sit at $2.1 trillion by the end of this year after growing through a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.1%. Then, the growth rate is expected to accelerate, as the research firm estimates that until 2027, the mining industry will have a 6.7% CAGR and a final value of $2.78 trillion.', ""Within the mineral industry, there are several different kinds of products that are produced. Minerals are generally defined as naturally occurring solid materials with defined atomic structures, which means that they cover nearly every metal known to humanity. This broad definition also means that the mineral industry is quite diverse with several different use cases, such as those we've mentioned above."", ""Delving deeper, while minerals are essential for the world's normal functioning today as well as future initiatives, capital expenditure within the mining sector varies with fluctuations within the commodities market. When prices are high, firms are encouraged to spend more to beef up their production, and when prices fall, they cut down on investments. Data from McKinsey shows that global capital expenditures in mining were cut in half from $260 billion in 2012 to $130 billion in 2020. This is concerning since progression with renewable and alternative energy sources is dependent on vibrant and robust investments in global mining capabilities. McKinsey adds that from 2016, the dollar value of mining capital expenditures started to grow but their percentage with respect to operational cash flows still remained low."", ""Shifting gears to narrow down our focus on mineral companies, one of the most important companies right now is Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB). Albemarle is crucial to the minerals industry since it is one of the biggest suppliers of lithium in the world. Lithium, if you're unaware, is crucial for the electric vehicle industry, and Albemarle is known for its crucial relationship with car companies including the electric vehicle giant Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, while everyone agrees that the long term prospects of lithium are quite strong due to its use in batteries, 2023 has been a rather surprising year for the industry. This is because lithium prices have considerably dropped this year, and as we mentioned above when prices drop, capital expenditures are also often reduced. You can also read 10 Most Profitable Lithium Stocks Now for more details about lithium stocks."", 'The scale of the 2023 lithium price crash is not widely reported either. As an example, consider the average price of battery grade lithium carbonate in China. This stood at $84,500 per metric ton in November 2022, but a year later, has dropped by a rather stunning 78% to sit at $18,630 as of late November 2023. At the heart of this drop is the current global investment and economic climate, as high interest rates have also put the brakes on global electric vehicle demand and high inflation coupled with labor market uncertainty has limited the amount of money that people can fork out themselves for pricey car purchases.', 'At the same time, mining and minerals firms are also speeding up their investments in environmentally friendly technologies to reduce the impact of their operations on their surroundings. For instance, one of the biggest mining companies in the world, the British giant Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), is currently investigating the use of a bio-friendly material to replace the reliance on dirty coking coal for producing a titanium ore used to make plastics, inks, and fabrics.', ""Today, we'll take a look at some top mineral stocks to buy with the notable picks being Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

Meanwhile, the industry has dipped 5.2%, whereas the S&P 500 has risen 12% in the same timeframe.', 'In the first quarter of 2022, Sealed Air first witnessed a drop in volumes that continued to intensify over the remaining three quarters of the year. Overall, the company reported a 6% year-over-year decline in volume in 2022. This trend has continued in 2023 as well, with the company reporting 9.3%, 8.2% and 5.9% declines in the first, second and third quarters of 2023, respectively.', '\xa0', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', '\xa0', 'The volume decline was more pronounced in the Protective segment where it was down 11% in 2022 and 18% in the first quarter of 2023, 19% in the second quarter and 13% in the third quarter. This reflects the recessionary pressures in the industrial and fulfillment markets. In the Food segment, volumes decreased 2% in 2022 followed by 2.6% in the first quarter of 2023, 0.2% in the second quarter and 0.8% in the third quarter. This was driven by food retail market declines and the impact of supply disruptions.', 'In 2022, Sealed Air experienced supply disruptions such as the limited availability of certain raw materials and equipment components. During the course of this year, many of these shortages related to raw materials have lessened. However, the company has still noted supply shortages for certain equipment components and long lead times to procure these equipment components.', 'Also, SEE’s total debt to total capital ratio remained high at 0.92 as of Sep 30, 2023. The figure is much higher than the industry’s 0.67.', 'Due to the abovementioned headwinds, Sealed Air projects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.95 for 2023. Compared with adjusted earnings per share of $4.10 in 2022, the guidance indicates a 30.5% plunge.', ""Volumes are expected to pick up eventually as the situation normalizes and customers' inventory resumes normal levels. Growing demand for automated and sustainable packaging solutions that maximize food safety, protect goods, reduce waste and deliver savings to customers through productivity will drive Sealed Air’s food and protected packaging segments. The strategic acquisition of Liquibox is expected to boost results. The acquisition is highly complementary to the Cryovac Fluids & Liquids business and will further the company’s vision to become a leader in fluids and liquid packaging.Around 63% of Sealed Air’s revenues come from the packaging of protein, foods, fluids and goods for the medical and life sciences industries. The food segment will benefit from the shift in demand for case-ready, shrink bags and pre-packaged meals and snacks designed for home consumption. In the medical and life sciences portfolio, demand for protected packaging solutions for medical supplies, pharmaceuticals and personal protective equipment remains high. It is also benefiting from growth in online shipments of medical equipment and pharmaceuticals."", 'Sealed Air continues to capitalize on the global e-commerce growth and increased demand for recyclable materials, fiber-based solutions and automated packaging. Thus, with around 74% of its revenues originating from essential end-markets, the company will deliver solid top-line performance.', 'The company’s Reinvent SEE Strategy program, which was implemented in 2018, was focused on innovations, SG&A productivity, product-cost efficiency, channel optimization and customer-service enhancements. This year, the company has embarked on the Reinvent SEE 2.0 initiative, which will advance the next phase of its transformation as it continues to build on the success of Reinvent SEE.', 'Per the new program, the company will focus on expanding the Fluids & Liquids Vertical segment by leveraging Cryovac and Liquibox. It will aim to enhance its competitive capabilities by combining highly complementary solutions within the fluids & liquids business while generating strong synergies and accelerating innovation. The company will expand and grow its portfolio of automation solutions and also advance prismiq digital packaging and printing solutions.

This move has caught the attention of investors and market analysts, as insider transactions can often provide valuable insights into a company's prospects and the sentiment of its top executives."", ""Patrice Louvet has been at the helm of Ralph Lauren Corp as the President and CEO since July 2017. With a wealth of experience in the consumer goods industry, Louvet has been instrumental in steering the iconic fashion brand through a rapidly evolving retail landscape. Prior to joining Ralph Lauren, Louvet held several high-profile positions at Procter & Gamble, overseeing global beauty brands. His leadership at Ralph Lauren has been marked by a focus on expanding the brand's digital presence and enhancing its global appeal."", ""Ralph Lauren Corp is a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including apparel, accessories, home furnishings, and other licensed product categories. Founded in 1967 by American designer Ralph Lauren, the company has built a vast empire that represents a distinctive American perspective on style, underpinned by a wide array of products that cater to a diverse customer base. Ralph Lauren's commitment to quality and craftsmanship has solidified its position as a key player in the luxury fashion sector."", ""The insider transaction history for Ralph Lauren Corp reveals a pattern of more insider selling than buying over the past year. Specifically, Patrice Louvet has sold a total of 142,026 shares and has not made any purchases. This could be interpreted in several ways. On one hand, insiders might sell shares for personal financial reasons that do not necessarily reflect their outlook on the company's future. On the other hand, consistent selling by insiders, particularly by high-ranking executives like the CEO, might raise questions about their confidence in the company's valuation or growth prospects."", ""When examining the relationship between insider selling and the stock price, it's important to consider the context of each transaction. The recent sale by the insider occurred with Ralph Lauren Corp shares trading at $124.93, giving the company a market cap of $8.367 billion. This price point is situated below the industry median price-earnings ratio of 18.76 and also below the company's historical median price-earnings ratio, indicating that the stock may be undervalued based on earnings."", ""The valuation of Ralph Lauren Corp, with a price-earnings ratio of 16.53, suggests that the stock is trading at a discount relative to its peers. This could be an attractive entry point for value investors who believe in the company's fundamentals and long-term growth potential.With a price of $124.93 and a GuruFocus Value (GF Value) of $130.26, Ralph Lauren Corp is considered to be Fairly Valued. The price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.96 reinforces this assessment, indicating that the stock is trading close to its intrinsic value as estimated by GuruFocus."", ""The GF Value is a proprietary metric that takes into account historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates from analysts. Given that the stock is trading near its GF Value, investors might view the insider's decision to sell as a signal to take profits or reallocate their portfolio rather than a lack of faith in the company's future."", ""The recent insider sell by Patrice Louvet, President and CEO of Ralph Lauren Corp, represents a significant transaction that warrants attention. While the insider's selling activity over the past year has been notable, it is essential to consider the broader context of the company's valuation and market performance. With Ralph Lauren Corp's stock being fairly valued and trading at a lower price-earnings ratio than the industry median, investors should weigh the insider's actions against their own research and investment strategy. As always, insider transactions are just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to making informed investment decisions."", 'Warning!

Firstly, the Marcellus Shale, spanning Pennsylvania and West Virginia and extending into New York, Ohio, and Maryland is a significant part of the Appalachian Basin and one of the largest natural gas fields in the US.\xa0Another important area is the Permian Basin, which stretches across Texas and New Mexico. Although primarily known for its oil production, this basin has experienced a surge in natural gas production due to new drilling techniques.\xa0', ""In the south-central United States, the Haynesville Shale, located in Louisiana and East Texas, has witnessed a resurgence in production. The Piceance Basin in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, known for its substantial gas in tight sand formations, and the Anadarko Basin, spreading across Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, and Colorado, are also notable for their gas reserves. Moreover, the Utica Shale, primarily beneath Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, offers impressive future potential.

Although comparatively underdeveloped, its vast, untapped reserves could play an essential role in shaping the country's energy landscape."", 'Due to its rich regions, the US now produces the majority of the natural gas it consumes.

These new methods have made it easier to extract gas from these challenging areas.', ""It's noteworthy that in 2022, the production of dry natural gas in the US exceeded its total consumption by about 13%.

If you want to skip our overview of seasonal investing and some recent stock market news, then take a look at 5 Best Seasonal Stocks To Buy Now. ', 'Seasonality and cyclicality are unavoidable parts of the climate, the economy, and business operations. Just like summers and winters regularly take place each year, an economy undergoes periods of economic growth and economic contraction. Similarly, businesses are often limited to selling their products in certain months, and this ends up affecting their supply chain as well.', ""One of the strongest examples of seasonal revenue is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple's fiscal year ends in September, and the month is also central to the firm's business cycle. Apple regularly upgrades its iPhone in September, and October marks the start of its first quarter. Naturally, sales of the iPhone are highest when the smartphone is launched, and Apple's revenue is the highest during Q1 as well. This cyclical nature also translates downstream into Apple's supply chain in the form of orders made to build the iPhone."", ""Before Apple's first fiscal quarter, orders made to companies such as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) pick up during the quarter ending in September and they slow down during a year's first calendar quarter after the U.S. technology giant has finished making most of the orders for its latest products. Looking at the firm's latest revenue figures. its first quarter of fiscal year 2023 revenue stood at $117 billion and went on to drop to $94 billion, $81 billion, and $89 billion during the succeeding quarters, respectively."", ""The next question to ask after keeping this seasonality in mind is if it affects stock performance. After all, if some quarters consistently see higher revenues, then one might also imagine that the stock price gains more during these time periods. Well, data compiled by the analytics platform Tradewell shows that October is the best month to buy Apple's shares as they historically return 5.35% on average. For a three month period, the months between November and February see the stock post the most returns, sitting at 8.67%. Likewise, the three months between May and August are the worst months for the shares. Comparing these figures with the nature of Apple's business shows that the business cycle does appear to create short term opportunities for stock market profit taking."", ""Similar perturbations are also present in the economy as we alluded to above. These come in the form of cyclicality, a data pattern that is similar to seasonality. The difference between seasonality and cyclicality is that seasonal patterns follow a set time period (like the summer months or Apple's quarterly revenue) while cyclical patterns are not time constrained. What this means is that an economy can show peak growth and peak drops over any time period, whether it's one month or one year - with the only certainty being that these extreme highs and lows will take place."", 'Coming back to the stock market, seasonality is one of the most favorite topics in academia, with researchers consistently studying any factor that could influence share price returns. One such research paper comes from the Ivey Business School of the University of Western Ontario. It analyzed value and growth stock performance of equities listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX (now NYSE American) stock exchanges to discover that not only is seasonality present across returns generated by both value and growth stocks, but also that they exhibit different seasonal patterns.', 'The researchers concluded:', 'The paper finds that both value and growth stocks exhibit seasonal strength in January and the first half of the year, but the effect is stronger for the value stocks. In the second half of the year, however, the opposite is true. Growth stocks exhibit weaker performance than value stocks. Seasonality is also observed in the value premium, which exhibits peak seasonal strength in the June to July period for NASDAQ and NYSE and relative seasonal weakness in the remaining months of the year. AMEX stocks, on the other hand, exhibit seasonal strength in the first seven months of the year and seasonal weakness thereafter, with AMEX value premium turning negative, which is unlike the NYSE and NASDAQ value premiums that always remain positive. While the findings are, in general, consistent with the January seasonal strength of value stocks found by Loughran (1997), there is no evidence that NASDAQ stocks drive the results. The findings, which are pervasive across all markets examined, are consistent with the gamesmanship hypothesis and portfolio rebalancing by professional portfolio managers. However, they are not consistent with the argument that it may be higher risk that drives the outperformance of value stocks. This is because while portfolio managers seem to rebalance aggressively into value stocks at the beginning of the year, they switch out of growth stocks more aggressively in the second half of the year (which they would not do if growth stocks had lower risk than value stocks), thus negating the argument that value stocks bear more risk that growth stocks.', ""Today, we'll look at some seasonal stocks and the top picks are Amazon.com, Inc.

The real estate sector has faced challenges, including disinflation and growing counterparty risk, which have hindered REIT performance.', 'However, Oppenheimer analyst Tyler Batory, an expert in the REIT sector, sees a clear opportunity within REITs that concentrate on the hotel and leisure segment. He points out ‘bright spots’ that could potentially drive these stocks upward, making them appealing additions to investors’ portfolios for the upcoming year.', '“We expect the group to outperform other segments in 2024,” Batory says of the Hotel REIT group, and goes on, “Commentary from REIT management teams indicates booking pace next year should be up double digits YoY on average. The large number of employees working remotely is also a thematic tailwind for group meetings. This trend should help urban markets outperform other locations in 2024. The recovery in corporate travel and favorable comps are contributing factors as well.”', 'These factors can provide some solid backing, so let’s look into some of Batory’s picks. These are two hotel REITs that could make investors happy for the holiday season. Here are their details, from the TipRanks database, presented with Batory’s comments.', 'There’s an Opportunity Brewing in These 3 Stocks, Says Goldman Sachs', 'Buy These 2 Beaten-Down Stocks Before They Rebound, Says UBS', 'Morgan Stanley Says These 3 Stocks Are Top Picks for 2024', 'RLJ Lodging Trust (RLJ)', 'The first hotel REIT we’ll look at is RLJ Lodging Trust, which operates as a hotel investment company and has focused its portfolio on premium-branded, rooms-oriented, high-margin, focused-service, and compact full-service hotels. Overall, RLJ has 97 hotels in its portfolio spread across 23 states plus DC, boasting a total of 21,400 rooms. The company’s assets are concentrated in markets that feature high long-term growth prospects.', 'Geographically, RLJ’s holdings are located in diverse cities, including Chicago, Pittsburgh, Charleston, Atlanta, New Orleans, and Seattle. The company chooses properties with the ability to generate a high RevPAR (revenue per available room, an important industry metric) and strong margins—both keys to attractive returns in the hotel business.', 'In addition, a quirk of RLJ’s target markets makes the company much more interesting to investors seeking exposure to the hotel industry. RLJ invests in markets that feature a combination of high density, high real estate values, and high construction costs – all of which create barriers to entry for individual investors. RLJ has the size and scale to enter these markets, thereby making them accessible to its own investors.', 'When we look at revenue and earnings, we find that this company brings in the highest values for both in Q2 and Q3 of the year. We have just come off the 3Q23 earnings season, and we can see that RLJ reported some solid metrics. The company’s RevPAR came to $148.81, up 3.4% year-over-year, while the total revenue of $334.4 million was up 5% from the previous year and beat the forecast by $7.75 million. On the bottom line, RLJ’s funds from operations per share, or FFO per share (another key metric when dealing with REITs), was reported as $0.40. This beat the forecast by a penny and easily covered the company’s declared dividend.', 'The dividend is important, as REITs have long been known as ‘dividend champs.’ In this case, the company last declared a 10-cent per common share dividend and paid it out on Oct 16. The dividend’s annualized rate of 40 cents gives a forward yield of nearly 3.8%, more than enough to beat the current annualized rate of inflation.', 'For Oppenheimer’s Tyler Batory, the key here is RLJ’s overall strong position. Simply put, the analyst sees this company as perfectly placed to reap gains later on, and to makes those gains available to investors.', '“RLJ is the best way to play strong urban market trends, in our view. The portfolio should also benefit from several conversions, improving business travel, and elevated levels of group demand. We believe revenue growth positions the company for better hotel EBITDA performance than peers. The company also has a well-positioned balance sheet and substantial liquidity… Our expectation is these themes will show up on 1H24 results that exceed sector averages. We think they also position RLJ with a larger growth trajectory than peers from 2022 to 2025,” Batory opined.', 'Batory goes on to give the shares an upgrade from Neutral to Outperform (i.e. Buy), and he sets a price target of $13 to point toward a 22% gain in the coming months. (To watch Batory’s track record, click here)', 'Most of the Batory’s colleagues are on the same page. Based on 4 Buys and 1 Hold, RLJ has a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are trading for $10.63 and their $14 average price target points toward a one-year upside near 32% . (See RLJ stock forecast)', 'Host Hotels & Resorts (HST)', 'The second Oppenheimer REIT-pick on our list is Host Hotels & Resorts, a hotel REIT with an international footprint. The company has built its portfolio on high-end hotels, frequently located on or near prime beachfront zones but always set in attractive tourist destinations. The company has 77 hotel properties, located in 20 of the top US markets, as well as in selected cities in Canada and Brazil. Host’s properties boast, in all, approximately 42,000 rooms.', 'With its extensive portfolio, more than $12 billion in total assets, and its $12.6 billion market cap, Host Hotels can make a strong claim to being the largest lodging REIT in the global markets. The firm has a stated aim of being the best in its class and generating long-term shareholder value. Host’s day-to-day work involves the acquisition, renovation, and development of upscale and luxury hotel properties.', 'Generating shareholder value has an immediate impact on investors, and can be clearly seen in Host’s policies on share buybacks and dividend payments. The company spent $100 million in 3Q23 repurchasing 6.5 million shares, part of the company’s $150 million worth of year-to-date buybacks. Host has $823 million remaining in its buyback authorization.', 'On the dividend, Host in September declared its Q3 common share payment for 18 cents per share. This was an increase from the 15-cent dividend paid in Q2. Host has a history of adjusting the dividend quarter-by-quarter to match income levels and market conditions. Extrapolating forward, the current dividend – which was paid on October 16 – gives a yield of 4.1%.', 'Getting to the company’s revenues and earnings, we find that Host reported $1.2 billion at the top line in Q3, up a modest 1.7% y/y and besting the forecast by $10 million. The bottom line, reported as an adjusted FFO (funds from operations) of 41 cents, easily covered the dividend in full. The FFO was up from 38 cents in 2Q23 and beat the estimates by 6 cents.', 'Once again, we’ll check in with Tyler Batory, who sees Host Hotels as a strong player in its niche, with solid prospects for further growth as the economy continues to normalize. Batory writes, “We think HST is well positioned in 2024 to take advantage of recovery business transient and the positive outlook for group demand. Roughly 33% of 2022 room revenues was business transient, while 32% was group. Business transient was down 17% to 2019 in September, representing runway for continued recovery. The recovery in Maui and its hurricane-disrupted properties should be tailwinds as well.”', 'Looking ahead, the Oppenheimer analyst gives this stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating. His price target here, now at $21, implies the shares will advance another 20% by this time next year.', 'Overall, HST shares claim a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 11 recent reviews. These reviews include 7 to Buy, 3 to Hold, and 1 to Sell. The share are currently selling for $17.44, and the average target price of $20.36 suggests an upside of ~17% or more on the one-year horizon.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the tobacco market in America, the effect of taxes on smoking, and the rise of smokeless tobacco, and go directly to 5 States With the Most Expensive Cigarettes in the US.\xa0', ""Tobacco was first used by the people of pre-Columbian Americas. Archeological studies suggest that the Maya people of Central America started using tobacco leaves as far back as the 1st century BC, mainly for smoking in sacred and religious ceremonies. By the time Columbus arrived in the New World in 1492, the Native Americans were already cultivating and smoking tobacco in pipes, cigars, and snuff. Although Cristopher Columbus brought with him a few tobacco leaves and seeds back to Europe, most Europeans didn't get their first taste of the plant until the mid-16th century, when adventurers and diplomats like France's Jean Nicot – for whom nicotine is named – began to popularize its use. Tobacco was introduced to France in 1556, Portugal in 1558, Spain in 1559, and finally England in 1565. By the early 17th century, smoking was common in all of Europe’s maritime nations, and their colonial empires soon carried tobacco all over the world."", 'According to 2021 figures from the CDC, an estimated 11.5% (28.3 million) of American adults smoked cigarettes. The same year, Grand View Research valued the U.S. tobacco market size at $75.9 billion, expecting it to grow at a CAGR of 3.4% from 2022 to 2030. Due to higher taxation and increasing health awareness, the smoking rate among American adults has dropped significantly over the last few decades. So to keep up with the changing consumer preferences, several manufacturers are marketing many novel offerings like cigars, cigarillos, and next-generation products to expand their profit margin.\xa0', 'The total U.S. annual tobacco consumption was recorded at 237,079 tons in 2020, putting it among the Countries with the Highest Tobacco Consumption.\xa0', 'Most studies have found that increasing cigarette prices through increased taxation is a highly effective measure to reduce smoking among youth and young adults. From 2001 through 2015, increases in state-level excise taxes were associated with significant declines in prevalence of cigarette smoking, with the strongest effect among young adults aged 18 to 24.\xa0', 'However, this strategy hasn’t been very effective for reducing the smoking prevalence among participants with annual income below $25,000, probably due to their limited exposure to cessation treatment and anti-smoking programs. Poor working conditions are also linked to high smoking prevalence. And as both low- and high-income smokers pay the same amount of cigarette tax per pack, the former spend a disproportionately large share of their income on smoking. Thus, since low-income individuals are price-insensitive, raising cigarette taxes and prices would further deepen income disparities.\xa0', 'Traditional oral tobacco products are widely used in the U.S., consumed by an estimated 5.7 million adults in the country. However, contemporary oral tobacco products, like nicotine pouches, are becoming increasingly popular and fall under a brand new category that presents a safer alternative to more conventional oral consumables, such as snuff and snus. As a result, several key industry players are also making inroads into this category.\xa0', 'It was announced earlier this year that Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) has completed its 100% takeover of the Stockholm-based nicotine pouch maker Swedish Match, in a deal that cost the tobacco giant around $16 billion. Swedish Match has made huge strides in its relentless pursuit of tobacco harm reduction through its range of smoke-free products, and its leading nicotine pouch product, ZYN, will bolster the Marlboro-maker’s growing smoke-free portfolio of heated tobacco products, e-vapor devices, and oral nicotine products. By 2025, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) aims to be a predominantly smoke-free company, with more than half of its total net revenues coming from its growing portfolio of smoke-free alternatives.\xa0', 'Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is counted among the Best Tobacco and Cigarette Stocks to Buy.\xa0', 'Similarly, the Richmond-based Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) also entered the oral nicotine pouch market in 2019, when it acquired an 80% stake in the Swiss tobacco company Burger Söhne Holding AG for $372 million, and agreed to start distributing its On! brand in the U.S. Following the acquisition, the number of stores selling On! had already nearly doubled by the end of the following year, as the product was ‘attracting female tobacco consumers due to its spitless, white, and compact format’. As a result, Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) also acquired the remaining 20% of the On! global business it did not own for approximately $250 million in 2021.', 'Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) ranks among the High Dividend Stocks Picked by Billionaire Ray Dalio.\xa0', 'With that said, here are the States that have the Most Expensive Cigarettes in America.', 'Pixabay/Public Domain', 'To collect data for this article, we have referred to Wisevoter, looking for States with the Highest Cigarette Prices.

Arizona banned smoking indoors in public spaces at the state level, but there is no statewide policy for vaping.\xa0', 'Average Retail Price per Pack: $7.93', 'Cigarette sales in Wisconsin plummeted over the last twenty years, fueled by higher taxes and smoking bans. Just under 193 million packs of cigarettes were sold in the Badger State last year, against 420 million in 2001. During that time span, a statewide smoking ban took effect, cigarette taxes were increased three times, and there was a growth in substitute products like e-cigarettes.', 'The cigarette tax, totaling $509.79 million, provided 75.2% of general fund excise tax collections in Wisconsin in 2021.\xa0', 'Average Retail Price per Pack: $8.06', 'There hasn’t been a substantial increase in New Jersey’s tobacco tax rate since 2009 and the state currently collects $2.7 in cigarette tax per pack.

However, the money for the so-called First 5 California programs has plummeted significantly over the years, as from 1989 to 2019, the adult smoking rate in California dropped tremendously from 22% to 10%. One proposed alternative to offset this downward spiral is for the state and local governments to increase the taxes on alcohol instead.\xa0', 'Average Retail Price per Pack: $8.24', 'The PA House of Representatives passed House Bill 1300 recently, which would increase the cigarette price markup in the Keystone State.

Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley argues that while Apple leads in technological innovation, it lacks credentials in highly regulated financial services, suggesting Apple\'s move into finances is a ""lock-in"" method to keep users loyal to the Apple brand.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""- Well, Apple and Goldman Sachs are parting ways. That's according to several reports. Now the tech giant sent the big bank a proposal to end its partnership on its credit card and savings accounts in the next 12 to 15 months. So what does this mean for cardholders? And who better to ask than Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. And Dan, we were having this discussion earlier this morning. I think there's a lot of cardholders out there that are asking, what exactly does this mean for me personally? Can you shed some light?"", ""DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. I mean, I have an Apple Card myself. It's not bad. So what's going on, man? What's going on, Apple? I need to figure this out. But chances are they're going to keep this going. Let's put things in perspective real quick. The Apple Card, the Apple Savings Account that they just recently launched with Goldman, it's not going to be a huge part of their services revenue, right? You're going to get most of their services revenue from something like Apple Care, like Music Plus, like Apple TV Plus, Fitness Plus, things like that. This isn't necessarily going to be a huge part."", ""What it is is a lock-in, right? If your credit card is attached to your smartphone, why the hell are you going to go pick up a Google phone? It's on your iPhone. So that's part of the idea there. Ditto if you have a savings account with Apple. Then you're definitely not leaving. So it's all part of the lock-in."", ""Now there's been speculation in some of these reports that they would go with different banks. That's probably what's going to happen. Apple's been kind of putting its toes into the financial market for a little bit with this card in 2019, with the savings account, with the buy now, pay later plans that they have."", ""They don't run the actual banking part though. That's where Goldman comes in. So it's an Apple brand. It's Goldman on the back end. When you get the card itself, sure it says Goldman on the back. But when you pick it up, it looks like an Apple product. So you know I think they're going to continue with this. It's just going to be a matter of I guess reissuing cards to people if it's going to be a new financial institution. And then continuing to see if that institution will move forward with Apple indefinitely."", ""I think if they pulled out, it would be kind of egg on their face entirely. I don't think they're going to do that. This is a chance for them, as I said, to really push forward the lock-in for users. Look, you buy a pair of AirPods, you buy an Apple Watch, yeah, you're probably going to stick around. But it's not a do or die after a few years if you want to go to an Android phone or something like that. You can. Again, if you're banking is connected to your phone, you're not ditching that company. You're sticking with them for the long term. You're going to continue to buy their products and their services, and that's really what this is about."", '- You think about sentiment around Apple as a technology company. Will that same sentiment prevail if they were seen as one of the major tech companies that was influencing financial services?', ""DAN HOWLEY: That's a good question, right? I mean, you look at Apple as this huge innovator in the tech space. People have generally good feelings about Apple because they love the phones. They love the iPads. They love the products."", ""- It's a sticky ecosystem."", ""DAN HOWLEY: Right. When you get into the financial side of things though, people aren't really going to feel as warm and fuzzy about Apple if they really started going headlong into this. So I think the idea that they're separate from the actual banking infrastructure gives them kind of leeway, right?"", ""The card also, by the way, I mean, the way they set it up is awesome. The colors there basically indicate what you're spending on and how much you're spending. You can pay early. There's issues with how they give statements, which is different than other credit cards. So that's something that Goldman was trying to deal with, cause problems with customer service. And so now that they're seemingly backing out according to these reports, it would behoove Apple to ensure that they keep everything the same outside of the actual back end banking stuff.""]"

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Accordingly, Schlumberger investors that purchase the stock on or after the 5th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 11th of January."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.25 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.00 to shareholders.

So we need to investigate whether Schlumberger can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger ', 'Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Schlumberger paid out a comfortable 32% of its profit last year.

Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 46% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.', ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see Schlumberger has grown its earnings rapidly, up 38% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Schlumberger has seen its dividend decline 2.2% per annum on average over the past 10 years, which is not great to see. It's unusual to see earnings per share increasing at the same time as dividends per share have been in decline. We'd hope it's because the company is reinvesting heavily in its business, but it could also suggest business is lumpy."", ""Is Schlumberger an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Schlumberger has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers."", 'Leggett & Platt reported tepid third-quarter 2023 results, with earnings and sales missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The top and the bottom line declined on a year-over-year basis. The downtrend was caused by persistent weak demand in the Bedding Products and Furniture and Flooring & Textile Products segments, partially offset by strong demand in the Specialized Products segment.The company lowered its 2023 guidance due to ongoing macroeconomic volatility, weak consumer demand in residential markets and the modest impact of the UAW strike on North American automakers.', 'Leggett reported adjusted earnings of 36 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of adjusted earnings of 39 cents per share by 7.7%. Also, the bottom line decreased 30.8% from 52 cents per share reported a year ago.Trade sales of $1.18 billion missed the consensus mark of $1.24 billion by 5.5%. The metric also declined 9% from the prior-year quarter’s levels of $1.29 billion.Organically, sales were down 11% year over year. Raw-material-related selling prices decline (net of currency benefit) ailed the results by 5%. Volume was down 6% due to continued demand softness in residential end markets, partially offset by growth in the Automotive and Aerospace businesses. That said, acquisitions contributed 2% to sales growth.Adjusted EBIT declined 24% from the prior-year quarter’s levels to $86 million. The downside was due to lower volume in residential end markets and lower metal margins in the Steel Rod business. This was partially offset by a $5.4 million gain from a real estate sale within the company’s Bedding segment.Adjusted EBIT margin contracted 140 basis points (bps) to 7.3% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Adjusted EBITDA margin also declined 110 bps to 11.1%.', 'Bedding Products: Net trade sales (excluding intersegment sales) decreased 17% (all organic) from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $483.3 million. This segment’s sales missed our model’s prediction of $504.5 million. An 8% decline in volume, primarily caused by softness in domestic markets.

Adjusted EBITDA margin also contracted 130 bps year over year to 10.7%.Specialized Products: Trade sales rose 10% as reported and 3% organically from the prior-year quarter to $319.4 million. This segment’s sales missed our model’s prediction of $322.4 million.Volume increased by 3% across the segment, primarily driven by growth in Aerospace and Automotive businesses. The decrease in raw material-related selling price was offset by currency benefits. Hydraulic Cylinders acquisition contributed 7%.EBIT margin contracted by 90 bps to 9.8%.

The trailing 12-month net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 3.15x at the third-quarter end, compared with 2.63x in the year-ago period and 2.66x at the 2022 end.Cash from operations for the reported quarter totaled $143.8 million, compared with $65.5 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $22 million in the third quarter, compared with $25 million in the previous year.', 'Leggett now expects sales in the range of $4.7–$4.75 billion (previously expected $4.75-$4.95 billion), indicating a decline of 8% to 9% year over year owing to low expected volume in residential end markets. Volumes are expected to decline by mid-single digits at the midpoint. Raw-material-related price decrease and currency impact are likely to reduce sales by mid-single digits, while acquisitions are expected to aid the same by about 2%.Sales are likely to be down high-single digits in the Bedding Products and down low double-digit in Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products segments. Nonetheless, the same is expected to be up high single-digits in Specialized Products.Earnings are projected to be between $1.35 per share and $1.45 per share (previously expected in the range of $1.45-$1.65 per share). This excludes about 7 cents per share gain from net insurance proceeds from tornado damage and 3 cents per share gain from the sale of real estate. LEG expects adjusted EBIT margin to be in the range of 7-7.3% compared with the previous range of 7.3-7.7%.Capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization costs and operating cash flow are estimated to be $110-$130 million, approximately $185 million and $450-$500 million, respectively. Dividend and net interest expenses are likely to be nearly $240 million and $85 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year is anticipated to be 24%.

If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in."", 'Outlook', ""Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

If you want to skip our introduction to the mineral industry and some recent news, then take a look at the 5 Best Mineral Stocks To Buy Now. ', ""While money makes the world go around, the same can also be said of minerals. After all, the global economy is built on humanity's reliance on steel - which is made from a mineral. Then, silica, which is the backbone of the technology industry through its use in making semiconductors is also a mineral. As if this weren't enough, copper and lithium which are indispensable to humanity's fight to reduce global emissions, are also minerals."", 'This makes it clear that minerals go hand in hand with the economic prosperity of today and tomorrow. Naturally, the minerals and mining industry is also one of the biggest in the world when it comes to market value. For instance, data from The Business Research Company shows that the global mining market was worth $2.02 trillion in 2022 and it is slated to grow to sit at $2.1 trillion by the end of this year after growing through a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.1%. Then, the growth rate is expected to accelerate, as the research firm estimates that until 2027, the mining industry will have a 6.7% CAGR and a final value of $2.78 trillion.', ""Within the mineral industry, there are several different kinds of products that are produced. Minerals are generally defined as naturally occurring solid materials with defined atomic structures, which means that they cover nearly every metal known to humanity. This broad definition also means that the mineral industry is quite diverse with several different use cases, such as those we've mentioned above."", ""Delving deeper, while minerals are essential for the world's normal functioning today as well as future initiatives, capital expenditure within the mining sector varies with fluctuations within the commodities market. When prices are high, firms are encouraged to spend more to beef up their production, and when prices fall, they cut down on investments. Data from McKinsey shows that global capital expenditures in mining were cut in half from $260 billion in 2012 to $130 billion in 2020. This is concerning since progression with renewable and alternative energy sources is dependent on vibrant and robust investments in global mining capabilities. McKinsey adds that from 2016, the dollar value of mining capital expenditures started to grow but their percentage with respect to operational cash flows still remained low."", ""Shifting gears to narrow down our focus on mineral companies, one of the most important companies right now is Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB). Albemarle is crucial to the minerals industry since it is one of the biggest suppliers of lithium in the world. Lithium, if you're unaware, is crucial for the electric vehicle industry, and Albemarle is known for its crucial relationship with car companies including the electric vehicle giant Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, while everyone agrees that the long term prospects of lithium are quite strong due to its use in batteries, 2023 has been a rather surprising year for the industry. This is because lithium prices have considerably dropped this year, and as we mentioned above when prices drop, capital expenditures are also often reduced. You can also read 10 Most Profitable Lithium Stocks Now for more details about lithium stocks."", 'The scale of the 2023 lithium price crash is not widely reported either. As an example, consider the average price of battery grade lithium carbonate in China. This stood at $84,500 per metric ton in November 2022, but a year later, has dropped by a rather stunning 78% to sit at $18,630 as of late November 2023. At the heart of this drop is the current global investment and economic climate, as high interest rates have also put the brakes on global electric vehicle demand and high inflation coupled with labor market uncertainty has limited the amount of money that people can fork out themselves for pricey car purchases.', 'At the same time, mining and minerals firms are also speeding up their investments in environmentally friendly technologies to reduce the impact of their operations on their surroundings. For instance, one of the biggest mining companies in the world, the British giant Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), is currently investigating the use of a bio-friendly material to replace the reliance on dirty coking coal for producing a titanium ore used to make plastics, inks, and fabrics.', ""Today, we'll take a look at some top mineral stocks to buy with the notable picks being Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

This involves fundamental analysis, studying financial statements, understanding business models, and assessing management quality. His investment methods have led to impressive profits over time. His knack for picking winning stocks became well-known during the 1980s, especially when he made profitable investments in the media and telecom industries.

This call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting today at 10:00 a.m. Central Time for a period of 1 week. Now I'd like to hand the call over to Don Zurbay."", 'Donald J. Zurbay', ""Thanks, John, and welcome, everyone, to Patterson's Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Conference Call. I will begin my remarks today with highlights of our consolidated results before providing more details on the performance of each of our segments.Our team executed well against the evolving backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty and other industry factors that had varied impacts on discrete categories within our Dental and Animal Health segments. I'll start with key highlights of strong performance in the quarter. In the Dental segment, Patterson's broad and resilient consumables portfolio enabled us to deliver sales growth above market growth amidst steady patient demand. And our core equipment category delivered solid year-over-year growth despite a tough comparison to last year's strong second quarter performance. In Animal Health, our market-leading production animal business achieved strong sales growth primarily due to the leading omnichannel presence that Patterson has built to best serve producers. And in both of our business segments, our value-added services categories, including our software offerings, achieved significant growth that outpaced overall sales and sales within the Dental and Animal Health segments. Offsetting these results, we experienced softer-than-expected demand in 2 areas of our business. Macroeconomic conditions impacted our performance in the high-tech dental equipment categories, and our companion animal business was impacted by a decline in vet clinic visits and spending. Ultimately, we delivered second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.50. We also returned $86 million in capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. Looking forward, we believe that macroeconomic and industry challenges are likely to persist for the duration of our fiscal year. We, therefore, have adjusted our fiscal 2024 guidance to reflect our revised expectations for the year. We now expect to deliver adjusted earnings in the range of $2.35 to $2.45 per diluted share, a decline of 4% at the midpoint of our previous range. We remain focused on executing against our proven strategy, which, as a reminder, is designed to achieve 4 core objectives: first, drive revenue growth above the current end market growth rates; second, build upon the progress we've made to enhance our margin performance; third, evolve our products, channels and services to best serve the customers in our end markets; and fourth, improve efficiency and optimization. Despite a more challenging macroeconomic environment during the second quarter, we continued investing across our business in service of our long-term strategic objectives. This includes investments in our distribution capabilities, software offerings and value-added services to further differentiate Patterson as a partner of choice for our customers. We are focused on managing Patterson for the long term because we are confident in the strength and resilience of our end markets and in Patterson's ability to perform for our customers and our shareholders. I'd like to touch on some of the targeted investments we made during the second quarter that we expect will drive our efficiency and optimization over the long term. First, we recently completed the expansion of a distribution facility dedicated to our Dental business in Canada. We believe the expanded facility in Montreal will enhance our ability to serve customers on the east side of the country and add state-of-the-art features that will drive efficiencies. Second, we successfully completed the implementation of our ERP system in Canada. This is an important milestone in our ERP rollout, connecting our U.S. and Canada operations to provide greater visibility across our North American operations to drive meaningful efficiencies. And finally, Patterson also continued to invest behind our robust suite of software solutions in both our Dental and Animal Health segments. As we've discussed previously, we believe the opportunity for growth within software is meaningful. And we're investing to build upon our strong foundation, add to our capabilities and address evolving customer preferences. In our fiscal 2024 second quarter, we added technical personnel and other resources to our dental software team and are pleased with the progress we have made toward an even stronger offering and customer experience. We're building a track record of driving returns from our strategic investments, and we expect that performance to continue. For example, last year, Patterson completed acquisitions of Dairy Tech and RSVP and ACT. Today, those businesses are performing even better than our expectations. The Dairy Tech owned brand is a positive margin contributor in our production animal business, and the RSVP platform for veterinarian staffing is solving today's most critical challenge for our animal health customers. And to meet that demand, we continue to expand RSVP to serve more of Patterson's customers. As we move through the second half of fiscal '24, we plan to continue to balance our investment strategy with cost discipline to calibrate our expenses appropriately within the macroeconomic environment. I am proud of the Patterson team in the way we are navigating a dynamic macroeconomic environment to deliver value for our customers and our shareholders. We continue to believe that the strength of our team, the resiliency of the Dental and Animal Health end markets and our comprehensive value proposition make Patterson well positioned to drive enhanced growth, profitability and value creation over the long term. Now I'll provide more detail on the performance of each of our 2 business segments during the fiscal second quarter. Let's start with Dental. In the second quarter, Dental segment internal sales declined 0.2% year-over-year. As I mentioned, our consumables category performed very well in the quarter with 3% internal sales growth, including the negative deflationary impact of certain infection control product prices. Excluding those infection control products, we saw a nearly 5% sales growth. We attribute this strong performance to a few key factors: first, steady patient traffic for standard dentistry; second, our long-term consistent commitment to strengthening our relationships with our customers; third, our broad and resilient dental consumables portfolio, including an expansive suite of private label products, which targets our customer base; and finally, the strong execution by our team. Taken together, these factors enabled Patterson to perform well in the consumables category and insulated us from macroeconomic headwinds that caused some patients to postpone specialty procedures. On the dental equipment side, internal sales declined 6% year-over-year. Patterson achieved continued growth in core equipment during the quarter, even on top of last year's strong growth. However, this growth was more than offset by declining sales of high-tech equipment during the quarter. Our digital and CAD/CAM businesses faced industry headwinds from the broader economic environment as well as lengthening upgrade cycles and continued pricing pressure. Moving forward, we are encouraged by the fact that our manufacturing partners have indicated long-term plans to invest and innovate in these important product categories. This is a testament to the continued long-term demand for these types of products. And when there's new innovation, Patterson has a leading capability to sell, finance, install and service all dental equipment. And finally, Dental internal sales in our value-added services category increased approximately 3% over the prior year period. Value-added services represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers that enhance the customer experience, drive loyalty and help make Patterson an indispensable partner to their practice. Dental value-added services continued to grow at a pace exceeding the rate of the Dental segment sales overall and remain a key strategic focus and significant growth opportunity for Patterson. We are dedicated to continuously deepening Patterson's Dental value proposition and positioning ourselves for continued success in a healthy and attractive market that is supported by enduring trends, including an aging population, a drive towards practice modernization and heightened awareness of the link between oral health and overall health. We remain confident in our team's ability to effectively navigate ongoing macroeconomic and industry challenges and achieve our long-term goals. Now let's move on to our Animal Health segment. During the second quarter, Patterson's Animal Health segment internal sales increased 0.2% year-over-year. Even in an environment of modest growth, we're seeing evidence that Patterson's deep and broad value proposition across species and multiple channels continues to be a driver of our success. In companion animal, our internal sales declined by low single digits as veterinary clinic business decreased and spending moderated. As I mentioned, we attribute this decrease to moderation in the companion animal industry [hastened] by a tough economic climate for consumers navigating inflation and other challenges. However, it's important to put this quarter into broader context of the long-term health of this end market. As we look ahead, we expect this market as a whole to grow in the low single digits over the long term, supported by positive long-term trends in pet parenting. On the production animal side, second quarter internal sales grew by mid-single digits. A strong performance in production reaffirms the strength of our omnichannel presence, highly tailored distribution strategy and comprehensive offering across animal species. Those strategies executed by our talented and tenured team enabled us to continue to win new business and outperform the broader production animal market. Secondarily, our performance also benefited because of the more historical timing of the annual fall run and movement of cattle to feed yards. Across the Animal Health segment, our value-added services category grew rapidly due to increased demand for our software solutions and equipment services as well as new programs to drive revenue and operational efficiency in freight. We're also confident that the opportunity for continued growth within software remains significant. And we continue to invest in existing solutions to better leverage our strong foundation, add to our capabilities and address evolving customer preferences. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin Barry to provide more detail on our financial results."", 'Kevin M. Barry', ""Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. In my prepared remarks this morning, I will cover the financial results for our second quarter of fiscal '24, which ended on October 28, 2023, and then conclude with our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. So let's begin by covering the results for our second quarter of fiscal '24. Consolidated reported sales for Patterson Companies in our fiscal '24 second quarter were $1.65 billion, an increase of 1.6% over the second quarter of 1 year ago. Internal sales, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation, contributions from recent acquisitions and the net impact of an interest rate swap, increased 1.0% compared to the same period last year. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '24 was 20.5%, an increase of 30 basis points compared to the prior year period. Beginning with our fiscal '24 second quarter, we have also provided adjusted gross margin, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts gross margin for the impact of the mark-to-market accounting related to our equipment financing portfolio and the associated interest rate swap hedging instrument. We will provide this additional non-GAAP financial measure going forward as it adjusts for the impact of interest rate fluctuations net of the mark-to-market swap adjustment within the P&L. In particular, this adjustment classifies the gain or loss on the interest rate swap from other income expense to net sales to align the swap impact with the impact on customer financing net sales. Remember, the accounting impact of the mark-to-market adjustment impacts our total company gross margin but not the gross margin within our business segment. And as before, the net impact of interest rate fluctuations between the swap and the equipment financing portfolio has a minimal impact on net income. For the second quarter of fiscal '24, our adjusted gross margin was 20.6% compared to 20.8% in the year-ago period. We provided these comparative numbers for the second quarter and on a year-to-date basis. And we have included reconciliations for the first quarter in today's press release. Importantly, during the second quarter of fiscal '24, both of our business units posted a year-over-year increase to their respective gross margins compared to the prior year period. The initiatives we have put in place to improve gross margin, working more closely with strategic vendors who reward us for our sales performance, drive improved mix, exercise expense discipline and leverage our cost structure, have translated into improved gross margins for both of our business units. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal '24 were 16.5% and unfavorable by 70 basis points compared to the second quarter of fiscal '23. In the second quarter of fiscal '24, our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 4.2%, a decrease of 80 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. Note that our adjusted operating margin now includes the impact of the interest rate swap adjustment mentioned previously. In the second half of fiscal '24, we plan to continue to effectively manage our expenses, while executing on the margin initiatives that have been yielding results within our business segments and for the company overall. Our adjusted tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal '24 was 25.1%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to the prior year period. Reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the second quarter of fiscal '24 was $40.0 million or $0.42 per diluted share. This compares to reported net income in the second quarter of last year of $54.1 million or $0.55 per diluted share. Adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. in the second quarter of fiscal '24 was $47.3 million or $0.50 per diluted share. This compares to $61.2 million or $0.63 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal '23. This decrease in adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fiscal second quarter was primarily due to lower sales of dental high-technology equipment and increased operating expenses compared to the prior year period. Now let's turn to our business segments, starting with the Dental business. In the second quarter of fiscal '24, internal sales for our Dental business decreased 0.2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '23. Internal sales of dental consumables in the fiscal second quarter increased 2.9% compared to 1 year ago despite being impacted by continued price deflation of certain infection control products. Internal sales of noninfection control products increased 4.7% in the second quarter of fiscal '24 compared to the year-ago period. This negative impact from infection control product deflation has steadily moderated over the past year. And we expect the year-over-year deflationary effect to continue moderating and fully normalize at the end of fiscal year '24. In the second quarter of fiscal '24, internal sales of dental equipment decreased 6.3% compared to 1 year ago. This quarter, core equipment posted positive growth that was more than offset by a decline in the digital X-ray and CAD/CAM product category as compared to the prior year period. We believe the year-over-year decline in these 2 categories was the result of macroeconomic concerns on some equipment purchasing decisions as well as selling price declines within the imaging categories. Internal sales of value-added services in the second quarter of fiscal '24 increased 3.1% over the prior year period, led by the continued growth of our software business and increased year-over-year contribution from our technical service team. Value-added services, including our software offerings, represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers that help make us an indispensable partner to their practice, and these valuable offerings are also mix favorable to our P&L. The adjusted operating margin in Dental was 9.4% in the second quarter of fiscal '24, which represents an 80 basis point decrease over the prior year period. While gross margins in the Dental business for the second quarter of fiscal '24 improved year-over-year, increased operating expenses related to our SAP implementation and warehouse expansion in Canada along with investments in our software and technical service business drove the unfavorability in adjusted operating margin on a year-over-year basis. Now let's move to our Animal Health segment. In the second quarter of fiscal '24, internal sales for our Animal Health business increased 0.2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '23. Internal sales for our companion animal business in the second quarter of fiscal '24 decreased 3.6% over the prior year period. Strong sales performance from our NVS business in the U.K. was more than offset by declines in the U.S. companion animal business. Internal sales for our production animal business in the fiscal second quarter increased 4.1% in the quarter compared to the prior year period. Our production animal team continues to execute well in the market, and our omnichannel approach across several species continues to pay off with sales growth above the overall market. The adjusted operating margin in our Animal Health segment was 3.6% in the fiscal '24 second quarter, a decrease of 20 basis points from the prior year period. Gross margins in our Animal Health segment were up in the fiscal '24 second quarter, and increased operating expenses on a year-over-year basis drove the operating margin decrease compared to the second quarter of fiscal '23. Now let me cover cash flow and balance sheet items. During the first 6 months of fiscal '24, our free cash flow improved by $28.0 million compared to the same period 1 year ago. This was primarily due to a decreased level of working capital in the first 6 months of fiscal '24 compared to the year-ago period. Turning now to capital allocation. Our capital spending in the first 6 months of fiscal '24 was $33.5 million and $6.7 million higher than the first 6 months of fiscal '23. This increased spending reflects the investments we are making in our distribution capabilities as well as software and value-added services. We continue to execute on our strategy to return cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter of fiscal '24, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per diluted share, which was then paid at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal '24. We also repurchased approximately $61 million of shares during the second quarter of fiscal '24, thereby returning a total of $85.9 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Let me conclude with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal '24. Today, we are revising our fiscal '24 GAAP earnings guidance to a range of $2.04 to $2.14 per diluted share and our adjusted earnings guidance range to $2.35 to $2.45 per diluted share. We have made these revisions to our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share guidance to account for the macroeconomic environment and uncertainty that we believe will persist for the remainder of our fiscal '24 year. Now I will turn the call back over to Don for some additional comments."", 'Donald J. Zurbay', 'Thanks, Kevin. Before we open it up for Q&A, I want to thank the entire Patterson team for their continued hard work and commitment to our strategy and serving our customers. Looking forward, the macroeconomic challenges we experienced during the second quarter do not change our strategic objectives or confidence in the health and attractiveness of our end markets. We continue to believe that Patterson is well positioned to drive enhanced growth, profitability and value creation as we execute our strategy over the long term. That concludes our prepared remarks. Kevin and I will be glad to take questions. Operator, please open the line.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Brandon Vazquez with William Blair.', 'Brandon Vazquez', ""Maybe just to start, there's a lot of moving pieces on the macro side. Kind of hard for us to see through it all, but you guys have a good exposure in both Dental and Animal Health. So maybe as you look at your updated guidance, can you talk a little bit about what is assumed in kind of the end markets for both of those segments for the rest of the year?"", 'Donald J. Zurbay', ""Yes, Brandon, thanks for the question. So I think if you kind of break things down a little bit, our consumables business on the Dental side, as you could see, we had another strong quarter. So we expect that trend to continue. On the equipment side, that's kind of where we're talking about the guidance revision is really the equipment, specifically the high-tech equipment. We're expecting that market to be somewhat soft as we go through the rest of our fiscal year or the second half. And then on the Animal Health side, another really strong performance in our production business, and there's a lot of good reasons for that, that are sustainable. So that business, we'd expect to benefit from that. And then on the companion side, we saw a little bit of a slowdown in visits and spend. Again, that's -- we think that's a bit of an enduring dynamic as we go through the rest of the year. Think if you kind of peel back from that, we're talking about and putting into place some cost actions to help ourselves in the back half of the year. And some of the disruption in the industry that everyone's been focused on will call -- will get us some benefit as well. So when you kind of put all that in the hopper, that got us back to a $0.10 reduction in the guidance as we move through the back half."", 'Brandon Vazquez', ""Okay. Great. And then maybe as a follow-up, kind of staying on equipment is, first, just clarifying, it sounds like -- in the past, we've talked about equipment a lot being lumpy. You might have a down quarter, then an up double digits quarter, but this seems like it's different. This might be a little bit more sustained decline through the rest of the year. So just clarifying that. And then any -- you guys have a unique view on financing a lot of this equipment. Any notable kind of read-throughs that you would make to the financing of the equipment business or delinquencies changing? Is it just higher interest rates are making people less willing to finance? Anything you could call out there?"", 'Donald J. Zurbay', ""Yes. And maybe I'll take the first question and kick it over to Kevin for the next. I think the dynamics in the equipment business for us, it was a little bit different. It's lumpy, as you know, and we've said that repeatedly. Hard to really take trends from 1 month, even 3 months. I think in this case, it was particularly interesting because a lot of the slowdown really happened at the -- right at the end of the quarter, which is what we would talk about in terms of the miss for the quarter on our expectations was really driven late in the quarter, which is, as you can imagine, harder to mitigate. But if you take the longer view on the year, that's where we think, okay, this is the dynamic we saw. We're going to be obviously monitoring that as we go through Q3 to see how much of that was really just timing versus slowdown, and then with some cost actions and then that sort of thing, we're going to -- the plan is to help mitigate that. And then maybe I'll let Kevin answer the question on the financing."", 'Kevin M. Barry', ""Yes. So like Don said, within the quarter here, we did see growth in our core equipment. And the declines that offset it were really in the 2D and 3D imaging and CAD/CAM spaces. And those are pressured. We saw some unit demand pressure as well as some continuing price pressure in the market, some downward ASP pressure that hit that. And from a financing standpoint, you're right, we do in-house financing, and it really is mostly directed towards those categories. So that's most of the stuff that we finance. And we're working internally. And we've obviously raised our interest rates as the overall external market's gone up. But we're looking internally and working with our manufacturers on promotional strategies to keep driving demand in those categories as we go through the year, and financing is certainly a lever that we'd be looking at."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel.', 'Jonathan David Block', ""Don, just for the guidance, you missed the quarter by roughly $0.08. Relative to consensus, you lowered by $0.10 for the full year. So the back part is sort of unchanged. And I know that can be a little bit difficult to tease out because you guys don't guide specifically by quarter. You're saying you expect the macro to remain challenging. I guess where I'm going with this is it would seem that the full year would come down by more because, again, the quarter miss was almost a full $0.10. So maybe you could just talk to that, like what do you -- what are you building in with anything as a buffer? And maybe what I'm trying to get at, are there any tailwinds from Henry Schein share gains in there that would be offsetting, call it, a weaker core as we work our way throughout fiscal '24?"", 'Donald J. Zurbay', ""Yes. Well, thanks, Jon. And one thing I would mention is that in this particular quarter, Q2, our -- so it's an $0.08 miss from Street consensus to our reported results. The -- in this quarter, I think there was some -- there was a bit of a disconnect between consensus and maybe where we were expecting things to be. So I would view it a little bit like that number. $0.08 is a bit less for the miss in our perspective. And then we're taking that out of the second half. But yes, definitely. Look, the 3 main things I'd call out in the second half that we're considering are the slowdown in the higher-tech equipment market but continued strength in our consumables -- in our dental consumables portfolio, continued strength in our production business, doing things -- some things to mitigate some of the weakness we're seeing in companion and then stack on top of that, the cost actions we plan to take in the second half and any benefit from some of the competitor's disruption that we're going to have in November, particularly. And that's kind of -- we put all that into the math formula, and that's -- those are the main things I would call out to some puts, some takes, but it nets out to the $0.10 move we did in the guidance."", 'Jonathan David Block', ""Okay. And maybe just to push you on Part B of that first question, your competitor's website was down from some point in mid-October. So you did have a good dental consumable number in a weakening market, up 5% ex PPE. So was that a -- sorry to frame it this way. Was that a clean number? Or do you think you saw some of that in the month of October? And have you started to -- have you continued to see some tailwinds for the month of November? And then I'll just ask my follow-up."", 'Donald J. Zurbay', 'Yes. So the benefit in October, it was a 2-week period. So the one thing I would caution against is too much calculation on simple math for any of this just because of the reality of putting new customers into your system, making transitions, customer ordering patterns, et cetera. It never works out that way. But the benefit for us in October was approximately $2 million of revenue.', 'Jonathan David Block', ""Got it. That's very helpful. And then just to shift gears a little bit. Can you guys just talk about the Dental -- how the backlog with equipment and where that sits? And I just called it out because you got now back-to-back negative dental equipment results, but core is doing well. The culprit seems to be high tech, but I think core usually has the longer like lead time. And so I'm just trying to match almost like core orders, if you would, to your results. So maybe if you could just touch on, to a certain extent, the backlog."", 'Donald J. Zurbay', ""Yes. Well, we're not -- we want to try to be very helpful here but not get too far ahead of ourselves on forward-looking type information. I guess I would just say that the dynamics we saw in the quarter which were that core had a -- core was solid for us, but that the high-tech equipment showed some softness, particularly late in the quarter. The backlog looks good. I think there's still good investment happening, but it's more targeted. And we expect that core could hang in there, that -- but then high tech, we're going to show some continued weakness here for a period of time."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird.', 'Jeffrey D. Johnson', ""So Don, maybe I can just ask for 2 clarifying questions from answers you just gave here. But one, you talked about a disconnect maybe between consensus in the second quarter versus what the company internal expectations might have been. EPS for the quarter was down 20% year-over-year. And so I guess, one, what would have been in the quarter that you would have internally been expecting such a sizable year-over-year contraction? And two, again, kind of -- is it just the cost actions and some of the cost savings that you're now going to be kind of ratcheting into the model that helps you get back to kind of flattish EPS or even low single-digit EPS growth that's implied in the second half guidance?"", 'Donald J. Zurbay', ""Yes. I think it's a combination of cost actions and some of the benefits we're seeing. Maybe I'll turn it over to Kevin Barry for a few more comments on that."", 'Kevin M. Barry', ""Yes. I think what I'd say about the quarter specifically, Jeff, in terms of our expectations, last year, in Q2, we had a few onetime benefits in stock comp and incentive compensation that we knew were not going to repeat this year. So we have that baked into our expectations. And then we also knew that here this quarter, we had some investment spending that was going to hit. And that really relates to the software investments we're making and some of the fulfillment center and ERP investments Don mentioned in his comments. So we knew that we had that swing happening in our OpEx line for the quarter. And then I think we're -- and so that was all baked into our expectations. And I think what deviated from our expectation like we've been saying was the high-tech equipment that really happened late in the quarter where it was a bit late for us to react to. So that was sort of what our Q2 estimate was built on."", 'Jeffrey D. Johnson', ""Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, just one follow-up just on the Schein question, the tailwinds, given their cyber issues. The $2 million number you cited, Don, for the back 2 quarters for the last 2 weeks of October, that's a number, frankly, that's in line, maybe even a little lower than I'm hearing from some of the private dealers that are out there that are probably 4, 5, 6x smaller than you. So that number just sounds very low to me. One, how do you get to that number? I'm sure it's hard to tell what customers may be -- are incremental or coming to you because of Schein cyber issues. But then how do we think about maybe the third quarter impact where obviously, those Schein issues have continued for several weeks into the quarter? I'm sure you don't wish ill on any of your competitors, but it is an issue that obviously we're watching closely. So how do we think about maybe the third quarter contribution from some of those share gains that might have happened on a temporary or, we'll see, longer-term basis?"", 'Donald J. Zurbay', ""Yes, Jeff, and appreciate it. And yes, I would reiterate what you just said. I never wish (inaudible) on any one particular competitor. I mean this does not benefit anyone really. But the -- there was 2 weeks left in the quarter when this really just started to come to light. And so again -- so for us, I would kind of point people to the idea that it's not linear that -- to get started. There's a lot going -- lot to that to get people into your fold to start their ordering to make sure that your own customers are serviced appropriately. And again, the other thing I'd say, frankly, is we compete vigorously for our -- to obtain business, but so do our competitors, including that competitor. And so they were working to keep their customers. So that's how you kind of look at that. I would say we're not going to, unfortunately, be able to give too much color on November, and we're actually -- we just finished the November month. So we're in the process of closing and starting to mine out all of that information. I would say that I think we have a pretty good process to get at a number with -- that has some precision to it. So I feel good about the $2 million number that we gave for the quarter. As you get into November, we'll see how that's played out. The thing that November had that October didn't is that some of the initial setup, some of the things that just sort of reacting to what happened was behind us. And we were able to focus a little bit more on just trying to help those customers out."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo with UBS.', 'Kevin Caliendo', ""I want to get back to the dental equipment stuff and talk a little bit about selling price versus delays in ordering and to account for how much is actual price -- average price declines versus decision-making. And if you think those decisions are being delayed or just canceled, meaning like are we waiting? Are we waiting for December? Or are we pushing everything out a year? Or are these just like this isn't the right time, come back to us next year or maybe would they expect prices to come down? I'm just trying to understand the behavior of what's happening in the market."", 'Kevin M. Barry', ""Yes. Kevin, this is Kevin. I think it's tough to make one blanket statement with kind of all the purchasing decisions that are out there in the market. I think what we're seeing in our business is sort of a combination of -- just when we look at the data, we do see some -- here in the quarter, we saw some unit price declines in our CAD/CAM business. We saw a bit more of a mix of trade-ups as opposed to new unit sales. And then in the -- I guess, at the imaging categories, we are seeing average selling prices come down a bit. And I think as we put all that together and we've built our forecast, there's always a replacement cycle on these types of equipment. There's -- for a practitioner at a certain point, they just need to replace the piece of equipment. That's how it's kind of baked into the baseline of our business. And like I said earlier, our teams are working on the right promotional activities to drive new demand over and above that as we go through the quarter to try to break through some of those purchasing headwinds we're seeing. And like I said, some of that might show up in financing promotions, other promotions that we would do. Now from a timing standpoint, does that manifest in the next 2 months, 6 months, 1 year? It kind of depends customer by customer what their individual situation is. What buoys us a bit is as we looked and as our results have come in, and we've been talking about the consumables business and even when we kind of strip out some of the market noise, we still see really good underlying patient demand for kind of the core hygiene restoration-type treatments that's kind of our bread and butter for our business. So we know that people are still going to the dentist, and that should -- that traffic should buoy the investment decisions of some of the practices out there."", 'Kevin Caliendo', 'Okay. And just a quick follow-up to that is, are you seeing different behaviors from DSOs versus sort of individual practices? Are DSOs being more conservative in any way, shape or form?', 'Kevin M. Barry', ""I think it's fair to say we've seen some of the expansion activity on the DSO side slow down compared to before. But I think the same dynamics play out. It really kind of depends practice by practice what their traffic is, what the kind of state of their equipment is and what opportunities they see to invest in their practice to drive better ROI, which our -- which is what our sales team is really good at working through with our customers. So I'd say there are probably a fewer de novos than prior years but similar dynamics within the core practices."", 'Kevin Caliendo', ""And if I can ask a follow-up to Jeff's question. Do you think that there is any permanent share changing that has happened due to what happened with your competitors and their cyber attack? Meaning like is there -- has there been any -- what you think is permanent market share gains for you because of what happened to them?"", 'Donald J. Zurbay', ""I think it's too early to tell on that. We had -- part of our strategic view on this was, as you can imagine, we would like to be looking at and working with potential customers that could be long term. So that's our focus. But it remains to be seen."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.', 'Sameer Patel', 'This is Sameer Patel on for Elizabeth Anderson. I just wanted to talk a little bit more about OpEx. You kind of mentioned that this is a bit elevated related to SAP integration as well as that facility expansion. What are some of the levers you can pull to moderate those costs? And also, what sort of step-down should we kind of expect in the next quarter related to the completion of those 2 projects?', 'Kevin M. Barry', ""Yes, I'll start, and Don can add any color he has. In terms of the step-down, I think as we go through the rest of the year, the timing of those investments we've been talking about are a bit offset. We'll see a wind down a bit in the expenses related to the SAP implementation and the Canada and NVS warehouse expansions as those have kind of gone live here right now. So we'll see some of that in Q3, but kind of moderating into Q4. But I think that's going to be a bit offset as our software investments were sort of built to accelerate more as we go through the rest of the year. Now -- and as Don has been saying, we're still very committed to that part of our business, and we see the real long-term potential there. So we're going to work to protect those investments as we go through the year. And offsetting that in terms of the cost actions that Don mentioned, it's the things that really are kind of under our discretionary spend. We're going to be looking more closely at discretionary travel and professional fees and things like that. That is -- when you're having a year like this, you tighten your belt on. And we'll be doing those sort of activities here as we go through the year to make sure that we can deliver on our commitments and also make space for the investments for the long term of the business."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Allen Lutz with Bank of America.', 'Allen Charles Lutz', ""One for Kevin. You said that equipment was weak over the past 2 weeks in the quarter. Can you talk about the consumables trend that you saw over the quarter? Was October any different than September? Is there anything to call out there? And then any insight into what you're seeing early in November."", 'Kevin M. Barry', ""I wouldn't call out any big trend shifts we saw month-to-month within the quarter. And I think Don kind of walked through the impact you saw very late in the quarter. But honestly, if you kind of step back a bit and look at our -- kind of how we've performed this whole fiscal year going back to May for us, we continue to see really strong performance by our team on the consumables line. We've had this PPE headwind that we've been working through. And when you strip that out, we think our team is performing and executing really well with our customers. We think we were on a trend to get some share even before the end of the quarter here. So I wouldn't call any big trend shifts within the quarter. I think our teams are executing really well, and it's showing up in that consumables performance."", 'Donald J. Zurbay', 'Yes. Just -- and maybe just one point of clarification. I think on the weakness we saw in the equipment sales were really more -- I would characterize it more as really for the month of October, not the last -- not really just the last 2 weeks.', 'Operator', 'Our final question comes from the line of John Stansel with JPMorgan.', 'John Paul Stansel', ""Just one on production. Can you give us a bit of a sense of how that should fit within cattle, pork, dairy? Sounds like -- I know pork was stronger last quarter. Kind of what was driving that acceleration in growth, it sounds like? And then any way to think about that from -- I know you've done a fair number of acquisitions in the production space. Would that mid-single-digit growth translate to more of an internal number? And then, I guess, final part of it, just anything to call out on the seasonal timing shift that you mentioned as we think about the back half?"", 'Kevin M. Barry', ""Yes, I'll try to cover that. I mean I think the one thing I'd say about our production animal business is -- and we've talked about this in prior calls. That team has done an excellent job of really kind of diversifying both the species that we serve and then how we reach the veterinarians and producers that work in those industries. And so quarter-to-quarter, we see some ups and downs between swine, dairy and beef. But really, this quarter was good performance across all. The timing of the fall run, it's always kind of the [cow straddles] our Q2 and Q3 every quarter, and so a little bit of art and science to figure out exactly what the impact is going to be. And so I think -- but again, I think the message really there is that we've got a team that's servicing their customers really well, gaining some share. And that diversified and kind of omnichannel presence we have is really the differentiator for us so we can really meet the customer where they are. On the acquisition side, the key acquisition that we've made in the production animal business is a company called Dairy Tech, which is an owned brand now that really services the dairy part of our business. And I'd say at this point, it's a relatively small part of that overall portfolio, but it's performing really well. It's providing a service that those dairy customers really value. That integration has gone really well from our expectations and how that team is performing. But from an overall numerical standpoint, it's relatively small from an overall impact."", 'Donald J. Zurbay', 'All right. Thank you for all -- sorry. Thanks for all your time today and interest in Patterson Companies, and we will talk to you in 3 months.', 'Operator', ""I'd like to thank our speakers for today's presentation, and thank you all for joining us.

If you want to skip our introduction to the mineral industry and some recent news, then take a look at the 5 Best Mineral Stocks To Buy Now. ', ""While money makes the world go around, the same can also be said of minerals. After all, the global economy is built on humanity's reliance on steel - which is made from a mineral. Then, silica, which is the backbone of the technology industry through its use in making semiconductors is also a mineral. As if this weren't enough, copper and lithium which are indispensable to humanity's fight to reduce global emissions, are also minerals."", 'This makes it clear that minerals go hand in hand with the economic prosperity of today and tomorrow. Naturally, the minerals and mining industry is also one of the biggest in the world when it comes to market value. For instance, data from The Business Research Company shows that the global mining market was worth $2.02 trillion in 2022 and it is slated to grow to sit at $2.1 trillion by the end of this year after growing through a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.1%. Then, the growth rate is expected to accelerate, as the research firm estimates that until 2027, the mining industry will have a 6.7% CAGR and a final value of $2.78 trillion.', ""Within the mineral industry, there are several different kinds of products that are produced. Minerals are generally defined as naturally occurring solid materials with defined atomic structures, which means that they cover nearly every metal known to humanity. This broad definition also means that the mineral industry is quite diverse with several different use cases, such as those we've mentioned above."", ""Delving deeper, while minerals are essential for the world's normal functioning today as well as future initiatives, capital expenditure within the mining sector varies with fluctuations within the commodities market. When prices are high, firms are encouraged to spend more to beef up their production, and when prices fall, they cut down on investments. Data from McKinsey shows that global capital expenditures in mining were cut in half from $260 billion in 2012 to $130 billion in 2020. This is concerning since progression with renewable and alternative energy sources is dependent on vibrant and robust investments in global mining capabilities. McKinsey adds that from 2016, the dollar value of mining capital expenditures started to grow but their percentage with respect to operational cash flows still remained low."", ""Shifting gears to narrow down our focus on mineral companies, one of the most important companies right now is Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB). Albemarle is crucial to the minerals industry since it is one of the biggest suppliers of lithium in the world. Lithium, if you're unaware, is crucial for the electric vehicle industry, and Albemarle is known for its crucial relationship with car companies including the electric vehicle giant Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, while everyone agrees that the long term prospects of lithium are quite strong due to its use in batteries, 2023 has been a rather surprising year for the industry. This is because lithium prices have considerably dropped this year, and as we mentioned above when prices drop, capital expenditures are also often reduced. You can also read 10 Most Profitable Lithium Stocks Now for more details about lithium stocks."", 'The scale of the 2023 lithium price crash is not widely reported either. As an example, consider the average price of battery grade lithium carbonate in China. This stood at $84,500 per metric ton in November 2022, but a year later, has dropped by a rather stunning 78% to sit at $18,630 as of late November 2023. At the heart of this drop is the current global investment and economic climate, as high interest rates have also put the brakes on global electric vehicle demand and high inflation coupled with labor market uncertainty has limited the amount of money that people can fork out themselves for pricey car purchases.', 'At the same time, mining and minerals firms are also speeding up their investments in environmentally friendly technologies to reduce the impact of their operations on their surroundings. For instance, one of the biggest mining companies in the world, the British giant Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), is currently investigating the use of a bio-friendly material to replace the reliance on dirty coking coal for producing a titanium ore used to make plastics, inks, and fabrics.', ""Today, we'll take a look at some top mineral stocks to buy with the notable picks being Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating aging populations, you may go to 5 Countries with The Lowest Retirement Ages in The World.', 'According to the World Health Organization, the population of individuals aged 65 or older will outnumber those under the age of 15 by 2024. In the case of the United States of America, every Baby Boomer will have turned 65 or older by 2030. Most of these Boomers will be using some sort of Medicare for health coverage, and 40 million are yet to sign up for it. Yet many others will also be receiving social security benefits.', 'In line with several other nations grappling with aging populations, the US hasn’t been all prepared to cater to an aging demographic. As of today, a typical American allocates approximately 18 years to retirement, with an average lifespan expectancy of 76 years,. A health trends report from CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) underscores the urgency of this matter, projecting that by 2060, the population over the age of 85 will nearly triple. This demographic shift places a growing demand on healthcare services, as evidenced by the report indicating that one in four doctor visits involves individuals aged 65 and above. Furthermore, hospital stays for this age group are twice as likely, highlighting the escalating healthcare needs of the aging population.', 'Many organizations have been taking initiatives to cater to this burgeoning demographic. For instance, Minute Clinic, a walk-in clinic by CVS Health, has been transforming itself to offer age-friendly care to patients.', '“We have been preparing for this moment, and with the touch points we have, are uniquely positioned to support older adults.”', '-Sree Chaguturu, MD, Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer for CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS).', 'Not only has the organization been transforming itself within four walls, but has also been working on other factors that can worsen health issues in individuals. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) reports having invested more than $1.2 billion in affordable housing for Americans in order to provide stability in their lives and reduce financial strain that can potentially impact their health.', 'Similarly, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has also been actively involved in strengthening healthcare systems to help advance global equity and deal with aging populations. The organization has been helping Japan, one of the oldest countries in the world, deal with its disease burden. Reportedly, around 63% of seniors aged 65 and above grapple with multi-morbidity, a condition that significantly affects both functional ability and quality of life, and, unfortunately, leads to increased mortality rates.', 'Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), in its efforts to improve healthy life expectancy in the region, has initiated the Japan Smart Healthy Aging Quick Fire Challenge held in 2022. This challenge invited innovators from across the globe to provide potential solutions that can help increase healthy life expectancy in the country. The winner of the Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), announced in July 2023, is Qure.ai, a global leader in AI-based radiology solutions. Qure.ai developed an AI-based head CT interpretation software, qER, that not only detects abnormalities in non-contrast head CT scans but also identifies Large Vessel Occlusion (LVO) on NCCT.', 'Despite efforts made by health organizations, it must be noted that the global strain caused by the aging population extends beyond healthcare alone. These aging populations have been straining social safety nets as well, such as the social security system. By 2033, social security funds are expected to be depleted in the USA. At this point, benefits would be reduced by 25%, a direct impact of the increasing burden of old-aged populations. In 1960, there were 5.1 workers per beneficiary in the US. Today, the ratio has dropped to 2.8 workers only.', 'Consequently, many countries including the United States, have been reassessing and revising their retirement age policies. With increased life expectancy and changing workforce dynamics, the traditional retirement age may no longer align with the economic and demographic realities of the 21st century.

While some countries proved to be fit, with a significant portion of their population exhibiting normal weight, a substantial portion of the world's population still struggles with the repercussions of being overweight and underweight."", 'Obesity has become a worldwide issue, with over 1.9 billion adults classified as overweight or obese in 2016. On the other hand, a staggering 462 million adults were reported to be underweight in 2016.\xa0 These alarming statistics emphasize the burgeoning role of the health and wellness industry in promoting fitness and addressing concerns such as obesity and malnutrition worldwide.', 'According to a report by Precedence Research, the global health and wellness market was worth $5.24 trillion in 2022. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.5%\xa0 from 2023 to 2032 and reach $8.95 trillion in 2032. The growth is driven by rising consumer spending on health and wellness products and services. Some of the factors influencing the growth include the burden of physical and mental diseases, rising personal disposable income, increased awareness regarding health and wellness, government expenditure on healthcare infrastructure, growing demand for healthy products, increased awareness of personal hygiene, sedentary lifestyles, and rising prevalence of chronic diseases. The integration of technology into the health and wellness market has led to the advent of fitness bands, trackers, and other digital devices.', 'The prevalence of chronic diseases is a key market driver. These chronic diseases are usually caused due to exposure to unhealthy habits including lack of exercise, tobacco use, and unhealthy diet among others. Regular exercise and physical activity can enhance our health, physical fitness, and quality of life. It lowers the risk of mortality and chronic diseases. The health and wellness industry continuously integrates technology into its products and services to enhance the consumer experience, by providing them with top-notch services. One example is the wearable technology being developed to monitor health such as an artificial pancreas. It automatically releases insulin and monitors blood sugar levels for people with diabetes.', ""Aligning with the evolving demand for wearable technologies, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) launched the Google Pixel Watch in 2022 with the integration of its top-notch technology and Fitbit's best health and fitness features. On October 7, the company launched a new model of the watch, the Google Pixel Watch 2, developed with advanced and improved features. It provides faster performance and better heart rate tracking service than any other wearable on the market."", 'Regionally, the market was dominated by North America in 2022. North America is projected to sustain its dominance over the forecasted period. The growth is driven by multiple factors including high disposable income, improved health consciousness, and increased demand for healthy products. Asia Pacific is estimated to be the most opportunistic market with significant growth potential, driven by a growing population, rising urbanization, and rapid industrialization.', ""Some of the major companies leading the health and wellness market include Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY),\xa0 Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), and Garmin Ltd. (NYSE:GRMN).

The ECG app can help customers make informed decisions about their health and fitness goals and identify any potential problems early on.', 'Lack of physical activity can lead to obesity which in turn can strain the heart and lead to potential damage to blood vessels, contributing to elevated blood pressure. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is a leading medical devices company working to solve this problem.

With economists predicting a more stable economic environment, investors can now anticipate a normalization of interest rates. In recent weeks, there has been a noticeable change in investor sentiment, acknowledging the growing possibility of rate cuts. According to the federal funds futures market, traders are actively pricing in higher probabilities of the first interest rate cut occurring in the first half of 2024.', 'In the realm of investment strategies, one time-tested approach is value investing, which centers around identifying stocks trading below their intrinsic value. This methodology is grounded in the notion that the market frequently misjudges stock prices in the short term, creating opportunities for long-term investors.', ""A specific facet of value investing that has garnered considerable attention is the pursuit of high earnings yield stocks. This metric is derived by dividing earnings per share (EPS) by the stock price and expressing it as a percentage. Essentially, earnings yield signifies the return on investment an investor could anticipate based on a company's earnings. A high earnings yield suggests that the stock is priced relatively lower compared to its earnings potential."", 'When assessing stocks, especially if other factors are comparable, investors may prioritize those with a higher earnings yield. The rationale is that stocks with a superior earnings yield have the potential to deliver comparatively higher returns. A few noteworthy stocks possessing high earnings yield include Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation PPC, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd RCL, Matador Resources Company MTDR and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company GT.', ""Crucially, earnings yield serves as a valuable tool for comparing the performance of a market index with the 10-year Treasury yield. If the yield of the market index surpasses the 10-year Treasury yield, stocks can be considered undervalued compared to bonds. In such a scenario, opting for investment in the stock market becomes a more attractive proposition for a value investor. It's important to highlight that earnings yield is a significant metric for investors with exposure to both stocks and bonds. In fact, in this context, earnings yield can provide more insightful information than the traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, as the former facilitates the comparison of stocks with fixed-income securities."", 'Harnessing the power of value investing through earnings yield enables investors to make well-informed decisions and build a resilient investment portfolio.', 'We have set\xa0an\xa0Earnings Yield greater than 10%\xa0as our primary screening criterion but it alone cannot be used for picking stocks that have the potential to generate solid returns.

If you want to skip our analysis of stock quality and want to jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, then take a look at the 5 Best Quality Stocks To Buy Now. ', ""When it comes to analyzing stocks, there are a myriad of tools available to professional and retail investors. Two of the most popular approaches are value investing and growth investing. Both of these are widely used, and starting from value investing, it simply involves analyzing stocks that have the potential to appreciate in the future. A stock's value is typically defined by several metrics such as its price to earnings ratio and its fair value. The former measures the premium that the market is paying over a firm's ability to earn profit and the latter is a subjective analysis that factors in future cash flows and business operations to wager a guess at the stock price. The higher the fair value, the safer an investment is and the less margin exists for making a loss if a buying decision is made."", 'Growth stocks, on the other hand, have high P/E ratios. This is because investors expect their share price to significantly appreciate in the future based on market advantages and technological strengths among other factors. Therefore, they are willing to pay higher share prices now with the hope that future earnings growth will also push the share price up.', 'One approach that receives less attention when compared to growth or value investing is Quality Investing. While the former two have defined metrics that make for easy classification, quality stocks are much harder to define. Despite this, there are dozens of quality factor ETFs that are operated by different entities. Some of the biggest quality factor ETFs in terms of total assets are iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF (BATS:QUAL), iShares MSCI Intl Quality Factor ETF (NYSE:IQLT), and Invesco S&P 500 Quality ETF (NYSE:SPHQ). Each of these has different criteria for stock selections, and as you might have guessed, they also target different stock indexes.', ""So, it's clear that we'll have to turn elsewhere to see what stock quality is all about. One place where we might find answers is academia. On this front, a research paper from 2017 takes a look at several signals that are used by investors to measure stock quality. The researchers, associated with Research Affiliates, LLC,\xa0 used three primary criteria to measure quality. These consider whether a quality factor has been previously discussed in academia, a steadfastness against shifting definitions, and a globally agnostic impact on stock performance. They also analyzed quality factor indexes and narrowed down seven metrics that are typically defined as a quality indicator. These are profitability, earnings stability, capital structure, growth, accounting quality, shareholder payouts or stock dilution, and investment strategies. Then, the researchers checked which of these factors were actually leading to return premiums and found that profitability, accounting, payouts, and investment strategies were the ones that made the final cut."", ""Another take on what really makes a stock a quality stock comes from Cliff Asness' AQR Capital Management. AQR is one of the biggest hedge funds in the world, and Insider Monkey's research shows that as of Q3 2023 end, the firm's investment portfolio was worth a whopping $8 billion. According to AQR, quality stocks generally have higher prices, and it points out that an investment strategy called Quality Minus Junk has the potential to deliver high returns in both the U.S. and abroad. This approach sees an investor use a long/short approach, to go long on quality stocks and short the others."", ""The QMJ strategy is part of a research paper written by Mr. Asness himself, and it defines Quality as conditional on a firm's profitability, growth, safety, and shareholder payouts. For what it's worth, AQR's top stock picks during the third quarter were Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Analyzing them with respect to Mr. Asness' formula, all these firms are profitable, they continue to deliver growth despite bringing in billions in revenue, are safe due to fortress balance sheets, and regularly pay dividends.

(AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced it is working with Accenture (NYSE: ACN) to help Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the U.S. and Canada, to move a substantial portion of its IT infrastructure to AWS as part of the company’s multiyear cloud migration.', 'As part of this initiative, Merck selected AWS as its preferred cloud services provider and Accenture as its professional services partner to transition core applications like SAP, machine learning (ML), and data warehouses to AWS—enabling Merck to help accelerate scientific research and discovery.', 'Merck has been working with AWS and Accenture since 2021 to help transform its value chain and accelerate its cloud migrations efforts. Merck is using the breadth and depth of AWS analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) services for key initiatives across its Research, Manufacturing, Human Health, and Animal Health divisions, as well as its internal global support functions. For example, Merck is using a manufacturing platform built on AWS to help identify complex defects, such as cracks or the presence of foreign particles, where there is limited training data and to reduce false positives for rejected medicines. Merck used Amazon SageMaker, a fully managed service to build, train, and deploy ML models, to develop an inference pipeline for a manufacturing platform known as HawkAVI that derives insights from terabytes of inspection data from machines across manufacturing sites. This use of generative AI and ML has enabled Merck to improve product availability and yield, accelerate rapid root cause analysis, and reduce false rejection rates, which leads to more availability of its products.', 'Working in collaboration with Accenture, Merck also selected AWS to strengthen its high-performance computing (HPC) capabilities to accelerate therapeutic discovery. Through HPC on AWS and AWS HealthOmics, a purpose-built service for biological insights and automation, Merck can scale its protein model prediction and omics analytical work and run HealthOmics managed workflows such as AlphaFold to speed drug discovery. Merck also migrated all SAP workloads to AWS—including SAP Business Warehouse, SAP HANA Sidecar, and SAP Master Data Governance—to increase resilience and adapt resourcing requirements to meet business demands.', 'To support business operations across the company, Merck’s cloud modernization program drives training, diversity, and development through a new operating model to improve the employee experience. Merck also created an internal academy to upskill its employees on cloud technologies including AWS services and to advance the company’s technology transformation.', 'Moving forward, efficiencies achieved through the cloud migration will also enable Merck to redirect resources to other strategic programs. AWS and Accenture developed a systematic, value-driven approach based on data from previously modernized systems to track savings realized from rehosted, retired, or modernized applications. This expansive framework enables the team to point to any application and identify the precise savings generated by an action. Merck has already used this framework to free up significant IT operational savings that can support other strategic initiatives.', '""Merck’s goal is to ensure our medicines and vaccines reach customers and patients faster while meeting our high-quality standards. Our work with AWS and Accenture is helping us transform the way we operate at every stage of the value chain—from therapeutics discovery and development to delivery,"" said Dave Williams, executive vice president, chief information and digital officer, Merck. ""The true power of moving to AWS will come from our ability to use technologies like generative AI to make more data-driven decisions in support of patients.""', '""Using machine learning and generative AI has the potential to accelerate innovations and increase efficiencies, to drive scientist and clinician productivity, and to streamline clinical processes to enhance research, drug development, and scientific breakthroughs,"" said Dan Sheeran, general manager for Healthcare and Life Sciences at AWS.

Thermo Fisher, which is down 10%, they provide everything from medical equipment to software and analytical tools, that's one company to take a look at within that sector."", 'And then the semiconductor, that has also been at the heart of the destocking trend that we have seen this year.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. This means that investors who purchase Cigna Group's shares on or after the 5th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 21st of December."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.23 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$4.92 per share. Last year's total dividend payments show that Cigna Group has a trailing yield of 1.9% on the current share price of $262.87. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Cigna Group's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Cigna Group has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Cigna Group ', ""Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Fortunately Cigna Group's payout ratio is modest, at just 27% of profit. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Luckily it paid out just 13% of its free cash flow last year."", ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. For this reason, we're glad to see Cigna Group's earnings per share have risen 15% per annum over the last five years. Earnings per share have been growing rapidly and the company is retaining a majority of its earnings within the business. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Cigna Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 62% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Cigna Group? We love that Cigna Group is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about Cigna Group, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it."", ""With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces.

Well, I think we've heard it from Nike already that what they're talking about is where they got over inventory last year, they're being much more tighter in their distribution to the market. So I think we'll see them continue to return to a more full price cadence. We heard a bit from them when they reported their last quarter.

They already have really high brand awareness. Everyone knows Foot Locker. But this kind of serves to elevate the brand awareness further. And I think what it does for them is it allows them to go deeper into basketball. And as they think about the strategy for next year and the years beyond, it really hinges on continuing to become the go to source for the basketball category, which is really their bread and butter. It's their sweet spot. And this kind of further reinforces that relationship."", ""With the India entry, it's interesting. I think it's not particularly meaningful right now, but I think it potentially reflects a broader strategy where they have opportunity to expand internationally. And the important thing here is that it's a license agreement. So it's not capital intensive. They're putting their capital into refreshing their stores in the US. But there's still an opportunity to leverage the brand awareness they have, leverage a growing footwear market internationally without having to put a lot of capital outlay towards it.""]"

In the interview, Krumpelman discusses how rising dividend yields were previously a huge concern for investors; however, with recent economic changes, the yields have decreased. Such has ultimately pushed the percentage of stocks trading above the 10-day or 50-day moving average from 10% to 70% and 20% for stocks trading on a 200-day moving average.

Krumpelman suggests that the market has broadened, which is a good sign that the market is moving in the right direction.', 'Furthermore, in response to a discussion on the appropriate stock portfolio, Krumpelman discussed his barbell approach to investing. He mentioned that both growth and value stocks are interesting, but to him, investing in particular companies trading at attractive valuations is key.

We then studied each of the disadvantages separately and included them in our list in no particular order. We have included specific details, explaining the implications of each disadvantage.', 'It is to be noted that we are in no way coercing our readers to shy away from investing in long-term investments. Instead, the list focuses on the general drawbacks of investing in a long-term portfolio. Our list contains relevant details highlighting how certain disadvantages can be minimized or prevented.', 'According to our methodology, people investing in long-term investments tend to face several liquidity constraints. Liquidity constraints refer to the limitations investors face when trying to liquidate their assets. Long-term investments are less liquid, and therefore, investors must set aside an emergency fund to prevent such issues.', 'Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) are some of the top blue chip stocks to buy according to Wall Street analysts.', ""Investors investing in long-term investments often have to let go of profitable short-term opportunities or other profitable asset classes or portfolios. However, this disadvantage is strictly based on an investor's investment goals. An investor with a solid investment goal and portfolio may not be impacted as much as an investor with a lack of direction."", 'Long-term investors must wait for their securities to mature before they are allowed to get their cash. Having lock-in periods limits the ability of investors to divert resources and are often unable to account for changing events. However, stocks or mutual equity funds happen to offer a certain level of flexibility to investors.', 'According to our methodology, long-term investments come with a great degree of emotional stress. Long-term investments can be stressful especially when markets are fluctuating or volatile. While long-term investors do enjoy the benefit of recovering from losses, the process may be a nerve-wracking experience.', ""Investing in long-term investments is a huge commitment, that often hinders the ability of being able to diversify an investor's portfolio. Diversification is particularly important to minimize risk, therefore, investors directing their resources to long-term investments may have to miss out on potential gains from other investments, such as young and high-growth tech companies, which could potentially be more riskier."", 'Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pfizer Inc.

While Skyrizi is approved for CD, regulatory applications for UC are under review in the United States, with approval anticipated in 2024.', 'With approvals for many new indications, sales of these drugs could be higher in future quarters. These have the potential to replace blockbuster drug Humira, which has started facing generic erosion in the United States since early 2023.

These states are also host to some of the top US cities for young population.\xa0With the average age of the US population on the rise, there are many cities that have a rising aging population. Many cities are marketed as ideal for retirement planning due to their facilities and senior citizen-friendly planning. You can check out the 20 Cities with Highest Elderly Population here. With an overall aging US population as Baby Boomers enter their old age, US demographics now predict that older citizens will outnumber children by the time 2030 rolls up. This is mainly due to declining fertility rates, as people opt to have no children or just one child. According to the 2022 US Census, the current population of individuals under 35 years old stands at 43.8%. This percentage reflects a continuous decline, a trend observed over the past three decades. In the 90s, the percentage of the US population aged under 35 was about 54%. With declining birth rates and longer life expectancy rates, the US is set to have an increasingly older population with every passing year.', 'Many of the youngest cities in the world are characterized as university towns, where a significant number of students attend colleges and universities. Additionally, cities situated near military garrisons also qualify for inclusion in our list of the cities with the highest young population, given that a substantial portion of the serving staff tends to be under the age of 30. Cities offering affordable living standards, youth-friendly tax policies, and higher employment opportunities become attractive havens for young individuals seeking to establish themselves and build a career.

Utah is home to multiple Fortune 500 companies as well as other small and large businesses due to its positive business policies.', 'Cities that offer more affordable educational facilities, lower mortgage rates, and improved employment opportunities are increasingly becoming focal points for young individuals seeking to live in such areas. According to the Youth & Money in the USA survey, two major concerns impacting the financial well-being of young Americans are inflation and mortgage rates. Around half of young Americans believe that inflation has a very negative impact on their financial security. Similarly, 39% share this sentiment concerning mortgage prices. Interestingly, despite 89% of young adults currently not owning a home, over 50% of them think purchasing a home is much more challenging compared to when their parents entered the job market.

As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias.

It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank.

The nine ladies dancing, however, held steady — mostly because of “contractual differences,” Agati said, noting that PNC tabulates some of the performers using multi-year contracts, and the lords’ contract is coming up for renewal this year.', 'While there have been some major wins for union members in labor negotiations this year, things haven’t gone as swimmingly for those earning the federal minimum wage, which hasn’t budged since 2009. As such, the milking maids’ prices remained flat once again.', 'However, some of the largest increases went to the birds: The partridge in the pear tree went up by 13.9%, an increase driven entirely by the pear tree (a proxy for housing costs), which went up 15%.', 'The half-dozen geese-a-laying, which have seen their prices soar after backyard farming gained popularity during the pandemic, saw their costs rise by 8.3%, primarily due to higher feed and fuel costs and other rising business expenses, according to PNC.', 'But the pair of turtle doves saw the biggest jump, at 25%, an increase that reflects their rarity and limited supply.', 'This year’s index also showed calmer waters in a frequently volatile component: the seven swans-a-swimming. Prices for the swans held steady, but remain the second-most expensive in the index, at $13,125.', 'Because of their high cost and volatility, the swans are subbed out of the index to achieve a “core” holiday CPI reading. The core Christmas Price Index rose 3.7% this year, a far more muted increase than last year’s 15.4% gain.', 'However, plenty of volatility could come in the months after ringing in the new year, Agati said.', '“I think the big wild card for next year is whether we ultimately tip into recession or not,” she said. “It’s the most highly anticipated recession that hasn’t materialized.”', 'PNC still holds the view that a mild recession is possible, but it’s also likely that the United States could experience a period of sluggish economic growth, she added.', 'Ultimately, it could all come down to the consumer, said Agati.', '“The Christmas Price Index is a very specialty gift basket.

Alternatively, if the stock reverses at the level again, and moves below the $31.50 level, investors may want to wait for another opportunity.', 'The trifecta of fair valuation, upward trending earnings revisions, and technical momentum setup makes Pinterest a worthy consideration for any investor’s portfolio.', 'The fashion brand Guess has been struggling in recent years, unable to move its stock price higher. Unfortunately, the current outlook is not much improved as sales are forecast to remain flat in the coming years, and earnings estimate revisions are decidedly lower, giving the stock a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) recommendation.', 'Because of the lackluster company expectations, and inherent challenges of the fashion and apparel business, Guess stock should be avoided until a significant turn in the data.', 'Guess is an American fashion brand known for its clothing, accessories, and footwear. Founded in 1981, it is recognized for its iconic denim products and distinctive style. Guess operates globally and has a reputation for its trendy and edgy youthful designs.', 'Over the last ten years Guess stock is essentially unchanged, down -5% over that period. This is below the industry returns, which should be noted are not much better at just 9% over the last ten years, and significantly worse than the broad market. However, GES has paid a dividend since 2008, which today stands at a hefty 5.6% yield.', 'The poor industry performance speaks to the inherent challenges associated with the fashion industry. Because trends regularly come and go, it is hard for the brands to maintain steady and enduring sales growth. As is seen in GES, where sales growth is flat over the last 11 years, these instances can be brutal for shareholders.', 'Sales this year and next are expected to continue mostly unchanged, with FY24 expecting 2.2% YoY growth and FY25 forecasting 1.9% YoY growth. With no sales growth prospects, I think it is likely that Guess stock will continue to languish as is has the last decade.', 'Earnings estimates aren’t encouraging either, reflected by the Zacks #5 (Strong Sell Rating). Current quarter earnings have been revised lower by -7.5% and are expected to drop -8% YoY to $1.6 per share. FY23 earnings have been lowered by -7.6% and are projected to grow just 1.4% YoY to $2.78 per share.', 'Guess is a part of the Textile – Apparel Industry, which sits in the Bottom 30% (175 out of 251) of the Zacks Industry Rank.', 'This year has been an exceptional one in the stock market, and thus there are a litany of exciting companies to pick from. This makes Guess a stock that is very much worth avoiding, as it has few if any bullish catalysts currently.', 'However, Guess does have a well-known brand, and still does over $2.7 billion in annual sales indicating it still maintains some relevance in the fashion world. Furthermore, it is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 8x, which is below the industry average of 14.6x and its 10-year median of 17.5x.', 'Thus, if Guess can instigate a growth campaign and sway analysts to improve earnings estimates, it could at some point be an interesting investment. However, for now investors should look elsewhere for opportunities.', 'Americans opened up their wallets in the busy holiday shopping period, thereby fueling economic growth and squashing concerns about an imminent recession. Black Friday sales touched record highs as online sales picked up after retailers extended their deals beyond brick-and-mortar outlets.', 'According to a report from MasterCard, in-store sales during Black Friday advanced 1.1% year over year, while online sales climbed 8.5%. MasterCard added that overall Black Friday sales increased 2.5%. Adobe Analytics, meanwhile, said that Black Friday sales came in at a record $9.8 billion across the length and breadth of the country, while e-commerce spending jumped 7.5% from a year earlier.', 'Thanks to both online and offline deals, price-conscious consumers splurged a lot more during this year’s Thanksgiving holiday shopping compared to last year, when higher food and gas prices impacted their propensity to spend. Consumers were on a shopping spree and spent heavily on items such as televisions, smartwatches, gaming, and toys, to name a few.', 'But it’s just not about Black Friday sales, the National Retail Federation (NRF) earlier stated that consumers will spend between $957.3 billion and $966.6 billion on various retail products throughout November and December, which will be an uptick of 3% and 4% over the same period last year. NRF, in reality, found out that a greater number of consumers have already started to spend on holiday items such as gifts and decorations since October.', 'Consumers, in the meantime, are spending more on nonobligatory items and are eventually boosting retail sales solely because the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary policy has made incremental progress in curbing price pressures. With inflation showing signs of cooling down and the Fed now expected to pause interest rate hikes, consumers are all set to splurge even more in the near term. Moreover, retailers have already lured bargain-hunting customers with enticing Cyber Monday deals.', 'Hence, courtesy of an increase in consumer outlays, retailers are positioned to gain as spending plays a crucial role in determining their revenues.

Well, the 2023 holiday season commenced with a resounding cheer as a whopping 200.4 million shoppers swarmed both physical stores and online platforms from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday.This record-breaking feat, unveiled in a survey conducted by the National Retail Federation (“NRF”), not only outshone last year's remarkable figure of 196.7 million but also surpassed the NRF's optimistic projection of 182 million shoppers.According to the NRF report, 134.2 million customers engaged in online shopping, an increase from the 130.2 million recorded in the previous year. However, the in-store foot traffic slightly dipped to 121.4 million this year from 122.7 million in 2022. The report also highlighted that shoppers, on average, spent around $321.41 on holiday-related purchases throughout the weekend.NRF president and CEO Matthew Shay highlighted the resilience of consumers and the robustness of the economy, stating, “The period between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday reflects the continued resilience of consumers and strength of the economy.” The robust turnout exceeded expectations, underscoring not only the festive spirit but also the economic vitality of the holiday season.The holiday season holds significant importance for retailers as it contributes a substantial portion of their annual revenues. Consequently, retailers proactively address logistical and inventory challenges while devising comprehensive strategies to deliver a seamless shopping experience, both in physical stores and online. To cater to consumers' product preferences, retailers focus on restocking shelves with high-demand merchandise and significantly invest in digitization.With the economic backdrop in favor, now is an opportune time for investors to explore retail stocks poised for post-record Thanksgiving turnout success.

With economists predicting a more stable economic environment, investors can now anticipate a normalization of interest rates. In recent weeks, there has been a noticeable change in investor sentiment, acknowledging the growing possibility of rate cuts. According to the federal funds futures market, traders are actively pricing in higher probabilities of the first interest rate cut occurring in the first half of 2024.', 'In the realm of investment strategies, one time-tested approach is value investing, which centers around identifying stocks trading below their intrinsic value. This methodology is grounded in the notion that the market frequently misjudges stock prices in the short term, creating opportunities for long-term investors.', ""A specific facet of value investing that has garnered considerable attention is the pursuit of high earnings yield stocks. This metric is derived by dividing earnings per share (EPS) by the stock price and expressing it as a percentage. Essentially, earnings yield signifies the return on investment an investor could anticipate based on a company's earnings. A high earnings yield suggests that the stock is priced relatively lower compared to its earnings potential."", 'When assessing stocks, especially if other factors are comparable, investors may prioritize those with a higher earnings yield. The rationale is that stocks with a superior earnings yield have the potential to deliver comparatively higher returns. A few noteworthy stocks possessing high earnings yield include Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation PPC, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd RCL, Matador Resources Company MTDR and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company GT.', ""Crucially, earnings yield serves as a valuable tool for comparing the performance of a market index with the 10-year Treasury yield. If the yield of the market index surpasses the 10-year Treasury yield, stocks can be considered undervalued compared to bonds. In such a scenario, opting for investment in the stock market becomes a more attractive proposition for a value investor. It's important to highlight that earnings yield is a significant metric for investors with exposure to both stocks and bonds. In fact, in this context, earnings yield can provide more insightful information than the traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, as the former facilitates the comparison of stocks with fixed-income securities."", 'Harnessing the power of value investing through earnings yield enables investors to make well-informed decisions and build a resilient investment portfolio.', 'We have set\xa0an\xa0Earnings Yield greater than 10%\xa0as our primary screening criterion but it alone cannot be used for picking stocks that have the potential to generate solid returns.

Analog Devices' chips are also incorporated into wireless infrastructure equipment."", 'Analog Devices Inc has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 2003, with dividends currently distributed on a quarterly basis.

Over the past decade, the annual dividends per share growth rate stands at 9.30%. Based on these figures, the 5-year yield on cost for Analog Devices Inc stock is approximately 3.02%.', ""The sustainability of dividends is often gauged by examining the payout ratio. Analog Devices Inc's dividend payout ratio is currently 0.51, meaning that the company distributes just over half of its earnings as dividends, retaining the rest for growth and as a buffer against downturns.

It's like having a steady paycheck while also having the opportunity for your investment to increase in worth. Income-focused strategies have encountered significant challenges throughout this year. Factors such as market volatility, economic shifts, or changes in investment landscapes might have made it harder for these strategies to deliver the anticipated levels of income or profits.

It's a popular way to get dividends by buying a stock right before the company pays out its dividend and then selling it shortly after. People are into this strategy because they aim to grab that dividend payment without holding onto the stock for a long time. It's like a quick way to catch those dividends as they come and then move on to the next opportunity.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 States with the Best Economy Right Now.', ""According to a\xa0report by Goldman Sachs, the economy of the United States is on track to beat expectations as the year 2023 comes to a close. The GDP of the United States is expected to expand by 2.1% in 2024, compared to the expected 1%. The report adds that the country is on track to defy any recession expectations, with a probability of only 15% for the next 12 months. Goldman Sachs' research highlights that the primary concern to economists was the Fed pushing interest rates to slow the demand so it could meet supply. However, despite rising concerns, the Fed put the interest rate hike on hold. The Fed will likely keep interest rates steady until a cut during the last quarter of 2024, supported by a continuous 25-basis-point cut per quarter till the Fed funds rate reaches 3.5%-3.75 % in the second quarter of 2026. The report also adds that consumer spending is expected to grow in 2024, as real disposable income is projected to grow by 3%, supported by a 1% increase in the real wage. You can also check out the states with the lowest unemployment rate."", ""Despite rising expectations of a recession at the start of 2023, the US economy has pulled back stronger, especially during the third quarter. On October 26, Reuters\xa0reported that the United States economy grew by almost 5% in the third quarter. A rebound in residential investment also supported the growth after nine consecutive quarters of contraction. The economy's performance indicates people's resilience to continue spending despite interest rate hikes. While some economists argue that growth may slow down in the last quarter of 2023, the United States may bid farewell to the year with a soft landing."", 'On November 28, Reuters\xa0reported that the Fed shows no signs of altering interest rates as the fiscal year ends. While the Fed is consistent with its effort in trying to achieve a soft landing for the economy, there is a possibility of an interest rate increase if an unexpected resurgence of price pressures occurs. Fed Governor Christopher Waller suggested that the Fed is confident that the economy is on track to bring the inflation rate to 2% and added that it is achievable without having to experience a rise in the unemployment rate, currently recorded at 3.9%.', ""Adobe Inc.

257,6fc928dc-8e3e-318b-81fd-ff5c5de29014,V,2023-11-30,Visa and Mastercard: Holding Both Is Wise,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-mastercard-holding-both-wise-161022654.html,1701274222,STORY,"['V', 'MA']","['Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) are in a constant battle for advancement in the payments industry. However, they are both equally compelling investments for a range of contrasting reasons. My analysis revealed that Mastercard presents more forward growth prospects, but Visa has a stable and stalwart-like nature that is compelling for risk-averse investors.', ""Visa's network spans over 200 countries. A large part of the company's domination results from its entrenched global operational capabilities, which are unmatched by Mastercard. Three main areas could be considered when analyzing Visa's dominant position in its industry: a highly advanced network, strong institutional relationships and acquisitions and partnerships."", 'The company\'s advanced network is often referred to as VisaNet. Arguably this is the center of its operational dominance. The network can handle more than 65,0000 transaction messages per second. According to the company\'s website, the ""technology infrastructure powers more than 138 billion payments annually, each in just a few milliseconds."" Over the last five years, Visa has invested close to $9 billion to further strengthen core technologies and launch new projects.', 'Visa partners with banks and credit unions across the globe. The purpose of this is to issue Visa-branded credit, debit and prepaid cards. Major specific partnerships include Bank of America, offering the Bank of America Customized Cash Rewards credit card, and Chase, offering the Chase Sapphire Preferred and Chase Sapphire Reserve cards. According to CardRates, as of November 2023, Visa has over 312 million cards in circulation, which are accepted by over 40 million merchants.', ""The company has made over 30 acquisitions in total. I am going to focus on three crucial acquisitions to give readers an understanding of the effectiveness of Visa's acquisition strategy. Visa Europe was reacquired in 2016 for $23.4 billion. This reacquisition streamlined Visa's operations and global presence, specifically providing uniformity. CyberSource was acquired in 2010 for around $2 billionn. This provided Visa with a strong position during the e-commerce boom with online payment and fraud management. Tink was acquired in 2021 for 1.8 billion euros ($1.97 billion). This bolstered Visa's open banking and financial data capabilities, contributing to its advancement in digital finance."", ""Mastercard operates in over 210 countries. However, the company is notably smaller than Visa with a market cap of around $385 billion compared to Visa's market cap of $520 billion. Mastercard's relatively smaller size arguably gives it more room to innovate. There are three core areas I have selected to compare the two companies: the operational advancements that Mastercard is focusing on, the difference in growth rates and both companies' dependence on U.S. versus international markets."", ""The company's noteworthy investments in advanced financial services include blockchain, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. It is worth noting that both companies are going to have competitive crossover in almost all areas, but specific patents and acquisitions will be what differentiate the two operationally."", 'For example, Mastercard has unique patents for maintaining transaction privacy using blockchain. Some of the patents it owns related to blockchain include fraud prevention, anonymous transactions and payment card verification. The company currently has around 90 blockchain patents with around 300 blockchain patents pending.', ""Mastercard has incorporated AI into its cybersecurity efforts for over 10 years. Safety Net, a worldwide tool to strengthen cybersecurity, utilizes AI and has prevented over 100 million attempted fraudulent transactions in the first half of 2023, according to Mastercard's own reports. A biometric checkout program is currently in a pilot phase, which will eventually allow shoppers worldwide to make payments through facial or hand recognition."", 'Both Visa and Mastercard are competing on all of these technological advancements. The room for innovation here could potentially see Mastercard edge closer to a more dominant position if it effectively advances its technologies in ways favored by consumers.', ""However, the main selling point of Mastercard stock versus Visa is arguably in the revenue growth rates of the companies compared. Mastercard has slightly stronger revenue growth on a five-year and a one-year basis. Compare 12.60% for Mastercard's five-year revenue growth rate with Visa's 11.70%, or 15.60% for Mastercard's one-year revenue growth rate against Visa's 14.10%."", 'Even more interesting is the average growth of transaction volumes. Based on a report by Khaveen Investments, Mastercard saw an average growth rate in transaction volumes of 9.1% from 2016 to 2019, while Visa only had a transaction volume growth rate of 4.9% over the same period.', 'In 2022, Mastercard recoreded North American revenue of $7.81 billion and international revenue of $14.43 billion, meaning 35% of all revenue came from the U.S. Visa had a North American revenue of $12.85 billion and international revenue of $14.64 billion, meaning 44% of all revenue came from the U.S. For that reason, Visa may be slightly more suitable for risk-averse investors, as the U.S. market is generally more stable than its foreign counterparts.', 'The GF Score ranks both companies as 97 out of 100, indicating high outperformance potential. However, there are key differences that mark both investments as worthy on slightly different parameters.', ""Visa has a higher gross and operating margin than Mastercard, with a gross margin of 79.89% compared to Mastercard's 75.89%. Visa's operating margin is 67.15% and Mastercard's is 57.96%."", ""This reveals an interesting story, with Mastercard presenting higher top-line growth and Visa showing stronger overall profit margins. In some sense, these factors equally balance both companies in terms of financial merit related to income and profit. Due to Visa's size and dominance, it arguably has more ability to be capital efficient, hence slower revenue growth, but more effective profit strategies."", ""When analyzing credit ratios, Mastercard is in a worse position with a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.48 compared to Visa's 0.98. Mastercard's cash-to-debt ratio has been in a long-term downtrend since 2009. Visa's cash-to-debt ratio has also been in a long-term downtrend, but also has a five-year uptrend, rising from 0.7 to 0.98 today."", 'Visa has considerably less total liabilities than Mastercard. As of September, Visa has total liabilities of 57.2% and total equity of 42.8%, whereas as of December 2022, Mastercard has total liabilities of 83.53% and total equity of 16.47%. Part of this is likely because, with higher market saturation, Visa can afford to take on less debt and remain competitive, whereas Mastercard is still racing to expand and grow to levels Visa has already reached.', 'The valuation standing of both companies is more nuanced. The GF Value chart shows Mastercard to be modestly undervalued.', 'The GF Value chart shows Visa to be fairly valued.', 'This seems correct to me and perhaps presents a slightly more compelling reason to invest in Mastercard right now over Visa. Still, there are further considerations that warrant analysis that make me confident in owning both companies.', ""For example, while Mastercard's current stock price is slightly below its all-time high, it has a price-earnnings ratio of 35.74, which is worse than 82.46% of companies in the credit services industry. Visa, on the other hand, has a price-earnings ratio of 30.61, which is worse than 78.27% of competitors"", 'By discounted cash flow analysis using earnings per share without non-recurring items, Visa is closer to intrinsic value than Mastercard.', ""While Visa and Mastercard are certainly not value investments, their relative values related to growth and operational competition make them almost equal by my analysis, as confirmed by GuruFocus' innate data tools."", 'A thorough operational and financial comparison of Visa and Mastercard reveals to me that both are almost equal counterparts. Visa offers more stability, milder inflated value and the dominant position with margin power. Mastercard offers higher growth rates and operational agility, but also comes with a more grandiose valuation and more international dependence, hence more overall risk, in my opinion.', 'Since I am quite a risk-averse investor, I hold Visa in my portfolio at about double the weight of my Mastercard shares. That being said, I can see a strong argument that Mastercard could present better overall long-term growth, and I do not doubt that both investments are relatively stable enough to hold either on their own.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

If you want to skip our introduction to the mineral industry and some recent news, then take a look at the 5 Best Mineral Stocks To Buy Now. ', ""While money makes the world go around, the same can also be said of minerals. After all, the global economy is built on humanity's reliance on steel - which is made from a mineral. Then, silica, which is the backbone of the technology industry through its use in making semiconductors is also a mineral. As if this weren't enough, copper and lithium which are indispensable to humanity's fight to reduce global emissions, are also minerals."", 'This makes it clear that minerals go hand in hand with the economic prosperity of today and tomorrow. Naturally, the minerals and mining industry is also one of the biggest in the world when it comes to market value. For instance, data from The Business Research Company shows that the global mining market was worth $2.02 trillion in 2022 and it is slated to grow to sit at $2.1 trillion by the end of this year after growing through a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.1%. Then, the growth rate is expected to accelerate, as the research firm estimates that until 2027, the mining industry will have a 6.7% CAGR and a final value of $2.78 trillion.', ""Within the mineral industry, there are several different kinds of products that are produced. Minerals are generally defined as naturally occurring solid materials with defined atomic structures, which means that they cover nearly every metal known to humanity. This broad definition also means that the mineral industry is quite diverse with several different use cases, such as those we've mentioned above."", ""Delving deeper, while minerals are essential for the world's normal functioning today as well as future initiatives, capital expenditure within the mining sector varies with fluctuations within the commodities market. When prices are high, firms are encouraged to spend more to beef up their production, and when prices fall, they cut down on investments. Data from McKinsey shows that global capital expenditures in mining were cut in half from $260 billion in 2012 to $130 billion in 2020. This is concerning since progression with renewable and alternative energy sources is dependent on vibrant and robust investments in global mining capabilities. McKinsey adds that from 2016, the dollar value of mining capital expenditures started to grow but their percentage with respect to operational cash flows still remained low."", ""Shifting gears to narrow down our focus on mineral companies, one of the most important companies right now is Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB). Albemarle is crucial to the minerals industry since it is one of the biggest suppliers of lithium in the world. Lithium, if you're unaware, is crucial for the electric vehicle industry, and Albemarle is known for its crucial relationship with car companies including the electric vehicle giant Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, while everyone agrees that the long term prospects of lithium are quite strong due to its use in batteries, 2023 has been a rather surprising year for the industry. This is because lithium prices have considerably dropped this year, and as we mentioned above when prices drop, capital expenditures are also often reduced. You can also read 10 Most Profitable Lithium Stocks Now for more details about lithium stocks."", 'The scale of the 2023 lithium price crash is not widely reported either. As an example, consider the average price of battery grade lithium carbonate in China. This stood at $84,500 per metric ton in November 2022, but a year later, has dropped by a rather stunning 78% to sit at $18,630 as of late November 2023. At the heart of this drop is the current global investment and economic climate, as high interest rates have also put the brakes on global electric vehicle demand and high inflation coupled with labor market uncertainty has limited the amount of money that people can fork out themselves for pricey car purchases.', 'At the same time, mining and minerals firms are also speeding up their investments in environmentally friendly technologies to reduce the impact of their operations on their surroundings. For instance, one of the biggest mining companies in the world, the British giant Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), is currently investigating the use of a bio-friendly material to replace the reliance on dirty coking coal for producing a titanium ore used to make plastics, inks, and fabrics.', ""Today, we'll take a look at some top mineral stocks to buy with the notable picks being Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

If you want to skip our overview of seasonal investing and some recent stock market news, then take a look at 5 Best Seasonal Stocks To Buy Now. ', 'Seasonality and cyclicality are unavoidable parts of the climate, the economy, and business operations. Just like summers and winters regularly take place each year, an economy undergoes periods of economic growth and economic contraction. Similarly, businesses are often limited to selling their products in certain months, and this ends up affecting their supply chain as well.', ""One of the strongest examples of seasonal revenue is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple's fiscal year ends in September, and the month is also central to the firm's business cycle. Apple regularly upgrades its iPhone in September, and October marks the start of its first quarter. Naturally, sales of the iPhone are highest when the smartphone is launched, and Apple's revenue is the highest during Q1 as well. This cyclical nature also translates downstream into Apple's supply chain in the form of orders made to build the iPhone."", ""Before Apple's first fiscal quarter, orders made to companies such as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) pick up during the quarter ending in September and they slow down during a year's first calendar quarter after the U.S. technology giant has finished making most of the orders for its latest products. Looking at the firm's latest revenue figures. its first quarter of fiscal year 2023 revenue stood at $117 billion and went on to drop to $94 billion, $81 billion, and $89 billion during the succeeding quarters, respectively."", ""The next question to ask after keeping this seasonality in mind is if it affects stock performance. After all, if some quarters consistently see higher revenues, then one might also imagine that the stock price gains more during these time periods. Well, data compiled by the analytics platform Tradewell shows that October is the best month to buy Apple's shares as they historically return 5.35% on average. For a three month period, the months between November and February see the stock post the most returns, sitting at 8.67%. Likewise, the three months between May and August are the worst months for the shares. Comparing these figures with the nature of Apple's business shows that the business cycle does appear to create short term opportunities for stock market profit taking."", ""Similar perturbations are also present in the economy as we alluded to above. These come in the form of cyclicality, a data pattern that is similar to seasonality. The difference between seasonality and cyclicality is that seasonal patterns follow a set time period (like the summer months or Apple's quarterly revenue) while cyclical patterns are not time constrained. What this means is that an economy can show peak growth and peak drops over any time period, whether it's one month or one year - with the only certainty being that these extreme highs and lows will take place."", 'Coming back to the stock market, seasonality is one of the most favorite topics in academia, with researchers consistently studying any factor that could influence share price returns. One such research paper comes from the Ivey Business School of the University of Western Ontario. It analyzed value and growth stock performance of equities listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX (now NYSE American) stock exchanges to discover that not only is seasonality present across returns generated by both value and growth stocks, but also that they exhibit different seasonal patterns.', 'The researchers concluded:', 'The paper finds that both value and growth stocks exhibit seasonal strength in January and the first half of the year, but the effect is stronger for the value stocks. In the second half of the year, however, the opposite is true. Growth stocks exhibit weaker performance than value stocks. Seasonality is also observed in the value premium, which exhibits peak seasonal strength in the June to July period for NASDAQ and NYSE and relative seasonal weakness in the remaining months of the year. AMEX stocks, on the other hand, exhibit seasonal strength in the first seven months of the year and seasonal weakness thereafter, with AMEX value premium turning negative, which is unlike the NYSE and NASDAQ value premiums that always remain positive. While the findings are, in general, consistent with the January seasonal strength of value stocks found by Loughran (1997), there is no evidence that NASDAQ stocks drive the results. The findings, which are pervasive across all markets examined, are consistent with the gamesmanship hypothesis and portfolio rebalancing by professional portfolio managers. However, they are not consistent with the argument that it may be higher risk that drives the outperformance of value stocks. This is because while portfolio managers seem to rebalance aggressively into value stocks at the beginning of the year, they switch out of growth stocks more aggressively in the second half of the year (which they would not do if growth stocks had lower risk than value stocks), thus negating the argument that value stocks bear more risk that growth stocks.', ""Today, we'll look at some seasonal stocks and the top picks are Amazon.com, Inc.

People are living longer, so that money has to cover a longer period. Making matters worse, income generated using tried-and-true retirement planning approaches may not cover expenses these days. That means seniors must dip into principal to meet living expenses.', ""The tried-and-true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn't work today."", 'Years ago, investors at or close to retirement could put money into fixed-income assets and depend on appealing yields to generate consistent, solid pay streams to fund a comfortable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s floated around 6.50%, but unfortunately, those days of being able to exclusively rely on Treasury yields to fund retirement income are over.', 'While this yield reduction may not seem drastic, it adds up: for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries, the rate drop means a difference in yield of more than $1 million.', ""And lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035."", ""So what can retirees do? You could dramatically reduce your expenses, and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don't diminish. On the other hand, you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady, higher-rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields."", 'Invest in Dividend Stocks', 'Dividend-paying stocks from low-risk, high-quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace low risk, low yielding Treasury and bond options.', 'Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.', 'One way to identify suitable candidates is to look for stocks with an average dividend yield of 3%, and positive average annual dividend growth. Many stocks increase dividends over time, helping to offset the effects of inflation.', 'Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.', ""Cummins (CMI) is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.68 per share, with a dividend yield of 3%. This compares to the Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines industry's yield of 0% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.71%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 7.01%. Check Cummins (CMI) dividend history here>>>"", ""Magna (MGA) is paying out a dividend of $0.46 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.42% compared to the Automotive - Original Equipment industry's yield of 0% and the S&P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 2.22% over the past year. Check Magna (MGA) dividend history here>>>"", ""Currently paying a dividend of $0.47 per share, NextEra Energy (NEE) has a dividend yield of 3.22%.

Check NextEra Energy (NEE) dividend history here>>>"", ""But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?"", 'The fact is that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds. To counterbalance this, invest in superior quality dividend stocks that not only can grow over time but more significantly, can also decrease your overall portfolio volatility with respect to the broader stock market.', 'A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies, especially blue chip stocks, increase their dividends over time, helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income.', 'Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.', 'If you\'re thinking, ""I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,"" make sure to do your homework. It\'s important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges.', 'Bottom Line', 'Pursuing a dividend investing strategy can help protect your retirement portfolio. Whether you choose to invest in stocks or through low-fee mutual funds or ETFs, this approach can potentially help you achieve a more secure and enjoyable retirement.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""Let the chips fall where they may,"" Musk declared at one point, after urging any marketers who don\'t like what he has to stop advertising on X. ""Don\'t advertise,"" he repeatedly taunted.', ""In the audience was also X CEO Linda Yaccarino, who has been the proverbial pain sponge for the company.

Notably, on Monday, Musk tentatively agreed that his Starlink satellites, responsible for broadband internet communications, could be utilized in the Gaza Strip with the approval from the Israeli government. Musk said on the Dealbook Summit stage that his trip to Israel was “not an apology tour,"" and that he has “no problem being hated"" in response to a question about his endorsement of the antisemitic conspiracy theory. He said he was not anti-semitic, and cited his post saying as much shortly after the controversy began.', 'While Musk seemed defensive, and a bit chaotic coming on stage, he admitted that his ""actual truth"" tweet was ""perhaps one of the most foolish— if not the most foolish thing— I\'ve ever done on the platform.""', '""It might be literally the worst and dumbest post that I\'ve ever done,"" Musk said.', 'Do you have insight to share?

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.', ""Shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -3.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +10.8% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, to which Devon Energy belongs, has lost 4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share, indicating a change of -1.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.5% over the last 30 days.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $5.92 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -28.8%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.', 'For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.67 indicates a change of +12.6% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.6%.', ""Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Devon Energy is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)."", ""The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:"", '12 Month EPS', 'Projected Revenue Growth', ""While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth."", 'For Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.08 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $15.35 billion and $16.12 billion estimates indicate -19.9% and +5% changes, respectively.', 'Last Reported Results and Surprise History', 'Devon Energy reported revenues of $3.84 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -29.4%. EPS of $1.65 for the same period compares with $2.18 a year ago.', 'Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.03 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -4.82%. The EPS surprise was +5.77%.', 'Over the last four quarters, Devon Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.', 'Valuation', ""Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects."", ""Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is."", 'As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'Devon Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

The PEP came into effect at the very beginning of 2021 and started off with a client base of only two employers.', 'Since then, client growth has exhibited an impressive trend based on which Aon PEP currently supports 70-plus employers extending 401(k) plans, an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan, to more than 50,000 employees. Also, the participating employers of the PEP hail from diversified industries, some of which are biotech and life sciences, manufacturing, services, consumer products, energy, technology and transportation.

311,2b36c0c0-8318-3c03-b307-1ad8a18a3989,PLD,2023-11-30,Should You Hold Prologis (PLD) Stock in Your Portfolio?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hold-prologis-pld-stock-portfolio-155200595.html,1701273120,STORY,['PLD'],"[""Prologis PLD is well-poised to capitalize on favorable conditions in the industrial real estate market due to its strong operational foundation and substantial scale. As a prominent player in this asset class, the company experiences healthy demand for its industrial real estate offerings, as evidenced by the strong performance of leasing and rental rates.Over the past years, due to the surge in e-commerce, the expansion of various industries and continuous endeavors to enhance supply-chain effectiveness, there has been a notable increase in the need for logistics infrastructure and streamlined distribution networks. This upswing has contributed to the thriving state of the industrial real estate market, which has been proving advantageous for companies like Prologis, STAG Industrial STAG and First Industrial Realty Trust FR.The future of supply chains hinges on their ability to remain resilient. Consequently, in the long run, apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, logistics real estate is expected to benefit from an increase in inventory levels. This opens up opportunities for industrial property owners, including Prologis, STAG Industrial and First Industrial Realty, to thrive in a favorable market environment.In particular, PLD provides industrial distribution warehouse space in some of the busiest distribution markets worldwide. The properties of the company are typically located in large, supply-constrained infill markets in close proximity to airports, seaports and ground transportation facilities, which facilitates the rapid distribution of customers’ products. The solid demand for Prologis’ strategically located facilities has driven healthy operating performance over the past few quarters.In the third quarter of 2023, 46.4 million square feet (msf) of leases commenced in the company’s owned and managed portfolio, with 42.3 msf in the operating portfolio and 4.1 msf in the development portfolio. The average occupancy level in Prologis’ owned and managed portfolio remained high at 97.1%. For 2023, management expects occupancy in the band of 97.25-97.50%. We estimate occupancy to be 97.3%. Also, our estimate points to a year-over-year increase of 38.7% in rental revenues in the current year.With healthy operating fundamentals in industrial real estate markets, Prologis has capitalized on growth opportunities through acquisitions and developments. Its investments over the years comprise a wide array, including the largest M&A transactions in the real estate sector and individual off-market deals below $5 million.In June 2023, it concluded the buyout of nearly 14 million square feet of industrial properties from opportunistic real estate funds affiliated with Blackstone for cash consideration of $3.1 billion. The move significantly enhanced Prologis’ presence in the key U.S. markets, poising it well for long-term growth.Moreover, the company’s share of building acquisitions amounted to $238 million in the nine months that ended Sep 30, 2023. Development stabilization aggregated $1.92 billion, while development starts totaled $1.35 billion. For 2023, the company anticipates acquisitions at Prologis share between $500 million and $800 million, while development starts are expected in the range of $3-$3.5 billion.PLD maintains a healthy balance sheet position with ample flexibility. This industrial REIT’s liquidity amounted to $6.9 billion as of Sep 30, 2023. The company's weighted average interest rate on its share of the total debt was 2.9%, with a weighted average term of 9.5 years. It has no significant debt maturities until 2026. Given its balance sheet strength and prudent financial management, the company is well-poised to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Moreover, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and Prologis is committed to that. In the last five years, Prologis has increased its dividend five times, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 13.58%. Check Prologis’ dividend history here.Analysts seem bullish regarding PLD’s funds from operations (FFO) growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2023 FFO per share has been revised marginally upward over the past two months to $5.60. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of Prologis have rallied 13.4% over the past month, outperforming the industry’s increase of 11.9%."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'However, with the asset category being attractive even during challenging times, there is a development boom in many markets. This high supply is likely to fuel competition and curb pricing power. New supply is likely to create pressure on vacancy levels and rent growth to some extent in some of the company’s markets in the upcoming quarters.Moreover, a high interest rate is a concern for Prologis. Elevated rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. The company’s consolidated debt as of Sep 30, 2023 was $27.6 billion. For 2023, our estimate indicates a significant year-over-year increase in the company’s interest expenses. Further, with high interest rates in place, the dividend payout might seem less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money market accounts.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Zimmer Biomet Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.991. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures decreased 0.7% to close at $75.54 per barrel, while natural gas prices moved down 3.6% to end at $2.855 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).The crude price action remained negative for the fifth week running after government data showed a build in inventories and record-high crude production.

The acquired assets currently generate an average production of around 2,800 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day. NOG anticipates a slight decline in production to an average of 2,500 Boe per day in 2024.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. In light of that, when we looked at Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Boston Scientific is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.079 = US$2.3b ÷ (US$34b - US$4.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Therefore, Boston Scientific has an ROCE of 7.9%.

If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", ""On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Boston Scientific doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 11% over the last five years. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line."", ""On a side note, Boston Scientific has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 13% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Some would claim this reduces the business' efficiency at generating ROCE since it is now funding more of the operations with its own money."", ""To conclude, we've found that Boston Scientific is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling.

CF is a progressive, multi-organ disease that affects the lungs, liver, pancreas, GI tract, sinuses, sweat glands and reproductive tract. CF is caused by a defective and/or missing CFTR protein resulting from certain mutations in the\xa0CFTR\xa0gene. Children must inherit two defective\xa0CFTR\xa0genes — one from each parent — to have CF, and these mutations can be identified by a genetic test. While there are many different types of\xa0CFTR\xa0mutations that can cause the disease, the vast majority of people with CF have at least one\xa0F508del\xa0mutation. CFTR mutations lead to CF by causing the CFTR protein to be defective or by leading to a shortage or absence of CFTR protein at the cell surface. The defective function and/or absence of CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cells in a number of organs. In the lungs, this leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus, chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage that eventually leads to death for many patients. The median age of death is in the 30s, but with treatment, projected survival is improving.', 'About PrKALYDECO® (ivacaftor)', 'In people with certain types of mutations in the CFTR gene, the CFTR protein at the cell surface does not function properly. Known as a CFTR potentiator, ivacaftor is an oral medicine designed to facilitate the ability of CFTR proteins to transport salt and water across the cell membrane, which helps hydrate and clear mucus from the airways.

Our sources included reports published by Forbes, Investopedia, CNBC, and the Corporate Finance Institute. We then studied each of the disadvantages separately and included them in our list in no particular order. We have included specific details, explaining the implications of each disadvantage.', 'It is to be noted that we are in no way coercing our readers to shy away from investing in long-term investments. Instead, the list focuses on the general drawbacks of investing in a long-term portfolio. Our list contains relevant details highlighting how certain disadvantages can be minimized or prevented.', 'According to our methodology, people investing in long-term investments tend to face several liquidity constraints. Liquidity constraints refer to the limitations investors face when trying to liquidate their assets. Long-term investments are less liquid, and therefore, investors must set aside an emergency fund to prevent such issues.', 'Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) are some of the top blue chip stocks to buy according to Wall Street analysts.', ""Investors investing in long-term investments often have to let go of profitable short-term opportunities or other profitable asset classes or portfolios. However, this disadvantage is strictly based on an investor's investment goals. An investor with a solid investment goal and portfolio may not be impacted as much as an investor with a lack of direction."", 'Long-term investors must wait for their securities to mature before they are allowed to get their cash. Having lock-in periods limits the ability of investors to divert resources and are often unable to account for changing events. However, stocks or mutual equity funds happen to offer a certain level of flexibility to investors.', 'According to our methodology, long-term investments come with a great degree of emotional stress. Long-term investments can be stressful especially when markets are fluctuating or volatile. While long-term investors do enjoy the benefit of recovering from losses, the process may be a nerve-wracking experience.', ""Investing in long-term investments is a huge commitment, that often hinders the ability of being able to diversify an investor's portfolio. Diversification is particularly important to minimize risk, therefore, investors directing their resources to long-term investments may have to miss out on potential gains from other investments, such as young and high-growth tech companies, which could potentially be more riskier."", 'Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pfizer Inc.

The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which Coke belongs, has gained 8.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.48 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.7%.

Goodarzi', 'Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a very strong first quarter and have great momentum innovating on our platform across the company. Total revenue grew 15%, driven by Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 18% and Consumer Group revenue growth of 25%. This was partially offset by Credit Karma revenue decline of 5%, in line with our expectations for Q1 given the macroeconomic environment.With the strong start to the year, we are reiterating our full year guidance for fiscal year 2024. Consumer Group revenue growth reflects a strong finish to the tax extension season. We remain focused on transforming the assisted consumer and business tax categories with TurboTax Live. Our innovation in tax has accelerated in several areas. First, the Credit Karma platform is leveraging data and AI to deliver personalized experiences and compelling tax offers. Second is the innovation with TurboTax Live to deliver speed and confidence to prior year assisted customers, particularly with full service, where we can get taxes done in as little as an hour using data, AI and our expert platform at scale. And third, Intuit Assist, our GenAI-powered financial assistance, helping customers in key areas where confidence matters most. For example, understanding their refund or getting answers to their questions as if they\'re talking to an expert. We ran many experiments during the extension season, and the learnings give us confidence in our game plan to win this tax season. We believe this is Intuit\'s most exciting era yet. Five years ago, we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform with data and AI core to fueling innovation across our platform. We\'re delivering experiences where the hard work is done for you with a gateway to human expertise, powering our customers\' prosperity and accelerating penetration of our $300 billion in TAM. The launch of Intuit Assist is the result of years of investment in data and AI. At the core of our platform is powerful, relevant data. Intuit has incredibly rich longitudinal, transactional and behavioral data for our 100 million customers. We have 500,000 customer and financial attributes per small business and 60,000 financial and tax attributes per consumer on our platform. And with our GenAI operating system, GenOS, we empower Intuit technologists to create breakthrough AI experiences across the platform. This includes utilizing our own powerful financial LLM as well as those from other leaders in GenAI, which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers with accuracy and speed in a cost-efficient way. We are creating a future of ""done for you"", a future where the hard work is done automagically on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their financial success. Intuit Assist powered by GenAI is critical to delivering unparalleled benefits for our customers over the next decade. Let me share a few updates on Intuit Assist across our offerings. First, Mailchimp. We\'re rolling out 2 new GenAI experiences designed to help our customers grow their revenue and save time. These include AI-driven audience segmentation and marketing automation. I\'ll share more on those in just a moment. Second, TurboTax. As I shared earlier, during the extension season, we tested new GenAI experiences to deliver higher confidence for our DIY customers. This includes in-topic accuracy check and personalized explanations throughout the filing process that help explain a customer\'s tax outcome. We\'re excited about rolling out these experiences this season. Third, QuickBooks. We are testing GenAI to help customers save time and run their business with complete confidence, including a digital expert that can surface business insights and allow customers to dig deeper or connect them to a human expert. For example, we\'re serving up proactive business insights to customers with an actionable business summary. These customers are using the business summary as a launching point to learn, create reports directly using Intuit Assist and take actions to drive their business success. These experiences will be rolled out in the coming months and in the future, we plan to automate these actions and do the work for our customers. Fourth, Credit Karma. We\'re testing GenAI to help our customers find the products that are right for them in a highly personalized way. For example, based on our research, prime members spend an average of 5 hours online comparing credit card benefits. With our members\' credit data and spending history from accounts they choose to link to Credit Karma, we can use GenAI to help members select the right credit card for them optimized based on their personal spending history. This is designed to increase engagement with our members and help them improve their financial health and drive financial success.These experiences will be rolled out in the coming months. We are excited by Intuit Assist\'s early progress. It will change our relationship with customers as we move from a transactional workflow platform to a trusted assistant that our customers rely on daily to power their prosperity. We believe Intuit Assist will lead to higher frequency of engagement and monetization across the platform. Let me now highlight progress across 2 of our 5 Big Bets. As a reminder, our 5 Big Bets are revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. In payments, our innovation continues to drive digitization from creating an estimate to invoicing a customer to getting paid to paying a supplier. Today, easier discovery, auto-enable payments, instant deposit and get paid upfront are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering. Total online payment volume growth was strong in the quarter at 21%. We\'re also making good progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improving their cash flow. We made our bill pay offering widely available to customers during the quarter.While it\'s early, we are seeing mid-market customers choosing the paid subscription offering at approximately 2x the rate of non mid-market customers, indicating this paid offering is resonating with larger customers. Turning to Mailchimp. We are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. As I shared earlier, we\'re rolling out several features powered by Intuit Assist in time for peak holiday season for many of our customers. Let me highlight 2 of these impactful benefits designed to help our customers grow their revenue while saving time. First, AI-driven audience segmentation, which allows small businesses to target specific audiences. Many customers don\'t use audience segmentation today despite the fact that it can drive up to 60% lift in average order revenue or average order value over 12 months. With Intuit Assist, a customer can use conversational language to more quickly build segments and use them as a part of a marketing campaign.Second, AI-powered marketing automation, which are automated workflows that help small businesses reach their customers in uniquely tailored ways. Today, many of our customers don\'t use marketing automation because they are time consuming the setup even though they can help them drive higher revenue. With Intuit Assist, Mailchimp creates marketing automation, which can easily be turned on and e-mail content can be generated and edited. Our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market representing a TAM of 1.7 million customers, 800,000 of which are already in our franchise, but using a core QBO or desktop product. Online mid-market customer and revenue growth remained strong and we are driving increased adoption of QuickBooks Advanced, payments and payroll, resulting in ARPC expansion as we serve these mid-market customers with a full ecosystem of services. We are proud of our innovation and the impact that we\'re making on our customers\' lives. We also continue to make an impact on the communities that we serve. This quarter, we launched Intuit for Education, a new financial literacy program to provide GenZ and Gen Alpha students access to Intuit products and teach some personal and Small Business finance skills. We also announced the first set of winners of our Coalfield Solar Fund, providing grants to incentivize solar energy projects in coal mining communities to help build a sustainable future. Wrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy and focus on innovating with GenAI across our platform, we are more excited than ever about the opportunity in front of us and our ability to power prosperity for our customers. We are also delighted to be 1 of the only 8 Fortune 500 companies named to Fortune\'s inaugural top 50 AI Innovators list. With that, let me now hand it over to Sandeep.', 'Sandeep Singh Aujla', ""Thank you, Sasan. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we delivered very strong results that exceeded the high end of our guidance range across all key metrics, including revenue of $3 billion, up 15%. GAAP operating income of $307 million versus $76 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $960 million versus $662 million last year, up 45%. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.85 versus $0.14 a year ago. And non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.47 versus $1.66 last year, up 49%. I am pleased with our early momentum this fiscal year. Turning to the business segment. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 18% during the quarter, driven by Online Ecosystem, which grew 20%. Our results demonstrate the power of our Small Business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings, which continue to resonate with customers as they look to grow their businesses and improve cash flow in any economic environment. with the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, a strategic focus within a Small Business and Self-Employed group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 19% in Q1, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 20% in Q1, driven primarily by payroll, Mailchimp, payments, capital and time tracking. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting the payroll solutions and a mix shift towards higher-end offerings. In Mailchimp, revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paying customer growth. And within payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow as well as an increase in total payment volume per customer. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing a refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in established markets, and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on a localized product and lineup approach. On a constant currency basis, total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 16%. The Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 14% in the first quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the high single digits. We are more than 2/3 of the way through a 3-year transition for customers that remain on our license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model. In conjunction with our business model transition, we also raised prices across multiple desktop products this October, consistent with our principle to price for value. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong Desktop Ecosystem to revenue growth this year as we complete the remaining part of the 3-year transition.Our focus is to continue innovating across our Online Ecosystem and to help our desktop customers migrate seamlessly to our online offerings. We continue to expect the Online Ecosystem to be a growth catalyst longer term. Moving to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $405 million in Q1, down 5% year-over-year. We saw partners taking a conservative approach to extending credit in both personal loans and credit cards during Q1. This performance was consistent with our expectations and a prudent approach to guidance given the uncertain macroeconomic environment. On a product basis, the decline in Q1 was driven primarily by macroeconomic trends across personal loan, auto insurance, home loans and auto loans, partially offset by growth in credit cards and Credit Karma money. Shifting to the consumer and ProTax groups. Consumer Group revenue was $187 million and grew 25% in the quarter and ProTax revenue was $42 million and grew 24%. During the quarter, we saw stronger-than-expected TurboTax return volume from states, both with and without extended tax deadlines and strong performance in share of total returns during extension season. As Sasan shared earlier, we are excited about our innovation across TurboTax. The multiple experiments we ran during the extension season, bolster our confidence in our game plan to win this coming tax season. Now let me briefly touch on our financial principles and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions that remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and investments and $5.9 billion in debt on our balance sheet. In September, we raised $4 billion in secured -- sorry, in senior notes to repay the outstanding balance on an unsecured term loan. These notes carry a weighted average coupon of 5.29%, approximately 1 point lower than the term loan rate at the end of Q4.As a reminder, during Q1, we made tax payments of approximately $710 million that were deferred from fiscal 2023 due to the IRS disaster area tax relief. We also repurchased $603 million of stock during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors our aim is to be in the market each quarter. And lastly, the Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on January 18, 2024. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. As I stated earlier, I'm pleased with the early momentum we're seeing in fiscal 2024, highlighting the strength of our platform within the uncertain macroeconomic environment that is consistent with our expectations. We have a proven playbook and a track record of managing for the short and the long term, including controlling discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. Our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macroeconomic uncertainty in an even greater position of strength.Moving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2024 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 11% to 12%; GAAP operating income growth of 15% to 18%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 12% to 14%, GAAP earnings per share growth of 11% to 15% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 includes revenue growth of 11% to 12%. GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.68 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.25 to $2.31. As a reminder, we are taking a prudent approach with guidance given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. You can find our full fiscal 2024 and Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan."", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', 'All right. Well, thank you, Sandeep. And to wrap it up, we are confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and progress across our 5 Big Bets. And creating a future of ""done for you"" with a gateway to human expertise. We believe this will change our relationship with customers, becoming their trusted adviser, leading to higher engagement and monetization. The combination of our assets and our strategy creates a growth flywheel for Intuit to accelerate penetrating our $300 billion in town. With all of that said, let\'s now open it up to your questions.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.', 'Raimo Lenschow', ""Perfect. Sasan, on the AI strategy, like obviously, you have like 1 -- it seems like 1 big platform that is driving it. Like can you -- what's the kind of opportunity to kind of learn from 1 segment and use it in the other segment? And as part of that also, like are you impacted by the chip shortage? Will that kind of impact the rollout for you?"", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Yes. Thank you for your question. And I actually think it's a really interesting question that you're asking in terms of how are we learning across platforms.The short answer is we capture best practices and share the insights on a daily basis across our teams. And in fact, I'll just use our staff as an example. We get weekly slacks with documents that share the best practices, the progress that has been made and how that informs the next week across each of the platforms. And we spend 80% of my staff meeting actually doing product reviews of Intuit Assist. A big large part of it is what the key best practices are -- learnings are. And I would tell you that there's a lot of commonality in themes across our learnings across the platform, which actually is simply putting us in a position to accelerate our pivot and our progress and innovation and the timing of going GA across the platform.To your second question, no, we're not impacted by the chip shortage. It does not at all impact our launch plans."", 'Raimo Lenschow', 'Perfect. Congrats.', 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.', 'Keith Weiss', ""And congratulations on a really solid quarter. Two questions, one for Sasan and one for Sandeep and really digging into what I think were some of the bigger surprises in the quarter. Sasan, in this environment, I think we're surprised to see strength in a marketing platform like Mailchimp and you called that out as part of the strength in online services. Do you think that's more of an Intuit sort of independent factor of repackaging, marketing more aggressively distribution? Or is it the market is better than we expect? And then for Sandeep, operating margins were really strong in the quarter. Any onetime items or pull forward or expenses or push out of expenses that we should be mindful of in terms of why that type of operating margin performance isn't going to be reflected in the rest of the year?"", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Thanks for the question, Keith. I'll take your first one. What you're seeing from us in Mailchimp entirely execution. We're not getting tailwinds from the macro environment. And as I mentioned, when we closed the acquisition a while back that our biggest opportunity was to be clear about our product improvements, our lineup and to be able to create 1 growth platform, develop strength internationally and go to mid-market.And by the way, we've made a lot of progress in all of those areas. We still have a lot of work ahead of us, to be clear. But everything that you're seeing is based on our execution and no macro tailwinds."", 'Sandeep Singh Aujla', ""And on the margin question, Keith -- on the margin question, Keith, let me start by reiterating our commitment to having our expenses growth lower than revenue and in essence, delivering our margin expansion and operating leverage, which is something that we hold dearly and our guidance of 40 to 60 bps expansion for the year reflects that discipline that we have as a management team. On the margin for the quarter, I would share that, I won't get too fixated on the quarterly number. We had some expenses that moved out of the quarter into later parts of the year, including some marketing expenses. And as I shared during the prepared remarks, we are committed to our full year guidance on our operating income. So that's what I would guide you and the teams towards."", 'Keith Weiss', 'Excellent. Really nice job guys.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. .', 'Sitikantha Panigrahi', 'Sasan, I want to ask about the health of Small Business. Where do you see right now strength and weakness in this environment?', 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Thanks for the question, Siti. As you know, we've been in this macro environment for some time now. And the small businesses that we serve are resilient for a couple of reasons. One, they're on our platform. And by digitizing what they do, which is how they grow customers and managing their cash flow, they are far more resilient and -- and as we've shared before, anybody that's on our platform is nearly 20 points higher in their success rate than those that are not on our platform. So we are part of sort of the health that we're experiencing on our platform.With that as context, I would just share a couple of data points. One, the number of companies and the number of employees that our Small Business are hiring still remains strong. Two, our total online payments volume grew 21%, which means that our small businesses are continuing to be competitive and serving their consumers. I'll also remind us, by the way, I think, a year ago or more, that growth was in the 30% plus. And so we have seen an impact, but just our overall platform is very resilient. And then the last thing I would say is that the cash reserves of our small businesses is 90% of where it was this time last year. However, it's 128% of where it was pre-pandemic. So their cash flow is stronger than several years ago, but 10% down from last year.And then very specifically, as you know, we serve service-based businesses, which is about 70% of the market. We're not concentrated in any one particular area. But you'll see place things like auto repairs and that are doing well, professional services that are doing well. But just like pure construction, those that do lending not doing well. So there's sort of ups and downs across the small businesses that we see. But in aggregate, the health comes from the numbers that I shared with you."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.', 'Allan M. Verkhovski', 'Hi, this is Allan Verkhovski on behalf of Alex Zukin. QuickBooks Online accounting growth decelerated another 3 percentage points this quarter. With respect to your growth drivers, is there anything that got meaningfully worse in the quarter? Or something that is worth emphasizing to investors? And that would be helpful for thinking about what growth could look like for the rest of the year.', 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Yes. That was really driven by a larger price increase last year versus this year. That was really the only driver. We liked what we saw in terms of our acquisitions, our retention. So that's really the variance."", 'Allan M. Verkhovski', 'Okay. And as just a quick follow-up, would you be able to step through the monthly linearity that you saw in Credit Karma through the quarter and in November?', 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', 'Sorry, can you ask your question again?', 'Allan M. Verkhovski', 'Just on the Credit Karma thinking about the linearity of the business through the quarter in November. I was wondering if you could just kind of talk through on a monthly basis, what you saw in the underlying trends for Credit Karma.', 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Yes. Well, I'll answer your question in 2 ways. One, as you heard in our prepared remarks, we saw and we anticipated further tightening by our partners. By the way, it happened exactly the same time last year. And so we expected that as the -- our partners prepare for the end of the fiscal year and next year, there would be some further tightening, and that's really what we saw. And that was included in our expectations and in our guidance as we thought about the year. That's number one. Number two, there -- not everything is linear because it depends on the number of days like a month like November based on in the U.S. based on Thanksgiving week, the number of days that people take off that actually impacts certain behaviors. And so there is no linearity. But the quarter just in total was in line with what we expected."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Alex Markgraff with KeyBanc Capital Markets.', 'Alexander Wexler Markgraff', ""Yes, maybe just be curious to understand, Sasan, as you've done some of the testing around Intuit Assist across product categories. Has there been any sort of price testing involved in that as well? And how well received has that been if so?"", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Yes, sure. Let me answer your question in 2 ways because I think they're -- it's a great question, and it's connected. First of all, the biggest insight and learning that we have had is it's really important to have embedded benefits where the customer is doing the work versus sort of something on the side where the assistant is there to help the customer.So what I mean by that is while a customer is looking to build a marketing campaign right within the flow, we, in essence, help them with the audience they should segment, the audience they should target and then we will build their marketing campaign for them, but with them in complete control.So that's a really -- it may sound really obvious, but it's a really important learning, which, by the way, translates to also what we learned in tax, which is within the flow of helping a customer understand their money outcome, helping them understand and doing accuracy checks for them. And if they miss something, calling it out so they can address it right then and there. Those are examples that, by the way, is consistent across all of our platform workflows where embedded matters a lot.The second is depth, depending on the customer and what they're trying to do, there's a level of depth that they want to go to. So an example is within QuickBooks, one of the things that we've been testing and it's been testing really well is a business summary. And the business summary, in essence, provides what we believe are the most important things that, that customer should know and the customer that engages with those business insights and ultimately, will create reports or ask more questions.What we've learned is we're not building propensity models in terms of the timing of when to connect them to an expert. That's a monetizable event for us because if not, you can go on and on having a Q&A and ultimately not get to the benefit as quickly as possible.So those are major insights and learnings and those insights and learnings have led to how we're thinking about monetization. In the case of Mailchimp, having GenAI SKUs based on the things that we can do for customers automagically on their behalf. In the case of QuickBooks and by the way, TurboTax it's a monetizable event because it's a gateway to human expertise and expert help.And then we will be testing GenAI-specific SKUs also in QuickBooks. So those are illustrative examples based on the benefits that we're learning about what's important to customers, that then informs how we think about price testing. And so far, we're pleased with what we're learning and how fast we're pivoting as a company."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Steve Enders with Citi.', 'Steven Lester Enders', 'Okay. Great. I guess I want to ask on the tax business. What you saw this come on some of these newer product initiatives and maybe what kind of drove the strength there year-over-year and the share gains with some of those newer initiatives?', 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Yes, sure. Let me answer your question on 2 dimensions. One, there was a macro element, which there were just more filers in the extension season than we anticipated, both by the way, states that extended and states that did not extend. And these are more complex filers and it's actually our sweet spot. It's why we were able to take share in this extension season. And so that's one element of what drove our better-than-expected results.The 3 areas that we're excited about, these have been durable priorities where we did a lot of tests and experiments and got a lot of green shoots and learnings that will lead into this coming tax season, it's Credit Karma platform, it's TurboTax Live and its Intuit Assist. And I'll briefly touch on each of them. Within the Credit Karma platform, we have more seamlessly built out the tax experience, whether you want to do it yourself or you want somebody to do it for you. And we've been -- we've developed very compelling SKUs within the Credit Karma platform, which having the opportunity to serve 42 million monthly active users that engage 5 times a month was not only a great product, but a great set of SKUs. We saw green shoots and we're excited about that as we look at.The second is TurboTax Live. We expanded the scale of our data, AI and expert network. What that means is, and I'll just point out in 2 areas. One is the fact that for many customers that want to hand off all their taxes done, we can get their taxes done within an hour. And that's a very big deal to be able to engage an expert, have your data available and get your taxes done in 1 sitting and then also being able to serve business tax customers, which we'll be launching at scale. Those were areas of green shoots. And the last is Intuit Assist. Two big areas. One is accuracy checks and making sure that in place, we help the customer, in essence, correct something that we believe is a mistake. That's a big conversion driver, by the way. And then the second is just explaining refunds, explaining their money outcome, which is all done and driven by Intuit Assist leveraging our knowledge engineering capabilities and our GenAI capabilities.So those are the 3 things along with the macro where we saw green shoots that give us a lot of confidence as we head into season."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Brent Thill with Jefferies. .', 'Sang-Jin Byun', ""This is John Byun for Brent. First question on Mailchimp. Wondering if you could share some color on how it's doing in U.S. versus international. And I don't know if you could talk about also about the cross-selling synergies with the rest of the Small Business platform. And second, any update on how the native bill pay is ramping?"", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', 'What was your last question, bill pay?', 'Sang-Jin Byun', 'Yes. On bill pay.', 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Yes. Got it. Thanks for the question. So I'll start with Mailchimp. As we talked about, one of our top priorities includes international. We've spent quite a bit of time and investment in translating to local languages building out a team that can focus on EMEA. And third, making sure that we've got the right pricing lineup and go-to-market plan. And we're executing against that. We like what we see. and it's contributing to the numbers that we reported.And I would say, for us, it's the balance of focus between U.S. and international. We see an enormous opportunity in U.S. and in international. So we have the right balance focus as we think about the geographies. The second, in terms of cross-sell as we shared at Investor Day, we are a big part of the thesis behind the acquisition was to create 1 growth platform. And what we shared at Investor Day was that we are building an AI native CRM within the QuickBooks platform. We're continuing to make progress in testing and learning and pivoting to get the product market fit. When we get the product market fit. That's really where the cross-sell takes place. We've not assumed or anticipated any contribution from that in our guidance this year. But it's a very important long-term strategic priority. It's the reason why we acquired the platform is to ultimately have 1 growth platform where you can grow your customers and manage our cash flow all in one place. So that's on the Mailchimp front.On bill pay, we're pleased with the fact that we're GA and we -- and as I think noted earlier, what we're seeing with our mid-market customers is -- mid-market versus non mid-market customers, there's a 2x increase in those that are taking the subscription, the paid subscription. So that just means that we're adding value.We also have work ahead of us in bill pay, things around batch payments, faster funding, all the things that we know we have to have. It's on our roadmap, and it will be launched in the future. So along with the fact that we're GA, we're clear on what the gaps are and what -- and it's on our roadmap, we're working feverishly to really be able to digitize B2B for our customers because we believe it's a big opportunity for our customers to improve their cash flow and a big growth opportunity for us in the long term. So that's the progress on both fronts."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel.', 'Brad Robert Reback', ""Sasan, as you think about the mid-market opportunity for the QuickBooks and the Online Ecosystem, given the value prop, is it easier to take share during difficult economic times because of that value prop? Or are customers just hesitant to move and wait for the economy to get better before they'll make a back-office switch?"", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', 'Yes, great question. I\'ll share 2 different perspectives in terms of what we\'re seeing.The first one is, it really doesn\'t matter what the economic environment is. If it\'s great, they don\'t behave differently if it\'s challenging like it is now, they don\'t behave differently. We certainly don\'t see them -- any of our customers wanting not to switch because the economy is not good, which leads to the second point I wanted to make.So the headline on the first question is, it\'s not a tailwind or a headwind, whether it\'s good times or bad times. However, what I would say is we see some green shoots that\'s early when we do bundling for our customers. When we go to our customers and share with them that they can digitize all of their payments, all of their payroll and the benefits that it will have for our customers from a cash flow perspective, we see that having traction with our customers.And as we\'ve continued to build out our sales team, we\'re doing, I think, a far better job of account management. And this is an area where if you look back 5 years ago, we didn\'t have the kind of value-added account management teams that we\'re building now where we\'re engaging our customers, are hearing from us, right? We\'ve been entirely a self-solve platform. And now that we\'re engaging our customers, a lot of them are starting to realize, ""Oh, wow, you have payments, Oh, I didn\'t realize you have payroll. I didn\'t you have time tracking. I didn\'t realize your own Mailchimp.""And that is an opportunity for us to drive an increased penetration in wallet share. So I share that just to say that\'s where we\'re getting traction. That\'s where we\'re seeing progress, and that\'s where we see an opportunity as we look ahead.', 'Sandeep Singh Aujla', ""And Brad, what I would add is beyond just the QuickBooks side. We also are seeing strong progress on the Mailchimp side in terms of mid-market where historically before we acquired the company was not a focus. And now with some of the stuff was Sasan mentioned, including account management, better onboarding, we're seeing better customer acquisition on the mid-market as well as better retention year-over-year in the mid-market, so that opportunity extends beyond just the QuickBooks for us across the entire platform, including Mailchimp."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.', 'Kirk Materne', ""Congrats on the quarter. Sasan, I was wondering if you could just talk about the -- I realize you have a vast and sort of wide open TAM in your markets on the Small Business side. But I was kind of curious if you're seeing any evidence that Small Businesses are looking to consolidate multiple technologies onto 1 platform. You all obviously offer a lot both on the front office is an as well in the back office. Are you starting to see any of that sort of activity happening now that you're sort of integrating Mailchimp with QuickBooks? I realize it's early days, and you need that to happen to be successful. But I was just wondering if you're seeing any evidence of that yet?"", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Yes, Kirk, the short answer is, it's early, but we're seeing green shoots, and it's primarily because of what I shared just a moment ago, as we're building out our account management team across Mailchimp and QuickBooks platform, as we're talking to our customers, and in fact, I personally spoke to 3 of them in the last month that are very large mid-market customers, 2 of them in L.A. and one of them in Miami. And it actually starts with -- they didn't know even know we have, payments, payroll. They didn't even know we're the same company that owns Mailchimp as an example. Some of them will use Mailchimp but they'll use QuickBooks. Some of them use our payroll, but don't use our payments and so the thing that we're inspired by and where we believe there's a big opportunity is the fact that we actually have a huge differentiation, which is around data, AI and network of experts and an ecosystem of applications. And the applications are all the things that a Small Business would want. And our account management team is really discovering for us the fact that our customers just don't know. And so therefore, we engage them, build relationships and talk about the benefits of all of our applications and then what could be done based on all of the capabilities that we have around AI and how that could fuel their success. That's what's really opening up doors for us is just the unknown. And that's what we're excited about as we continue to accelerate building out our accounts management team. So I think the long answer to your short question is, yes, customers would prefer to be on 1 platform. And what we're learning is a lot of customers are not -- because they just actually don't even know what we do holistically, and that's the mission that we are on."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.', 'Arti Vula', ""This is Arti Vula on for Mark Murphy. Congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to touch on QuickBooks Advance. You mentioned at your Investor Day. that the success of that product is more about just the go-to-market versus kind of a new product or feature development. So can you kind of discuss progress from your perspective on that front?And then in terms of the mid-market -- is that -- can you talk about how that's faring in terms of overall health? And maybe compare that to the lower end of the market?"", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', 'Yes, sure. Thank you for your question. First of all, just to play back what I shared at the Investor Day, I said if I had to pick one that was the most important lever going forward, it\'s go-to-market. We are continuing feverishly to build out the product capabilities that we need on the platform because we don\'t plan to stop at 100 employees. Our plan is to serve mid-market customers over time that are far larger than 100.However, in the near term, sort of near and midterm, the biggest needle mover is go-to-market. And I would tell you that it continues to be bringing on the right skill sets of talent in sales and marketing. And so even in the last, I think, couple of quarters, it\'s been -- we\'ve hired a very strong marketing leader. We\'re -- we\'ve hired a very strong sales leader. We\'re hiring a couple of more sales leaders. We\'re bringing on account managers that have a lot of skill in selling and nurturing customers.Because when we think about mid-market, it\'s really about -- a lot of the examples I was using earlier, which is really helping customers understand they can run their business in 1 place on 1 platform and the benefits of doing so and what it will mean to their cash flow and particularly helping them understand our road map as a company and what we are doing with Intuit Assist, which is really creating a feature of ""done for you"" with always having a gateway to human expertise. And that\'s enticing for mid-market customers. So net-net, that\'s the way I would describe our focus area. But we\'d want your walk away to be we\'re continuing to invest in the product and in the platform because that\'s a big opportunity in the long term as well. In terms of health, I think it really -- it comes down to the sector, if you just use U.S. as an example, comes down to the state, the sector that you\'re in. Generally speaking, based on our history looking backwards, larger, more tenured customers can withstand more of economic turmoil versus someone that literally just started out their business and they only have $100,000 in their savings and a $100,000 dispense, then they\'re done, right, they go bankrupt. So it really depends on the size of the business, how long that they\'ve been in business and then the segment that their business is in, all those variables play in. I wouldn\'t say younger ones are more or less healthy and the older ones are healthier. I would just say it depends on the components that I just described a moment ago.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.', 'Kartik Mehta', ""Sasan, maybe we've talked a lot about the Full Service business. And as you look at that business and all the learnings you've talked about, how will you define success for that business at the end of the tax season? Is it the number of returns of process? Is it -- I guess, what are the metrics that you will use to figure if you had success or not? ."", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Yes. Thanks for your question. First of all, I'll start with something that's really, really important, and that is the investments that we've made over the years where TurboTax is now 1 platform, and that platform is built on an incredible rich sort of data layer AI layer and expert network. And now an ecosystem of apps, which is consumer app and business taxes.And the reason I start there is because now we have the ability in 1 place for you to do your taxes yourself, get help with an expert that's matched specifically to your needs and we can do your taxes for you. And in fact, you can request the same person to do your taxes for you year in and year out and provide advice along the way. The reason I started with that foundational element that we are 1 platform as we go to market and start talking to customers about the notion of that choice with us, and we can do everything for you. it actually creates a halo effect. And so what we will look at are metrics around number of customers, conversion, retention, ARPC across the entire franchise. And we also look at it by area. So very specifically, Full Service plays a very important halo effect because it's an element of confidence. It's actually knowing that if I want to hand everything off to someone that Intuit can now do it for me, whether it's virtually or now locally, if I want to connect to an expert, but ultimately, the metric that will matter the most for Full Service is going to be ARPC because it's not just the numbers game. It's the value of these customers. We, of course, will measure a number of customers and ARPC, but ARPC will have the largest impact to our outcomes this year and in the future because now we do your taxes for you as a consumer and as a business."", 'Kartik Mehta', ""Perfect. And Sandeep just one quick question. You talked about not wanting to focus on 1 quarter for margins. But I'm wondering, as you look at the year, any differentiation or movement in marketing especially as the tax season unfolds?"", 'Sandeep Singh Aujla', ""Kartik, we are continuing to invest across our product, across the Big Bet, across GenAI, across marketing and particularly as we go to Full Service, we want to make sure that we are expanding our brand's equity beyond the DIY category to the Full Service. But I would not expect any meaningful shift in the seasonality of our marketing spend, which I think is the question that you're asking. So -- And I feel pretty good about the campaigns and the investments we've been making across the go-to-market motions across tax as well as the other segments."", 'Kartik Mehta', 'Yes. That was the question I was asking. I just did a poor job of it.', 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Brad Sills with Bank of America.', 'Bradley Hartwell Sills', ""Another question here on TurboTax as you're kind of heading into the next tax season here. Now that the focus is more on Full Service and TurboTax Live, is there something different about the end user, the end consumer filer that you're targeting now, say, going after that CPA segment that's different from traditionally, where you've gone after that tax store, you've had tremendous success there against tax stores. Now that CPA segment. Is there some difference there? And is there some learning from last year in go-to-market that you can apply this year to gain more traction there in that end of the market."", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Yes, Brad, thank you for your question. And it's actually spot on the way you asked it, and that is we view our opportunity as nearly 100 million customers that are either consumers, which is about 88 million of the 100 million and the rest are our business customers, small businesses. We view our opportunity going after them, which is a combination of small pros, mom-and-pop shops, stores is actually a smaller part of the whole pie. And in the last, I would say, 18 months, we've experimented a lot with how do we go after these customers, how do we raise awareness, how do we get them to consider and ultimately, how do we ensure that when they come to our front door, front door is a service front door not a software front door because of the behaviors that they have. And a lot of those both go-to-market and platform insights and learnings is what has informed a number of things that I touched on earlier that we experimented with and ran test in the tax extension season and what we feel good about going into this coming season.So it was a long answer to your question, but yes, a lot of those insights have informed our game plan because we're not just the software platform, we're a software and service platform, given who we're focused on serving. And by the way, while I have the floor, the same thing applies to small businesses as we think about what we're doing to embed QuickBooks Live in our offering."", 'Operator', 'Our last question will come from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.', 'Scott Andrew Schneeberger', ""I have a follow-up for Sandeep and then one for you, Sasan. Sandeep, on the margins in the quarter, you cited marketing, which I assume was predominantly that. Was there anything else in the quarter that was beneficial? Or was that the lion's share? And then you mentioned spread over the balance of the year and (inaudible) I felt you kind of were speaking to TurboTax but it looks like you're expecting a bit of a down quarter on margin in the second quarter. So will -- and it seemed like it was mostly in Small Business. the real benefit in the first quarter. So will that end as of second quarter? Is that truly something that is going to tail off in the second half as well? And then I'll come back to the follow-up."", 'Sandeep Singh Aujla', ""Sure. Thanks for the question, Scott. The way I would think about the Q1, we had multiple expenses that moved out of the quarter into later parts of the year, and marketing was one of those expense lines, and I would not say that marketing was the lion's share of it. There were several things that we expected will hit us in October that got pushed out, but I would definitely not take away as marketing being the lion's share of items that got pushed out.And you're right, some of those will get caught up, and we'll have those expenses in Q2 and so once you look at Q1 and Q2 spent together, those things will start normalizing out. Again, I'll bring you and the team back to the fact that you should all be focusing on our margins on a full year basis. In any given year, we could have different expense trend lines. So again, we remain confident in our guidance for the full year across the margins for the company."", 'Scott Andrew Schneeberger', ""Appreciate that. And Sasan, we're pretty well along now into Karma Guarantee. Would love just to get an update on that and Credit Karma was a bit stronger than we had anticipated in the quarter. Is it something that could potentially inflect a positive year-over-year growth in the fiscal first half? Or is that something that you'd expect more in the back half."", 'Sasan K. Goodarzi', ""Yes. Thank you for your question. First of all, I'll start with, based on our insights and learnings from last year, we really took an approach to be intentional and prudent about the guidance that we provide, which means taking into account not only a macro environment, but also not just banking, a bunch of initiatives in the back half of the year.We're aggressive in the initiatives that we're working on, but we did not bake them into our guidance because we just wanted to be thoughtful and prudent. With that as context, I would -- I love your question about Karma Guarantee because we haven't explicitly been talking about it and it's not because it's not important anymore. It's because of the way we are now thinking about it and incorporating it into several areas. One is you've heard us talk about the entire app redesign, which is far more focused on putting the right benefits in front of the customers at the right time, which we talked about at Investor Day, that coupled with Intuit Assist. And the example I used in -- earlier was the fact that prime customers spend literally 4 or 5 hours doing comparison shopping between credit cards because they can get whatever credit card they want, but they're looking for the perks. Now we can automatically do that for them based on all of the data and everything that we know about them. So you combine the app redesign with Intuit Assist and our focus on prime customers. Karma Guarantee plays an important role helping customers, particularly those that have a hard time getting access to financial products, guarantee them that if they choose what's in front of them that they're going to be approved for it or we'll put $50 in their bank account. So the combination of those things is what the set of initiatives are that we are focused on that we expect will drive engagement, higher frequency and monetization. And we've not included that in our guidance, but it's very important for the future growth of the business.Not only that, and I'll end with this, tax is an enormous part of it. We've now spent several years thinking about how does every interaction and move a customer makes in the Credit Karma platform? How does that inform what that will mean to their taxes. So that when it's tax time, it's a much more seamless experience along with compelling offers. So taxes now, as we look ahead, such an important part of the life of the member and our focus area within Credit Karma. And all of those combined is what we have high hopes for in the future. Again, not in our guidance but important for the future."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, there are no -- go ahead, sir.', 'Sasan K.

If you want to skip our overview of seasonal investing and some recent stock market news, then take a look at 5 Best Seasonal Stocks To Buy Now. ', 'Seasonality and cyclicality are unavoidable parts of the climate, the economy, and business operations. Just like summers and winters regularly take place each year, an economy undergoes periods of economic growth and economic contraction. Similarly, businesses are often limited to selling their products in certain months, and this ends up affecting their supply chain as well.', ""One of the strongest examples of seasonal revenue is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple's fiscal year ends in September, and the month is also central to the firm's business cycle. Apple regularly upgrades its iPhone in September, and October marks the start of its first quarter. Naturally, sales of the iPhone are highest when the smartphone is launched, and Apple's revenue is the highest during Q1 as well. This cyclical nature also translates downstream into Apple's supply chain in the form of orders made to build the iPhone."", ""Before Apple's first fiscal quarter, orders made to companies such as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) pick up during the quarter ending in September and they slow down during a year's first calendar quarter after the U.S. technology giant has finished making most of the orders for its latest products. Looking at the firm's latest revenue figures. its first quarter of fiscal year 2023 revenue stood at $117 billion and went on to drop to $94 billion, $81 billion, and $89 billion during the succeeding quarters, respectively."", ""The next question to ask after keeping this seasonality in mind is if it affects stock performance. After all, if some quarters consistently see higher revenues, then one might also imagine that the stock price gains more during these time periods. Well, data compiled by the analytics platform Tradewell shows that October is the best month to buy Apple's shares as they historically return 5.35% on average. For a three month period, the months between November and February see the stock post the most returns, sitting at 8.67%. Likewise, the three months between May and August are the worst months for the shares. Comparing these figures with the nature of Apple's business shows that the business cycle does appear to create short term opportunities for stock market profit taking."", ""Similar perturbations are also present in the economy as we alluded to above. These come in the form of cyclicality, a data pattern that is similar to seasonality. The difference between seasonality and cyclicality is that seasonal patterns follow a set time period (like the summer months or Apple's quarterly revenue) while cyclical patterns are not time constrained. What this means is that an economy can show peak growth and peak drops over any time period, whether it's one month or one year - with the only certainty being that these extreme highs and lows will take place."", 'Coming back to the stock market, seasonality is one of the most favorite topics in academia, with researchers consistently studying any factor that could influence share price returns. One such research paper comes from the Ivey Business School of the University of Western Ontario. It analyzed value and growth stock performance of equities listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX (now NYSE American) stock exchanges to discover that not only is seasonality present across returns generated by both value and growth stocks, but also that they exhibit different seasonal patterns.', 'The researchers concluded:', 'The paper finds that both value and growth stocks exhibit seasonal strength in January and the first half of the year, but the effect is stronger for the value stocks. In the second half of the year, however, the opposite is true. Growth stocks exhibit weaker performance than value stocks. Seasonality is also observed in the value premium, which exhibits peak seasonal strength in the June to July period for NASDAQ and NYSE and relative seasonal weakness in the remaining months of the year. AMEX stocks, on the other hand, exhibit seasonal strength in the first seven months of the year and seasonal weakness thereafter, with AMEX value premium turning negative, which is unlike the NYSE and NASDAQ value premiums that always remain positive. While the findings are, in general, consistent with the January seasonal strength of value stocks found by Loughran (1997), there is no evidence that NASDAQ stocks drive the results. The findings, which are pervasive across all markets examined, are consistent with the gamesmanship hypothesis and portfolio rebalancing by professional portfolio managers. However, they are not consistent with the argument that it may be higher risk that drives the outperformance of value stocks. This is because while portfolio managers seem to rebalance aggressively into value stocks at the beginning of the year, they switch out of growth stocks more aggressively in the second half of the year (which they would not do if growth stocks had lower risk than value stocks), thus negating the argument that value stocks bear more risk that growth stocks.', ""Today, we'll look at some seasonal stocks and the top picks are Amazon.com, Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to\xa05 Countries With Better Healthcare Than The United States.', 'One of the biggest challenges faced by the global healthcare system is inflation. The trend of rising healthcare costs is especially significant in the United States. According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, from 2000 to June 2023, the prices of all goods and services increased by 80.8% in the US. During the same period, the costs of healthcare services increased by 114.3%.', 'The pandemic has also been a main factor in the hike in healthcare spending. Despite moving towards the endemic stage, COVID accounts for a significant amount of overall expenditure. On January 9, McKinsey published an article\xa0estimating that $200 billion annually will be added to the United States healthcare spending for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.', 'Another main issue is the high prices of healthcare services. In 2020, the US spent almost 20% of their GDP on healthcare. Despite spending more than almost all other countries, the US healthcare system is still devoid of outcomes. According to an article\xa0by the Peterson Centre on Healthcare, life expectancy in the US has dropped by 2.4 years from 2019 to 2021, whereas in other OECD countries, it was 0.3 years during the same period. The high costs limit the delivery of desired results despite the input of huge sums of money.', 'In February 2022, CNBC published an\xa0interview in which Cynthia Cox, Vice President of Kaiser Family Foundation, highlighted this issue in the US healthcare system. Here is what she said:', '""People in the US use a similar amount of healthcare to people in other wealthy and large countries, but we pay more for each interaction. The money in hospitals and doctors is what makes up the big difference between what we spend on healthcare in the US and what other countries spend. When we talk about ways to reduce spending, you can either look at ways to reduce the amount of care that people are getting or to reduce the price that people are paying for their care. In the US, it seems that there needs to be more of a focus on the prices of care because that\'s where the real difference is between what we spend in the US and what other people spend in other countries.""', 'According to BLS, in 2022, physicians and hospitals made up 47% of the total healthcare cost in the United States. The higher costs result in people delaying seeking medical care or getting preventative checkups. As a result, this delay further adds costs as the price of prevention is lower than the expense of curing the disease. The resulting cure-centric healthcare system is one of the biggest challenges in the US.

If you want to skip our introduction to the mineral industry and some recent news, then take a look at the 5 Best Mineral Stocks To Buy Now. ', ""While money makes the world go around, the same can also be said of minerals. After all, the global economy is built on humanity's reliance on steel - which is made from a mineral. Then, silica, which is the backbone of the technology industry through its use in making semiconductors is also a mineral. As if this weren't enough, copper and lithium which are indispensable to humanity's fight to reduce global emissions, are also minerals."", 'This makes it clear that minerals go hand in hand with the economic prosperity of today and tomorrow. Naturally, the minerals and mining industry is also one of the biggest in the world when it comes to market value. For instance, data from The Business Research Company shows that the global mining market was worth $2.02 trillion in 2022 and it is slated to grow to sit at $2.1 trillion by the end of this year after growing through a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.1%. Then, the growth rate is expected to accelerate, as the research firm estimates that until 2027, the mining industry will have a 6.7% CAGR and a final value of $2.78 trillion.', ""Within the mineral industry, there are several different kinds of products that are produced. Minerals are generally defined as naturally occurring solid materials with defined atomic structures, which means that they cover nearly every metal known to humanity. This broad definition also means that the mineral industry is quite diverse with several different use cases, such as those we've mentioned above."", ""Delving deeper, while minerals are essential for the world's normal functioning today as well as future initiatives, capital expenditure within the mining sector varies with fluctuations within the commodities market. When prices are high, firms are encouraged to spend more to beef up their production, and when prices fall, they cut down on investments. Data from McKinsey shows that global capital expenditures in mining were cut in half from $260 billion in 2012 to $130 billion in 2020. This is concerning since progression with renewable and alternative energy sources is dependent on vibrant and robust investments in global mining capabilities. McKinsey adds that from 2016, the dollar value of mining capital expenditures started to grow but their percentage with respect to operational cash flows still remained low."", ""Shifting gears to narrow down our focus on mineral companies, one of the most important companies right now is Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB). Albemarle is crucial to the minerals industry since it is one of the biggest suppliers of lithium in the world. Lithium, if you're unaware, is crucial for the electric vehicle industry, and Albemarle is known for its crucial relationship with car companies including the electric vehicle giant Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, while everyone agrees that the long term prospects of lithium are quite strong due to its use in batteries, 2023 has been a rather surprising year for the industry. This is because lithium prices have considerably dropped this year, and as we mentioned above when prices drop, capital expenditures are also often reduced. You can also read 10 Most Profitable Lithium Stocks Now for more details about lithium stocks."", 'The scale of the 2023 lithium price crash is not widely reported either. As an example, consider the average price of battery grade lithium carbonate in China. This stood at $84,500 per metric ton in November 2022, but a year later, has dropped by a rather stunning 78% to sit at $18,630 as of late November 2023. At the heart of this drop is the current global investment and economic climate, as high interest rates have also put the brakes on global electric vehicle demand and high inflation coupled with labor market uncertainty has limited the amount of money that people can fork out themselves for pricey car purchases.', 'At the same time, mining and minerals firms are also speeding up their investments in environmentally friendly technologies to reduce the impact of their operations on their surroundings. For instance, one of the biggest mining companies in the world, the British giant Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), is currently investigating the use of a bio-friendly material to replace the reliance on dirty coking coal for producing a titanium ore used to make plastics, inks, and fabrics.', ""Today, we'll take a look at some top mineral stocks to buy with the notable picks being Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

If you want to skip our overview of seasonal investing and some recent stock market news, then take a look at 5 Best Seasonal Stocks To Buy Now. ', 'Seasonality and cyclicality are unavoidable parts of the climate, the economy, and business operations. Just like summers and winters regularly take place each year, an economy undergoes periods of economic growth and economic contraction. Similarly, businesses are often limited to selling their products in certain months, and this ends up affecting their supply chain as well.', ""One of the strongest examples of seasonal revenue is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple's fiscal year ends in September, and the month is also central to the firm's business cycle. Apple regularly upgrades its iPhone in September, and October marks the start of its first quarter. Naturally, sales of the iPhone are highest when the smartphone is launched, and Apple's revenue is the highest during Q1 as well. This cyclical nature also translates downstream into Apple's supply chain in the form of orders made to build the iPhone."", ""Before Apple's first fiscal quarter, orders made to companies such as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) pick up during the quarter ending in September and they slow down during a year's first calendar quarter after the U.S. technology giant has finished making most of the orders for its latest products. Looking at the firm's latest revenue figures. its first quarter of fiscal year 2023 revenue stood at $117 billion and went on to drop to $94 billion, $81 billion, and $89 billion during the succeeding quarters, respectively."", ""The next question to ask after keeping this seasonality in mind is if it affects stock performance. After all, if some quarters consistently see higher revenues, then one might also imagine that the stock price gains more during these time periods. Well, data compiled by the analytics platform Tradewell shows that October is the best month to buy Apple's shares as they historically return 5.35% on average. For a three month period, the months between November and February see the stock post the most returns, sitting at 8.67%. Likewise, the three months between May and August are the worst months for the shares. Comparing these figures with the nature of Apple's business shows that the business cycle does appear to create short term opportunities for stock market profit taking."", ""Similar perturbations are also present in the economy as we alluded to above. These come in the form of cyclicality, a data pattern that is similar to seasonality. The difference between seasonality and cyclicality is that seasonal patterns follow a set time period (like the summer months or Apple's quarterly revenue) while cyclical patterns are not time constrained. What this means is that an economy can show peak growth and peak drops over any time period, whether it's one month or one year - with the only certainty being that these extreme highs and lows will take place."", 'Coming back to the stock market, seasonality is one of the most favorite topics in academia, with researchers consistently studying any factor that could influence share price returns. One such research paper comes from the Ivey Business School of the University of Western Ontario. It analyzed value and growth stock performance of equities listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX (now NYSE American) stock exchanges to discover that not only is seasonality present across returns generated by both value and growth stocks, but also that they exhibit different seasonal patterns.', 'The researchers concluded:', 'The paper finds that both value and growth stocks exhibit seasonal strength in January and the first half of the year, but the effect is stronger for the value stocks. In the second half of the year, however, the opposite is true. Growth stocks exhibit weaker performance than value stocks. Seasonality is also observed in the value premium, which exhibits peak seasonal strength in the June to July period for NASDAQ and NYSE and relative seasonal weakness in the remaining months of the year. AMEX stocks, on the other hand, exhibit seasonal strength in the first seven months of the year and seasonal weakness thereafter, with AMEX value premium turning negative, which is unlike the NYSE and NASDAQ value premiums that always remain positive. While the findings are, in general, consistent with the January seasonal strength of value stocks found by Loughran (1997), there is no evidence that NASDAQ stocks drive the results. The findings, which are pervasive across all markets examined, are consistent with the gamesmanship hypothesis and portfolio rebalancing by professional portfolio managers. However, they are not consistent with the argument that it may be higher risk that drives the outperformance of value stocks. This is because while portfolio managers seem to rebalance aggressively into value stocks at the beginning of the year, they switch out of growth stocks more aggressively in the second half of the year (which they would not do if growth stocks had lower risk than value stocks), thus negating the argument that value stocks bear more risk that growth stocks.', ""Today, we'll look at some seasonal stocks and the top picks are Amazon.com, Inc.

If you want to skip our overview of seasonal investing and some recent stock market news, then take a look at 5 Best Seasonal Stocks To Buy Now. ', 'Seasonality and cyclicality are unavoidable parts of the climate, the economy, and business operations. Just like summers and winters regularly take place each year, an economy undergoes periods of economic growth and economic contraction. Similarly, businesses are often limited to selling their products in certain months, and this ends up affecting their supply chain as well.', ""One of the strongest examples of seasonal revenue is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple's fiscal year ends in September, and the month is also central to the firm's business cycle. Apple regularly upgrades its iPhone in September, and October marks the start of its first quarter. Naturally, sales of the iPhone are highest when the smartphone is launched, and Apple's revenue is the highest during Q1 as well. This cyclical nature also translates downstream into Apple's supply chain in the form of orders made to build the iPhone."", ""Before Apple's first fiscal quarter, orders made to companies such as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) pick up during the quarter ending in September and they slow down during a year's first calendar quarter after the U.S. technology giant has finished making most of the orders for its latest products. Looking at the firm's latest revenue figures. its first quarter of fiscal year 2023 revenue stood at $117 billion and went on to drop to $94 billion, $81 billion, and $89 billion during the succeeding quarters, respectively."", ""The next question to ask after keeping this seasonality in mind is if it affects stock performance. After all, if some quarters consistently see higher revenues, then one might also imagine that the stock price gains more during these time periods. Well, data compiled by the analytics platform Tradewell shows that October is the best month to buy Apple's shares as they historically return 5.35% on average. For a three month period, the months between November and February see the stock post the most returns, sitting at 8.67%. Likewise, the three months between May and August are the worst months for the shares. Comparing these figures with the nature of Apple's business shows that the business cycle does appear to create short term opportunities for stock market profit taking."", ""Similar perturbations are also present in the economy as we alluded to above. These come in the form of cyclicality, a data pattern that is similar to seasonality. The difference between seasonality and cyclicality is that seasonal patterns follow a set time period (like the summer months or Apple's quarterly revenue) while cyclical patterns are not time constrained. What this means is that an economy can show peak growth and peak drops over any time period, whether it's one month or one year - with the only certainty being that these extreme highs and lows will take place."", 'Coming back to the stock market, seasonality is one of the most favorite topics in academia, with researchers consistently studying any factor that could influence share price returns. One such research paper comes from the Ivey Business School of the University of Western Ontario. It analyzed value and growth stock performance of equities listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX (now NYSE American) stock exchanges to discover that not only is seasonality present across returns generated by both value and growth stocks, but also that they exhibit different seasonal patterns.', 'The researchers concluded:', 'The paper finds that both value and growth stocks exhibit seasonal strength in January and the first half of the year, but the effect is stronger for the value stocks. In the second half of the year, however, the opposite is true. Growth stocks exhibit weaker performance than value stocks. Seasonality is also observed in the value premium, which exhibits peak seasonal strength in the June to July period for NASDAQ and NYSE and relative seasonal weakness in the remaining months of the year. AMEX stocks, on the other hand, exhibit seasonal strength in the first seven months of the year and seasonal weakness thereafter, with AMEX value premium turning negative, which is unlike the NYSE and NASDAQ value premiums that always remain positive. While the findings are, in general, consistent with the January seasonal strength of value stocks found by Loughran (1997), there is no evidence that NASDAQ stocks drive the results. The findings, which are pervasive across all markets examined, are consistent with the gamesmanship hypothesis and portfolio rebalancing by professional portfolio managers. However, they are not consistent with the argument that it may be higher risk that drives the outperformance of value stocks. This is because while portfolio managers seem to rebalance aggressively into value stocks at the beginning of the year, they switch out of growth stocks more aggressively in the second half of the year (which they would not do if growth stocks had lower risk than value stocks), thus negating the argument that value stocks bear more risk that growth stocks.', ""Today, we'll look at some seasonal stocks and the top picks are Amazon.com, Inc.

In October, the Commerce Department revealed that the country's GDP expanded by 4.9% over the third quarter. This growth rate marked the strongest quarterly increase in GDP in almost two years, reflecting a significant acceleration in economic activity within that period. However, some analysts are concerned that things might slow down. Chris Senyek, the chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, mentioned that this year, the economy did better than expected but looking ahead, both his team and other experts predict a slowdown in the coming months for the U.S. economy."", ""Dividend stocks have become a cornerstone for many investors due to their unique appeal in generating consistent income. This consistent stream of cash is a big draw for investors who appreciate getting a slice of the company's earnings on top of any potential growth in the stock's value. It's like having a steady paycheck while also having the opportunity for your investment to increase in worth. Income-focused strategies have encountered significant challenges throughout this year. Factors such as market volatility, economic shifts, or changes in investment landscapes might have made it harder for these strategies to deliver the anticipated levels of income or profits. In the third quarter, the total global dividends dropped by 0.9%, totaling $421.9 billion, as reported in the most recent Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index. In addition to this, The ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF, which represents a collection of stocks known for consistent dividend payments, has experienced a 0.82% return this year so far, factoring in the dividends earned. That stands in stark contrast to the 19.5% return seen in the broader market."", 'That said, dividends continue to show promise as we head into 2024, provided investors adopt the right strategies.

Here are some comments from the firm from its recent\xa0 research note:', '“As the U.S. economy slows, we expect more defensive strategies to outperform the broader market. During economic slowdowns or recessionary environments, our favorite dividend-focused strategy is buying companies with a long record of consistently increasing dividends.”', ""Some of the best dividend stocks that have consistently raised their dividend include The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

It's a popular way to get dividends by buying a stock right before the company pays out its dividend and then selling it shortly after. People are into this strategy because they aim to grab that dividend payment without holding onto the stock for a long time. It's like a quick way to catch those dividends as they come and then move on to the next opportunity.

While insider selling is not uncommon, the size of the transaction and the absence of insider buying over the past year could be seen as a cautious signal.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the implications of an aging population on the economy, the global longevity economy, and workplaces that embrace older employees, and go directly to 5 Countries with the Oldest Populations in the World.\xa0', 'For almost all of human history, the Earth’s population has skewed younger. But a major shift has occurred since 2018, and for the first time ever, there are more people on our planet over the age of 65 than there are children under the age of 5. This aging is the result of a continued decline in fertility rates and increased life expectancy. Consequently, compared to 2017, the number of persons aged 60 or above is expected to more than double by 2050 and more than triple by 2100, rising from 962 million globally in 2017, to 2.1 billion in 2050, and 3.1 billion by 2100.\xa0', 'Though a longer life span, particularly a healthy one, is viewed as an enormous gain for human welfare, it comes with its own set of challenges – shifting disease burden, increased expenditure on health and long-term care, labor-force shortages, dissaving, potential problems with old-age income security, and many more.\xa0', 'An aging population affects economies in many ways – the growth of GDP slows, there is a shortage of a skilled labor force, working-age people pay more to support the elderly, and public budgets strain under the burden of the higher total cost of health and retirement programs for old people.\xa0', 'However, new research suggests that an aging population could also, in fact, be good for economic growth, thanks in part to automation and technology. Economists from the prestigious MIT hypothesize that as populations age, businesses are more likely to adopt new technology that helps boost productivity. They argue that as the population ages, the number of working-age people declines relative to demand, which in turn causes an uptick in wages. These higher wages can then incentivize businesses to invest in technology and digitize most of their process, thus boosting productivity to such an extent that it even offsets the reduction in economic growth from the older population, or might even overwhelm it and cause an economic upswing.\xa0', 'Longevity economy is a concept that people living healthier, longer lives than previously have the potential to, in fact, be positive for the economy, thus offsetting the negative economic effects of an aging society. A key goal for the longevity economy is to raise employment over the life course, which in turn will require boosting human capital and productivity as older workers seek to maintain their skills for longer. An important component of boosting employment is the extension of working lives. Estimates for the U.K. suggest that a 1-year extension of working life also causes a GDP growth of 1%, and hence we’ve seen several countries around the world implement plans to raise the retirement age for their people.\xa0', 'By 2015, there were more than 1.6 billion people in the world who were part of the 50-plus cohort and this number is expected to double to nearly 3.2 billion by 2050. The global longevity economy consists of the vast economic impact of people aged 50 and over – within and across nations – driving the GDP growth, job creation, and income generation. According to AARP, people aged 50 and over contributed $45 trillion to global GDP in 2020, and by 2050, their contribution is expected to more than double to $118 trillion.', 'Although employers regularly tend to overlook the resumes of middle-aged and older applicants, some companies understand and appreciate the value, wisdom, and insight older workers can bring to the workforce – like being great mentors, or even mentees.\xa0', 'The American Association of Retired Persons Employer Pledge Program is a nationwide group of employers that stand with AARP in affirming the value of experienced workers and are committed to developing diverse organizations.
