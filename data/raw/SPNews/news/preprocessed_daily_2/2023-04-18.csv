1,96cb2751-b82b-3661-b935-16eaae137331,SCHW,2023-04-18,Should You Tap Charles Schwab's Q1 Earnings With ETFs?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tap-charles-schwabs-q1-earnings-091309989.html,1681809189,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Charles Schwab Corporation SCHW reported strong Q1 2023 earnings, surpassing earnings expectations and driving up its stock price. The company's stock jumped by more than 3.9% in the key trading session on Apr 17.The financial services company has reported Q1 2023 adjusted earnings of 93 cents per share, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents. The earnings also saw a jump of 21% from the previous year's quarter.  The results excluded acquisition and integration-related costs as well as amortization of acquired intangibles.The net income (GAAP basis) for the quarter was $1.6 billion or 83 cents per share, up from $1.4 billion or 67 cents per share in the same quarter last year. Our projection for earnings per share (GAAP basis) was 80 cents.The company's Q1 results were boosted by higher rates, which resulted in an increase in net interest income (NII). This led to revenue growth, despite lower bank deposit fees and volatile market conditions negatively affecting trading income. The absence of fee waivers and solid brokerage account numbers also had a positive impact on the quarter's results. However, higher expenses were a hindering factor.The company's Q1 net revenues amounted to $5.12 billion, showing a growth of 10% compared to the previous year. The increase was primarily due to a 27% rise in NII, although a significant decline of 49% in bank deposit fees offset some of the gains. However, the company's top line failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.15 billion. Our own estimate for this metric was $5.3 billion.Should You Tap Charles Schwab’s Q1 Earnings With ETFs?Since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the brokerage has been experiencing significant pressure as investors are concerned about the possibility of a similar outcome for the company. However, Schwab noted that its loan-to-deposit ratio is low in an attempt to soothe anxious investors’ nerves. Also, the suspension of its share repurchase program turned investors pessimistic.Story continuesIn late-March, Morgan Stanley downgraded Charles Schwab due to the chances of extended earnings recovery timeline, as quoted on CNBC. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at the time of writing.Against this backdrop, investors can play ETFs that are heavy on the company. The basket approach lessens the company specific risks. ETFs in FocusOne ETF that investors may consider to play Schwab’s decent Q1 earnings is the iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers &amp; Securities Exchanges ETF IAI. This ETF invests in companies that operate as broker-dealers or securities exchanges, including Charles Schwab. As one of the leading broker-dealers in the industry, Schwab’s positive earnings report is likely to have a positive impact on IAI. The SCHW takes about 20.64% of the fund. The fund was up 1.5% on Apr 17.Another ETF to watch in light of Schwab’s Q1 earnings is Amplify Digital &amp; Online Trading ETF (BIDS). The underlying BlueStar Global E-Brokers and Digital Capital Markets Index tracks the performance of companies engaged in online securities brokerage and lending, market making and digital asset capital markets.  Charles Schwab takes the top position with about 9.42% exposure.Finally, the God Bless America ETF YALL is another ETF to consider in light of Schwab’s strong Q1 earnings. The fund was up 0.5% on Apr 17. This ETF invests in companies that provide exposure to various sectors with financials stocks taking a decent share. Charles Schwab takes about 4.9% of the fund.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

You can see the Dow up almost 100 points. The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ up about a 1/3 of a percent. There is your closing bell on Wall Street for this Monday, the 17th.INES FERRE: And looking at the market action, we are seeing the sectors. That one today, though, is being real estate and financials, those were the leaders throughout the session today. And energy, communication services, and health care, those were the laggards.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, big banks had been the story thus far in the quarter today. We got Stage Street, M&amp;T, and of course, we got Charles Schwab. Reportings were mixed, exceeding expectations on the bottom line for the first quarter. The company also announced it will pause its share buyback program amid the recent banking crisis and regulatory uncertainty. A winner on the day, if there was a loser, it certainly was State Street, but Charles Schwab really emerging not hurt.INES FERRE: Yeah, not hurt. Charles Schwab, we should say, really took a blow during the financial crisis that we had recently. I mean, along with the regional banks, and that's because of its positions with bonds. But they came out early on and said, look, we've got plenty of liquidity. We don't have to sell bonds prematurely. We're fine. But still, the stock, year to date, is down about 30-- almost 37%, 36% right there. Lulu--DAVE BRIGGS: Just real quick, wanted to add we're watching deposits down 30% in Q1 from a year earlier and 11% since the end of last year.]"

7,e1d57d2a-87b0-3b83-a58e-bc6fe6479e67,RRC,2023-04-18,Analysts Estimate Range Resources (RRC) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-range-resources-rrc-140002770.html,1681740002,STORY,['RRC'],"[The market expects Range Resources (RRC) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis independent oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.74 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -37.3%.Revenues are expected to be $824.18 million, down 16.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 16.02% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Range Resources?For Range Resources, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -6.65%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Range Resources will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Range Resources would post earnings of $1.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.30, delivering a surprise of +16.07%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Range Resources doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:AYI) At US$160?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investigate-acuity-brands-inc-nyse-120454805.html,1681819494,STORY,['AYI'],"[Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE:AYI), is not the largest company out there, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$200 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$158. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Acuity Brands' current trading price of US$160 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Acuity Brands’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Acuity Brands What Is Acuity Brands Worth?Great news for investors – Acuity Brands is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $221.06, but it is currently trading at US$160 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Acuity Brands’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of Acuity Brands look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a negative profit growth of -0.5% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for Acuity Brands. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although AYI is currently undervalued, the negative outlook does bring on some uncertainty, which equates to higher risk. I recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to AYI, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AYI for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you research further into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurance company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.81 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.06 billion, up 17.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.09% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Brown &amp; Brown?For Brown &amp; Brown, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.12%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Brown &amp; Brown will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Brown &amp; Brown would post earnings of $0.44 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.50, delivering a surprise of +13.64%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Brown &amp; Brown appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsMarsh &amp; McLennan (MMC), another stock in the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $2.45 for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +6.5%.

The team was one of 12 finalists selected from a competitive field of 95 teams, with innovative projects targeting impact in 27 countries.The winning team of graduate students from Gulu University Faculty of Agriculture and Environment in Uganda was awarded the top prize for their Village Savings and Agriculture Insurance proposal. The team proposed an insurance instrument that would underwrite vulnerable crops and keep smallholder farmers afloat who may have previously been considered too high-risk to insure. Their proposal draws on local village savings and loan agencies, making insurance coverage affordable while also promoting financial stability and sustainable economic growth in rural Ugandan communities.Launched in 2011, the Kellogg-Morgan Stanley Sustainable Investing Challenge is an annual global competition designed to inspire future leaders to develop innovative financial vehicles to help address critical social and environmental issues. The finalists pitched a wide variety of ideas, illustrating the breadth of sustainable investing possibilities – including financing tools that address the vaccination gap in Sub-Saharan Africa, water scarcity in the U.S. Colorado River Basin, and fast-fashion supply chain sustainability in Vietnam.Story continues""This year’s teams showed us that the world’s environmental and social challenges are deeply interconnected, and to solve them we need new and innovative ideas,"" says Jessica Alsford, Morgan Stanley’s Chief Sustainability Officer and CEO of the Institute for Sustainable Investing.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Electric Utility Stocks To Buy Now. The utilities sector is known for being one of the most defensive parts of the economy because even during tough economic times, households and businesses continue to use electricity. By the mid of 2022, the utilities sector had gone from being one of the poorest performing sectors in the S&amp;P 500 to becoming one of the best. In 2023, the economy and markets may continue to face various challenges, such as increasing interest rates, high inflation, political instability, and slowing global growth. Despite this, the utilities sector may remain popular due to its defensive characteristics, including reliable cash flows and dividends. According to Fidelity Investments, the long-term prospects for utilities could be even more promising. As renewable energy sources become increasingly cost-effective compared to fossil fuels, utilities are at the forefront of the shift towards clean energy. Consumers, businesses, and governments are also actively seeking ways to reduce their carbon footprint. These factors are leading to accelerated earnings growth for the utilities sector, with the average earnings growth recently reaching the highest levels in decades. The utilities sector may have a positive outlook for performance due to a combination of challenging economic conditions and long-term favorable trends resulting from the transition to renewable energy sources.Previously, we reported that as we headed into the fourth quarter of 2022, utilities stocks were performing better than the overall market by more than 30%. Moreover, utilities have been able to maintain strong returns even in challenging economic conditions. As of October 2022, only the utilities and energy sectors had seen positive gains. During previous recessionary periods, such as in 2001 and 2007-2009, utilities have also performed well due to their resilience in these conditions. In 2022, there was a shift in the market's leadership, which worked in favor of the utilities sector. At the beginning of the year, utilities were relatively undervalued compared to technology and growth segments, which had seen significant growth during the pandemic surge.Story continuesAccording to analysts and researchers, US electric utilities with existing renewable power projects and plans for future projects will benefit the most from the new federal clean energy funding. The Biden administration's $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act includes billions of dollars in tax credits and direct payments for solar, wind, battery, and other renewable energy sources, with the aim of transitioning away from fossil fuels in the electric power supply. The utilities that are already leading in developing solar and wind energy will be the ones to gain the most from this initiative. Ryan Kronk, power markets analyst at consultancy Rystad Energy, told Reuters on February 7, 2023: ""The main beneficiaries are likely going to be the utilities that eventually acquire (these) projects and already had some in the pipeline.""To benefit from the upcoming waves in the utility sector, some of the best stocks to invest in include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D), and PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG).

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 63% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Monster Beverage, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Monster Beverage ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Monster Beverage?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Monster Beverage already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Monster Beverage's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Monster Beverage. The company's largest shareholder is The Coca-Cola Company, with ownership of 20%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.0% and 5.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOn further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 8 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Monster BeverageThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Monster Beverage Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. But they may have an indirect interest through a corporate structure that we haven't picked up on. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$238m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 10% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Monster Beverage. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Private Company OwnershipIt seems that Private Companies own 8.0%, of the Monster Beverage stock. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 18% of the Monster Beverage shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

PM is likely to register a top-line increase from the respective year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading when it reports first-quarter 2023 earnings on Apr 20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $8,065 million, suggesting a rise of 4.1% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has remained unchanged in the past 30 days at $1.33 per share. However, the figure indicates a decline of 14.7% from the figure reported in the prior-year fiscal quarter. This tobacco giant has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 10.9%, on average. PM delivered an earnings surprise of 7.8% in the last reported quarter.We expect first-quarter revenues to decrease 5.5% year over year to $7,319.2 million and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to drop 15.4% to $1.32.Philip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Philip Morris International Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayPhilip Morris has been benefiting from its strong pricing power. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases due to the addictive quality of cigarettes. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance (mainly due to increased combustible tobacco pricing) in the fourth quarter of 2022. The continuation of this trend remains positive.Philip Morris’ focus on smoke-free products has also been working well. The company is progressing well with its business transformation, with smoke-free products generating 36% of its net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022. PM is well-placed toward becoming a majority smoke-free company by 2025. To this end, the company’s IQOS, a heat-not-burn device, counts as one of the leading reduced-risk products (RRPs) in the industry.In the fourth quarter of 2022, revenues from smoke-free products (excluding Wellness and Healthcare) jumped 23% to $2,866 million. Total IQOS users at the end of the fourth quarter were estimated at roughly 24.9 million (including nearly 17.8 million who switched to IQOS and stopped smoking).For 2023, PM expects net revenues to increase by nearly 7-8.5% on an organic basis, driven by higher combustible pricing and the continued progress of IQOS. This also bodes well for the quarter under review.However, the company has been battling cost-related headwinds for a while now. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the adjusted operating income margin was somewhat affected by increased manufacturing costs (mainly due to escalated logistics costs and other inflationary impacts).Management expects certain margin pressures in the first half of 2023. It anticipates the first quarter to be the most difficult, wherein it expects EPS in the band of $1.28-$1.33, including currency headwinds. This indicates heated tobacco unit shipment volumes of about 26-28 billion units, organic top-line growth in the low single digits and lower margins. These raise concerns for the first-quarter bottom line.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Philip Morris this time.

The Federal Reserve's efforts to tame inflation through aggressive interest rate increases have also raised concerns about an economic downturn.Goldman booked a $470 million loss on the sale of some loans from Marcus, dragging down first quarter results. The bank also released $440 million from its reserves to soften the hit from its consumer loan portfolio.Goldman sold $1 billion worth of loans from its Marcus portfolio and plans to further reduce the portfolio, Chief Financial Officer Denis Coleman told analysts.""Goldman got into the consumer business at the wrong time shortly before the downturn, and they are re-imagining parts of the business by getting out of lending and focusing on deposits,"" Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research, told Reuters. ""It just puts Goldman in kind of an awkward space in the consumer market.""The bank's net profit applicable to common shareholders fell to $3.09 billion in the quarter, compared with $3.83 billion a year earlier, while earnings per share slid to $8.79 from $10.76 last year, it said on Tuesday.Story continuesExcluding onetime costs, the Wall Street heavyweight earned $9.87 per share, exceeding the analysts' average estimate of $8.10 per share, according to Refinitiv data.Its stock fell 1.7% to $333.91 in afternoon trading.Global mergers and acquisitions activity shrank to the lowest level in more than a decade in the first quarter, according to data from Dealogic. That hurt Goldman's investment banking fees, which dropped 26% to $1.58 billion.Revenue from fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) trading, usually a bright spot, plunged 17% to $3.93 billion, while equity trading revenue sank 7% to $3.02 billion.""The revenue shortfall versus our expectations came mainly on FICC trading and equity investments, which are of course both relatively volatile,"" Chris Kotowski, a banking analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co, wrote in a note.Revenue in Goldman's asset and wealth management unit rose 24% to $3.2 billion. Still, that reflected a 10% decline from the end of the fourth quarter last year.Net revenue fell 5% to $12.22 billion in the first quarter.Goldman is exploring strategic options for its consumer platform business, which has lost about $3 billion in three years, executives told investors in February. It's also considering a sale for GreenSky, a fintech business that it bought for more than $2 billion in 2021.But deposits held in the Marcus business remain core to Goldman and are not under review, a source familiar with the matter had told Reuters earlier this year.Goldman reshuffled its main divisions in 2022, shifting the focus back to its traditional mainstays of trading and investment banking, beefing up its asset management arm and stepping back from its consumer aspirations.Rival Morgan Stanley, which has diversified its business by concentrating on wealth management, reports results on Wednesday.Goldman's lackluster trading results contrast with those of Bank of America Corp, which also reported earnings on Tuesday. BofA's profit beat analysts' estimates after its bond traders had their best quarter in a decade.""Goldman was uncharacteristically weak in trading compared to other banks and it is unlikely to continue at the first quarter pace, so we can expect some more softening in performance,"" Biggar added.(Reporting by Niket Nishant and Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru and Nupur Anand and Saeed Azhar in New York; Editing by Lananh Nguyen, Arun Koyyur, Nick Zieminski, Anna Driver editing by Jonathan Oatis)]"

That was down 18% from a year ago, making it the first of the giant banks to report a drop from the year-earlier period.Several of its mainstay revenue sources sputtered as investors fretted about everything from higher interest rates to the failures of two sizable regional banks in March. Investment banking revenue was down 26%, as new deals dried up, and advisory fees were down 27%. Revenues from fixed-income trading, another traditional Goldman strength, also fell. Goldman's stock closed Tuesday down 1.7%.Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a conference call with analysts that he expects ""big strategic"" deal activity in the second half of the year but acknowledged that there is now a “higher risk of a credit contraction” following the turmoil of last month.""We continue to be cautious about the economic outlook.""Bank of America, which has a bigger consumer lending business than Goldman but also a sizable Wall Street unit, reported earnings of $8.2 billion that were up 15% from the first quarter of 2022. Its stock rose less than 1% Tuesday.Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan struck a positive note about the state of the American consumer in a conference call with analysts even as he noted that his research team expects a recession in the third quarter.Payments from consumers, he said, continue ""to drive the US economy"" and the financial position of these consumers ""remains generally healthy."" Credit and debit card spending tracked by Bank of America was up 6%. The bank did, however, set aside reserves of $360 million for future losses in its consumer unit due primarily to higher-than-expected credit card balances.Story continuesBank of America outperformed Goldman in one key Wall Street category with a rise in trading, especially fixed income. Another key driver of earnings was its net interest income, which is the difference between what a bank earns on its loans and pays out on its deposits.The Federal Reserve's aggressive rise in interest rates over the past year boosted this measure of income for Bank of America and other giant consumer banks, including JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), because it allowed them to charge more for their loans. Bank of America's net interest income was up 25% compared to the year-ago quarter.The concern now is that those margins could begin to fall across the industry as banks begin to pay more aggressively for deposits and lure new customers with higher rates.Bank of America's net interest income was roughly flat when compared to the fourth quarter, dropping by a slight $233 million, as were total loans. Investors are concerned banks could pull back on new loans, which would affect the larger economy by reducing the flow of credit to businesses and consumers.There are signs that Bank of America is beginning to shell out more to keep and attract depositors. It paid 1.38% on average on interest-bearing deposit accounts in the first quarter, versus 0.96% in the fourth quarter.Even before the turmoil in March, lenders big and small had been losing depositors to money market funds that were willing to offer higher yields. Bank of America couldn't escape that trend. Its deposits at the end of the quarter were $1.9 trillion, down $20 billion from the end of 2022 and $162 billion from a year earlier.Its deposit rates are still low when compared to many other banks, as Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo highlighted during a conference call with executives Tuesday. ""You have the lowest payment on deposits,"" he said. ""What keeps your customers around?"" Executives told him depositors stick with the bank because the majority use it for everyday payments and have been customers for more than a decade.Goldman also lost consumer deposits during the period ending March 31. They were down 3% from a year ago and the last quarter as customers pulled $11.6 billion from Goldman's banking division during the first three months of the year. The bank's deposit balances at the quarter's end were at their lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2021.Goldman has been reevaluating its foray into consumer banking and seeking strategic options for that part of its business. Its results released Tuesday included a loss of about $470 million related to a partial sale of a loans portfolio.On Monday Apple (AAPL) said Monday that it is launching high-yield savings accounts for Apple Card holders in partnership with Goldman, marking the tech company's latest foray into payments.""This gives us another deposit channel,"" Solomon told analysts Tuesday. ""This is an interesting opportunity for the firm.""Some of the challenges in Goldman's more traditional Wall Street businesses were the result of a larger slowdown in markets during the first quarter and greater uncertainty about the economic outlook. A number of big banks, from JPMorgan to Bank of America, said that investment banking fees were down during the quarter. Many of these giant banks also reported less fees from underwriting as IPOs slowed.Trading revenues at Goldman also fell 13%, including a 17% drop in fixed-income trading. Bank of America, by contrast, actually increased its fixed-income trading revenue from a year ago by 27%.Solomon, Goldman's CEO, said the company's fixed-income trading drop is partly because of ""significant outperformance"" in the year-ago quarter. The company still collected revenues from that business of $4 billion.""It was a solid performance,"" he said.JMP Securities' Devin Ryan told Yahoo Finance it was a ""good quarter"" for Goldman despite some of the ""noise"" Tuesday. The company, he said, has some chances now to grab some new market share from all of the recent banking stress.""Goldman has navigated a lot of crises over its history and through those crises it takes market share,"" he said.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Better-than-expected results in the past week from bellwethers like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C) calmed the market to a large extent, but there is still reason for caution.Yahoo Finance spoke to several banking experts who gave their assessment on the current environment. American Banker’s John Heltman says it’s too early to call the crisis over before we see quarterly results from more mid-size regional banks. Quant Insight Head of Analytics Huw Roberts says he feels the crisis is largely contained and credits the Fed for restoring order. ‘I think you have to give credit to the Fed and other authorities for the speed at which they moved,’ he said.Key video moments:00:00:13 banking crisis 'feels contained'00:00:40 why deposits are 'leaving the system'00:00:55 moving from crisis to stabilization phaseVideo TranscriptINES FERRE: Is the banking crisis over?HUW ROBERTS: I hope so. It does feel like it's largely contained. And although they have their detractors, I think you have to give credit to the Fed and other authorities for the speed at which they moved. I think maybe the debate now has probably moved on to the extent that we're seeing the big bank, kind of small regional bank divide open up. And that's what this week's earnings will be so critical on.BEN LAIDLER: We're not saying there's a banking crisis, but we have lived through a scare. So I think deposits are leaving the system. They're being attracted into money market funds by the 5% rates that are on offer versus the sub 1% you get at your bank. That predates SVB and the recent banking scare. So I think that's going to continue.MICHAEL ROSE: We think we are moving from the crisis phase to the stabilization phase. And I think as we move into earnings season, what we're going to see is trends that we expected to envelop as the banking crisis did play out, which is deposits, deposits, deposits, meaning flows, deposit flows, deposit costs, and the mix of deposits, changing from those that are non-interest bearing to interest bearing.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you think the crisis is over, or this might flare up again over the summer?JOHN HELTMAN: I think it's too early to say with any definitive knowledge. The place to watch is the midsized regionals, the PNCs, the M&amp;Ts.]"

This compares to our projection of first-quarter revenues of $753.5 million, representing a decline of 24.8%.The company’s respiratory product revenue is expected to be in the range of $262 million to $267 million, including COVID-19 product revenue of $212 million to $217 million. Non-respiratory product revenue is expected to be in the range of $578 million to $583 million, representing 5% growth on a supplemental combined basis and 7% growth on a constant currency basis at the midpoint.Per management, the uptick in the first-quarter revenues was primarily driven by QuidelOrtho’s Labs business unit, including an approximate $21 million settlement related to one of its collaboration agreements.Management is also upbeat about its improving supply chain and is currently focused on its key growth drivers. This raises our optimism about the stock.A Brief Q1 AnalysisPer management, QuidelOrtho’s strong start to its first quarter has been supported by delivering more instruments, driving strong results in its Labs business and better-than-expected results in the Point-Of-Care (POC) business. Management also added that the company had delivered solid non-respiratory revenue growth across all major geographic regions, with notable strength in China. This demonstrated the power of its newly created scale, a wide range of offerings across the diagnostics continuum and the durability of its business model.Over the past few months, QuidelOrtho has also been witnessing strength in its POC and Transfusion Medicine business units, which also looks promising for the stock. QuidelOrtho is also expected to witness strength in its overall business with its ongoing integration, thereby creating new cross-selling opportunities.Story continuesIn March, QuidelOrtho announced that it had been granted a De Novo request from the FDA, allowing the company to market its new Sofia 2 SARS Antigen+ FIA (fluorescent immunoassay). This looks promising for the stock.The company’s preliminary projection of robust improvement in revenues on the back of strength in its businesses lifts our confidence about the stock.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 3.9% between Jan 2 and Apr 2, 2023 compared with the industry’s 0.5% rise and the S&amp;P 500’s 7.4% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, QuidelOrtho carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

VEEV is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of a strong product portfolio. The optimism led by a solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 performance, along with strong product adoption, is expected to contribute further. Stiff competition and forex woes persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 4.9% compared with the 20.3% decline of the industry and a 6.3% fall of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned provider of cloud-based software applications and data solutions for the life sciences industry has a market capitalization of $28.59 billion. The company projects 23% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 6.5% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Product Portfolio: We are optimistic about Veeva Systems’ unique solutions, which include Veeva Vault, Veeva CRM (customer relationship management), Veeva Network and Veeva OpenData. In October 2022, the company announced Veeva Vault CRM for MedTech, a unified CRM and content management application built for MedTech sales teams, key account managers and medical affairs professionals. The same month, the company announced the availability of Veeva ePRO, a key advancement in patient-centric digital trials.Product Adoption: We are upbeat about Veeva Systems registering a robust adoption for its products over the past few months. In March, the company announced that more than 100 life sciences companies are using Veeva CRM Events Management to plan and execute in-person, virtual and hybrid events worldwide.Veeva Systems, in February, announced that biopharmas are leveraging Veeva Vault PromoMats for modular content to accelerate medical, legal and regulatory reviews and drive more impactful engagement across channels and regions.Strong Q4 Results: Veeva Systems’ solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy optimism. The company saw an uptick in the overall top and bottom lines and robust performances by both segments during the quarter. The company continued to benefit from its flagship Vault platform, which is encouraging. Veeva Systems’ continued strength in its Commercial Solutions, with new small- to mid-sized customer additions, looked promising.Story continuesDownsidesForex Woes: Veeva Systems derives a major share of its revenues from international operations. Some of its international agreements provide payment denominated in local currencies and the majority of its local costs are also denominated in local currencies. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies may impact its operating results when converted into U.S. dollars.Stiff Competition: Veeva Systems operates in a highly competitive market. In new sales cycles within the company’s largest product categories, it competes with other cloud-based solutions from providers that make applications for the life sciences industry. The company’s Commercial Cloud and Veeva Vault application suites also compete to replace client-server-based legacy solutions offered by large companies and other smaller application providers.Estimate TrendVeeva Systems is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for fiscal 2024. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 3.3% south to $4.33.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $517.6 million, suggesting a 2.5% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.This compares to our fiscal first-quarter revenue estimate of $515.1 million, suggesting a 2% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

HSIC has been gaining from its strategic acquisitions and partnerships. Strong potential in the company’s dental technology joint venture (JV), Henry Schein One, buoys optimism. Meanwhile, favorable trends in the end markets position the company well for further growth.Over the past six months, the stock has gained 20.4% compared with the 16.7% growth of the industry and the 11% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global distributor of healthcare products and services has a market capitalization of $10.81 billion. Its fourth-quarter 2022 earnings were in-line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Courtesy of solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock is an attractive pick for investors at the moment.Factors at PlayMarket Dynamics: Henry Schein stands to gain from several favorable trends in the end markets. One of the major positives is demographics. The increasing number of lives covered, following the healthcare reforms in the United States is likely to benefit the company.We believe that an aging population and increasing healthcare expenditure across the globe will aid in providing additional top-line opportunities. Further, the company’s medical segment continues to grow as it gains traction in large group practices including those within health systems.Moreover, Henry Schein is upbeat about the expected increase in dental insurance coverage along with lower insurance reimbursement rates leading to a rising need for new technologies. We believe this will boost demand for its products and services as well.Henry Schein One Holds Potential: Henry Schein seems to be optimistic about its dental technology JV Henry Schein One. The dental software business has been progressing well, despite a challenging business environment.During the fourth quarter, Henry Schein One registered solid sales growth domestically and internationally, supported by its Dentrix practice management software and Dendrix Ascend and entirely cloud-based solutions. The company now has close to 6000 cloud-based customers. In the past few months, it launched entirely across the United Kingdom, and in Australia and New Zealand, and remains on track for further geographic expansion in 2023.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarlier, Henry Schein announced that Dentrix Ascend was selected as the exclusive cloud-based practice management system for small brands, a dental service organization, and a DSO organization with more than 700 locations, reflecting the competitive advantage of this product offering.Expansion Through Acquisitions and Partnerships: Henry Schein’s revenue growth has been consistently supported by niche acquisitions and partnerships. Its robust acquisition strategy helps it to pursue targets that provide access to additional product lines.During the fourth quarter, the company acquired Midway Dental in the United States and Condor Dental in Switzerland, expanding its reach into underpenetrated areas in the market.In January 2023, Henry Schein’s subsidiary, eAssist Dental Solutions (eAssist), acquired a majority interest in Unitas PPO Solutions (Unitas). Unitas is a privately-held service provider that works with dental practices to assess their commercial insurance participation, set competitive fee-for-service rates and negotiate contracted reimbursement with commercial insurers (PPO plans). The acquisition advances and accelerates the development of value-added services offered by Henry Schein Dental and further fortifies the company’s commitment to be a trusted advisor to customers.Upbeat Guidance: For 2023, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.25-$5.42 (excluding amortization expense of acquired intangible assets). This implies growth of (2%) to 1% from the 2022 figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is currently pegged at $4.95.For 2023, Henry Schein expects sales growth of nearly 1-3% over 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $12.83 billion.Estimate TrendThe company has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023.

Is Hologic (HOLX) one of those stocks right now?

60,e868e72d-647e-3bab-8bae-3314f6083da0,HOLX,2023-04-18,"Hologic, Inc. (HOLX) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hologic-inc-holx-trending-stock-130001739.html,1681736401,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this medical device maker have returned +9.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.7% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Hologic belongs, has gained 5.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.88 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -57.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.74 points to a change of -37.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.99 indicates a change of +6.7% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Hologic.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for HOLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Hologic, the consensus sales estimate of $967.05 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -32.6%. The $3.97 billion and $4.13 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -18.4% and +4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $1.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -27%. EPS of $1.07 for the same period compares with $2.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $980.98 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.5%. The EPS surprise was +18.89%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Industry growth in the year to March also almost doubled, although a marginal miss on forecasts.While last week's news of a March China export boom largely prepared markets for Tuesday's data beat, one upshot is that economists are now revising full-year growth forecasts higher. JPMorgan upgraded its 2023 call for China to 6.4% versus 6.0% on the news.That rebound in global demand was also reflected in the latest U.S. factory soundings. The New York Federal Reserve said on Monday its barometer of manufacturing activity in New York State increased for the first time in five months in April as measures of new orders and shipments surged.With March starts and permits numbers out later, there was also signs of a troughing in the U.S. housing market. Confidence among U.S. single-family homebuilders improved for a fourth straight month in April as a dearth of previously owned homes and falling mortgage rates boosted demand.Aside from the surprising miss from State Street, which saw its shares lose more than 9% on Monday, the rest of the big banks reporting first-quarter earnings appear to have put the March stress behind them.Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon are among the big names reporting on Tuesday, along with streaming giant Netflix.With attention on the extent of deposit flight from smaller U.S. banks, deposit rates are being forced higher and the improvement on returns for savers is likely to be both a drag on banks going forward but also a boon to household wealth.Story continuesAs depositors demanded greater security and better returns, Apple said it aims to attract U.S. savers with a new high-yield deposit account, partnering with Goldman Sachs to offer users of its Apple Card 4.15% on savings accounts - 10 times higher than the national average.The upshot for markets has been to underline recent stock market gains but switch the spotlight back on interest rates, which are creeping higher again as the worst fears for the March banking shock retreat into the rearview mirror.Wall St futures were higher again on Tuesday, with European bourses and most Asia indices advancing too. The VIX volatility gauge continued falling to its lowest since Jan 5, 2022.The take on the Fed is that futures now see a 90% chance of another quarter-point rate hike next month, with prior assumptions of a reversal of that move by September now being pushed out to November and year-end rates nudging up to 4.55%. Two-year Treasury yields hovered close to one-month highs of 4.21%.With euro zone and UK rate expectations pushing higher too, the dollar slipped back again against the euro and sterling.British wages rose faster than anticipated last month, in a move that economists judge may tip the Bank of England towards a further rise in interest rates next month, despite an unexpected increase in joblessness too.As a reflection of how markets' prevailing views are being questioned, Bank of America's latest survey of fund managers showed investors had lifted bond allocations in April to the highest since 2009 and kept cash levels at an elevated 5.5%.The resurfacing of U.S. debt ceiling tensions this week was another irritant for U.S. interest rates and bond markets on Tuesday, with the day's deadline for annual U.S. tax returns likely to allow a more accurate update on how long the Treasury coffers will last without a debt cap extension.Elsewhere, billionaire Elon Musk said on Monday he will launch an artificial intelligence (AI) platform that he calls ""TruthGPT"" to challenge the offerings from Microsoft and Google.Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday: * U.S. March housing starts/permits, New York Fed's April service sector survey; Canada March inflation * U.S. Federal Reserve Board Governor Michelle Bowman speaks, Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem testifies to parliament; Bank of England Executive Director for International Banks Supervision Sarah Breeden speaks * U.S. corporate earnings: Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Bank of New York Mellon, Western Alliance Bancorp, Netflix, Lockheed Martin, Prologis, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Omnicom, Intuitive Surgical, United Airlines(By Mike Dolan, mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Amgen What Is Amgen's Net Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of December 2022 Amgen had US$38.9b of debt, an increase on US$33.3b, over one year. However, it does have US$9.31b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$29.6b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Amgen's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Amgen had liabilities of US$15.7b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$45.8b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$9.31b in cash and US$6.39b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$45.8b.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Amgen has a huge market capitalization of US$132.5b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.With a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.2, Amgen uses debt artfully but responsibly. And the fact that its trailing twelve months of EBIT was 7.2 times its interest expenses harmonizes with that theme. Amgen grew its EBIT by 7.8% in the last year. That's far from incredible but it is a good thing, when it comes to paying off debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Amgen can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the last three years, Amgen recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 94% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Our ViewThe good news is that Amgen's demonstrated ability to convert EBIT to free cash flow delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And its interest cover is good too. All these things considered, it appears that Amgen can comfortably handle its current debt levels. On the plus side, this leverage can boost shareholder returns, but the potential downside is more risk of loss, so it's worth monitoring the balance sheet. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Amgen is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to 5 Cheapest Countries for Retirement.The Costs of Living in RetirementOn average, a comfortable retirement in the USA costs an estimated $1 million. With Americans spending $50,220 annually post-retirement, 25% have already begun delaying their retirement plans. A 40-year high inflation, rising interest rates, and pandemic-led supply-chain disruptions are all notable factors causing this delay. CNBC notes that one million dollars in a retirement account two years ago are worth $120,000 less when accounted for inflation today. As a result, 77% of people have no real retirement savings despite moderately saving for their golden years.For those counting on Social Security to survive, funds are guaranteed through 2035 only. With payroll taxes covering only 78% of benefits and an expected 78 million retirees by then, benefits could be cut by as much as 24.9%. S&amp;P 500, which tracks companies like Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Welltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL), and Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) etc. has shed more than 12% in the past year. This shedding, in addition to decreasing consumer confidence has resulted in 21% of individuals putting away less for retirement altogether, notes BMO Real Financial Progress Index. Furthermore, Consumer Price Index data reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has shown an annual gain of 6.4% through the year. As a result, 64% of Americans are now living paycheck to paycheck, and more numbers are taking a dip into their retirement savings.In terms of retirement costs, the most significant expenditure that retirees face is that of housing. Making up 35% of annual expenditures, it includes mortgage or rent, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and repairs. Utilities are excluded. The Consumer Expenditure Survey notes that housing expenditure amounts to $17,472 on average, rising by 5.6% in 2021. The second highest expenditure encountered by retirees is transportation. Including vehicles, insurance, and gas, this expense adds up to $7,492 per year. Food expenses cost $6,599 annually, and utilities cost $3,810. Health care ranks third in the list with $6,833 spent per year. The bulk of this healthcare spending goes to health insurance companies.Story continuesWith typical Medicare beneficiaries spending 25% of social security on out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures, the need for adequate funds is increasing tenfold. It is reported that the sickest seniors have to dedicate more than 90% of their social security funds to healthcare costs. With an estimated 70% of older adults requiring long-term service and support before they die, severe economic hardships are underway.Maneuvering through the Financial VortexTo maintain a pre-retirement income standard, experts agree that individuals should have at least a 70-80% income replacement rate. However, CNBC notes that only 25% of people are able to generate this income today. 51% are reaching retirement with a current income less than 50% of their pre-retirement income. The fall in retirement savings is also due to a dilemma Goldman Sachs refers to as the financial vortex. Baby boomers, millennials, and Generation X are maneuvering through varying financial priorities, complicating their plans related to retirement savings.For retired boomers, fixed-income portfolios are under pressure due to high-interest rates. There is also a notable decline in equity portfolios, in line with an anticipated recession. Millennials are also impacted by high inflation and rising prices. Still, the most impacted is Generation X. Known as the sandwich generation, this generation marks homeowners, parents, and caretakers who are currently peaking their careers. With the most significant retirement balance held by this group, they are also most likely to be impacted by inflation and volatile markets.As such, future retirees must consider part-time work to alleviate their concerns regarding retirement income. Moreover, employers must also play a role in introducing sponsored retirement plans such as the 401 (k) plan offered by major companies like Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) for their employees. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is another company offering some of the best retirement plans. Retirement plans by Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN) help employees accumulate their savings for their golden years. Furthermore, society can also play a role in promotion of facilities for retirees. Welltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL) is one such company that has purchased three distinct senior-living portfolios in partnership with Senior Point Senior Living. Driving the transformation of healthcare infrastructure, Welltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL) invests in improving the health care experience of its customers.Currently, 40% of private sector workers lack a retirement savings plan. SECURE 2.0 Act 2022 intends to lower this figure, meaning Americans are 12 to 15 times more likely to save for retirement in the future. If your retirement savings aren't enough to help you sustain a decent lifestyle, you can relocate to a cheaper country instead. Many countries offer stable economies, beautiful landscapes, a cheaper cost of living, and easy relocation for a comfortable retirement.15 Cheapest Countries for RetirementImage by coombesy from PixabayMethodologyTo find the cheapest countries to retire to, we compared the cost of living, including rent, groceries, and health care, among other factors, in more than 100 countries worldwide based on Numbeo’s 2023 Cost of Living Index.

Demand from European states for gas from the UK usually drops in the warmer summer months, but last year it rose after pipeline supplies from Russia fell amid the Ukraine war.The report said average UK exports to the rest of Europe is expected to be 5.5 bcm, down from 12.16 bcm last summer.""There are hints of greater stability in the energy market going forward as price differentials narrow and forward price curves reduce,"" the report said.European storage levels ended the winter season at 56%, well above the five-year average and is expected to meet a target of 90% full storage by November, the report added.Last year, Britain imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) and exported the regassified fuel via pipeline interconnector, resulting in a 40% rise in LNG imports than a previous peak in 2016. LNG imports would be lower this year, the report said.In a separate report, Britain's Electricity System Operator (ESO) said it expected sufficient electricity supplies this summer and would be able to export some by interconnector cable.""We expect to have sufficient operational surplus to support some exports to Europe throughout summer if needed,"" it said. ESO said electricity prices in Britain were expected to be lower this summer than in 2022 partly due to high European gas storage levels that were helping lower energy prices. But it said prices would still be higher than in summer 2021 before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.British peak summer electricity demand was forecast at 28.3 gigawatts (GW) with minimum demand expected to 15.6 GW. Both figures are slightly lower than in 2022. (Reporting by Marwa Rashad and Susanna Twidale; Editing by)]"

It Was the Bank’s UndoingA $300,000 Salary Feels Like $100,000 in The Priciest US CitiesThe increases, which included records for a single month’s data for coal mining, natural gas output and oil refining, broadly tally with a robust set of import figures last week. But it’s clear that for many markets the additional supply is running ahead of actual consumption in what’s proving to be an uneven recovery. Underpinning the gains was a surge in power demand as electricity generation climbed 5.1% on year, according to the statistics bureau on Tuesday.China’s reopening after the constraints of Covid Zero saw the economy grow 4.5% in the first quarter, handily beating expectations but short of Beijing’s 5% annual target. Property investment continued to contract, a warning sign given the sector’s importance to commodities markets. Retail sales in March shot higher while industrial production missed expectations.The steel market in particular is heavily keyed to indications of building activity, especially ahead of the busy season for construction in the second quarter. Output in March rose 6.9% on year to 95.7 million tons, near a two-year high, although this is one of the markets where demand has so far disappointed.Oil processing rose 8.8% to 63.3 million tons, an all-time high for a single month’s data, as refiners lifted runs to feed post-Covid transport demand, although a recent pullback in diesel consumption tied to trucking is another indicator of China’s patchy recovery.China’s focus on energy security also saw coal miners raise output to record levels despite some short-lived disruptions from deadly accidents. Production increased 4.3% to 417 million tons. Natural gas output rose 4% to 20.5 billion cubic meters, a record for a single month, but a bit weaker than the daily average recorded in January-February’s combined figures when temperatures were colder.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Electric Utility Stocks To Buy Now. The utilities sector is known for being one of the most defensive parts of the economy because even during tough economic times, households and businesses continue to use electricity. By the mid of 2022, the utilities sector had gone from being one of the poorest performing sectors in the S&amp;P 500 to becoming one of the best. In 2023, the economy and markets may continue to face various challenges, such as increasing interest rates, high inflation, political instability, and slowing global growth. Despite this, the utilities sector may remain popular due to its defensive characteristics, including reliable cash flows and dividends. According to Fidelity Investments, the long-term prospects for utilities could be even more promising. As renewable energy sources become increasingly cost-effective compared to fossil fuels, utilities are at the forefront of the shift towards clean energy. Consumers, businesses, and governments are also actively seeking ways to reduce their carbon footprint. These factors are leading to accelerated earnings growth for the utilities sector, with the average earnings growth recently reaching the highest levels in decades. The utilities sector may have a positive outlook for performance due to a combination of challenging economic conditions and long-term favorable trends resulting from the transition to renewable energy sources.Previously, we reported that as we headed into the fourth quarter of 2022, utilities stocks were performing better than the overall market by more than 30%. Moreover, utilities have been able to maintain strong returns even in challenging economic conditions. As of October 2022, only the utilities and energy sectors had seen positive gains. During previous recessionary periods, such as in 2001 and 2007-2009, utilities have also performed well due to their resilience in these conditions. In 2022, there was a shift in the market's leadership, which worked in favor of the utilities sector. At the beginning of the year, utilities were relatively undervalued compared to technology and growth segments, which had seen significant growth during the pandemic surge.Story continuesAccording to analysts and researchers, US electric utilities with existing renewable power projects and plans for future projects will benefit the most from the new federal clean energy funding. The Biden administration's $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act includes billions of dollars in tax credits and direct payments for solar, wind, battery, and other renewable energy sources, with the aim of transitioning away from fossil fuels in the electric power supply. The utilities that are already leading in developing solar and wind energy will be the ones to gain the most from this initiative. Ryan Kronk, power markets analyst at consultancy Rystad Energy, told Reuters on February 7, 2023: ""The main beneficiaries are likely going to be the utilities that eventually acquire (these) projects and already had some in the pipeline.""To benefit from the upcoming waves in the utility sector, some of the best stocks to invest in include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D), and PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG).

D recently received approval from the Virginia State Corporation Commission to develop two dozen new solar and energy storage projects. These developments are expected to help the company meet the growing needs of its customers.Once the projects come online, they will produce more than 800 megawatts (MW) of carbon-free electricity, which, at full capacity, would be able to serve nearly 200,000 homes in Virginia. During the first 10 years of operation, the projects are expected to save more than $250 million in fuel costs for consumers.Renewable EnergyPer a U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report, coal usage for electricity generation is expected to decline going forward. It also projects an increase in renewable energy sources from 22% in 2022 to 26% in 2024.EIA expects the utility operators to add nearly 54.5 gigawatts (GW) of new utility-scale electric-generating capacity to the United States in 2023. It also projects that approximately 29.1 GW out of the total energy capacity will be based on solar power. This clearly indicates the rising usage of solar energy in the production of clean electricity in the United States.The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will support and accelerate the Utilities’ transition toward clean-energy sources. The Act has removed uncertainties related to federal incentives for the usage of renewable sources. It also entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way and is expected to create earnings visibility.Utilities Focus on Clean EnergyAlong with Dominion Energy, some other electric power industry companies like AVANGRID, Inc. AGR, Ameren Corporation AEE, and NextEra Energy, Inc. NEE are adopting measures to meet clean-energy targets.AVANGRID plans to create a clean generation portfolio — coal-free and 91% renewables — and achieve Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon neutrality goals by 2035. In the Renewables segment, nearly 400 MW of new capacity were placed into operation, including its first large-scale solar project and advancing construction of nearly 1.4 gigawatts.AGR’s long-term (three- to five-year) earnings growth is pegged at 4.83%. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 11.17% in the last four quarters.Ameren plans to supply electricity produced from cleaner and more diverse sources of energy generation, including solar, wind, natural gas, hydro and nuclear power. To this end, AEE aims to expand its portfolio by 2,800 MW of renewable generation by the end of 2030, and a total of 4,700 MW of renewable generation and 800 MW of battery storage by 2040.Ameren’s long-term earnings growth is pegged at 6.97%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS is $4.35, implying a year-over-year increase of 5.1%.NextEra Energy aims to reduce total carbon emissions by 67% within 2025 from 2005 base line. It continues to work on its strategy of long-term investment in clean-energy assets. NEE expects to add 33-42 gigawatts of new renewables to the generation portfolio during 2023-2026 via clean-energy investments.The company’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 9.04%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS is pegged at $3.12, implying a year-over-year increase of 7.6%.Story continuesPrice PerformanceIn the past month, shares of Dominion Energy have gained 4.2% compared with the industry’s 3.7% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankDominion Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

86,658a4f2c-33ca-43c5-b544-442af1d5b44c,BK,2023-04-18,Goldman Sachs stumbled while Bank of America surged in first quarter,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-stumbled-while-bank-of-america-surged-in-first-quarter-112543509.html,1681817143,STORY,"['BAC', 'GS', 'BK', 'WFC', 'JPM']","[Profits and revenue rose at Bank of America (BAC) during the first quarter while falling at Goldman Sachs (GS), offering a diverging look at how two financial giants fared during a challenging period for the banking industry and the markets.Goldman, which is more reliant on traditional Wall Street businesses of deal making and trading, reported $3.2 billion in earnings during the quarter ending March 31. That was down 18% from a year ago, making it the first of the giant banks to report a drop from the year-earlier period.Several of its mainstay revenue sources sputtered as investors fretted about everything from higher interest rates to the failures of two sizable regional banks in March. Investment banking revenue was down 26%, as new deals dried up, and advisory fees were down 27%. Revenues from fixed-income trading, another traditional Goldman strength, also fell. Goldman's stock closed Tuesday down 1.7%.Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a conference call with analysts that he expects ""big strategic"" deal activity in the second half of the year but acknowledged that there is now a “higher risk of a credit contraction” following the turmoil of last month.""We continue to be cautious about the economic outlook.""Bank of America, which has a bigger consumer lending business than Goldman but also a sizable Wall Street unit, reported earnings of $8.2 billion that were up 15% from the first quarter of 2022. Its stock rose less than 1% Tuesday.Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan struck a positive note about the state of the American consumer in a conference call with analysts even as he noted that his research team expects a recession in the third quarter.Payments from consumers, he said, continue ""to drive the US economy"" and the financial position of these consumers ""remains generally healthy."" Credit and debit card spending tracked by Bank of America was up 6%. The bank did, however, set aside reserves of $360 million for future losses in its consumer unit due primarily to higher-than-expected credit card balances.Story continuesBank of America outperformed Goldman in one key Wall Street category with a rise in trading, especially fixed income. Another key driver of earnings was its net interest income, which is the difference between what a bank earns on its loans and pays out on its deposits.The Federal Reserve's aggressive rise in interest rates over the past year boosted this measure of income for Bank of America and other giant consumer banks, including JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), because it allowed them to charge more for their loans. Bank of America's net interest income was up 25% compared to the year-ago quarter.The concern now is that those margins could begin to fall across the industry as banks begin to pay more aggressively for deposits and lure new customers with higher rates.Bank of America's net interest income was roughly flat when compared to the fourth quarter, dropping by a slight $233 million, as were total loans. Investors are concerned banks could pull back on new loans, which would affect the larger economy by reducing the flow of credit to businesses and consumers.There are signs that Bank of America is beginning to shell out more to keep and attract depositors. It paid 1.38% on average on interest-bearing deposit accounts in the first quarter, versus 0.96% in the fourth quarter.Even before the turmoil in March, lenders big and small had been losing depositors to money market funds that were willing to offer higher yields. Bank of America couldn't escape that trend. Its deposits at the end of the quarter were $1.9 trillion, down $20 billion from the end of 2022 and $162 billion from a year earlier.Its deposit rates are still low when compared to many other banks, as Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo highlighted during a conference call with executives Tuesday. ""You have the lowest payment on deposits,"" he said. ""What keeps your customers around?"" Executives told him depositors stick with the bank because the majority use it for everyday payments and have been customers for more than a decade.Goldman also lost consumer deposits during the period ending March 31. They were down 3% from a year ago and the last quarter as customers pulled $11.6 billion from Goldman's banking division during the first three months of the year. The bank's deposit balances at the quarter's end were at their lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2021.Goldman has been reevaluating its foray into consumer banking and seeking strategic options for that part of its business. Its results released Tuesday included a loss of about $470 million related to a partial sale of a loans portfolio.On Monday Apple (AAPL) said Monday that it is launching high-yield savings accounts for Apple Card holders in partnership with Goldman, marking the tech company's latest foray into payments.""This gives us another deposit channel,"" Solomon told analysts Tuesday. ""This is an interesting opportunity for the firm.""Some of the challenges in Goldman's more traditional Wall Street businesses were the result of a larger slowdown in markets during the first quarter and greater uncertainty about the economic outlook. A number of big banks, from JPMorgan to Bank of America, said that investment banking fees were down during the quarter. Many of these giant banks also reported less fees from underwriting as IPOs slowed.Trading revenues at Goldman also fell 13%, including a 17% drop in fixed-income trading. Bank of America, by contrast, actually increased its fixed-income trading revenue from a year ago by 27%.Solomon, Goldman's CEO, said the company's fixed-income trading drop is partly because of ""significant outperformance"" in the year-ago quarter. The company still collected revenues from that business of $4 billion.""It was a solid performance,"" he said.JMP Securities' Devin Ryan told Yahoo Finance it was a ""good quarter"" for Goldman despite some of the ""noise"" Tuesday. The company, he said, has some chances now to grab some new market share from all of the recent banking stress.""Goldman has navigated a lot of crises over its history and through those crises it takes market share,"" he said.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

They dropped 13% on a year-over-year basis.The banking crisis along with the already existing concerns about a recession prompted BNY to set aside $27 million in provisions for losses, up from $2 million a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, the bank reported a profit of $1.13 per share, edging past analysts' average estimate of $1.12 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.The New York-based lender's net interest income for the quarter surged 62% to $1.1 billion, compared with $698 million a year earlier.Assets under custody and administration increased 2% to $46.6 trillion, reflecting client inflows and net new business, the bank said.Quarterly revenue jumped 11% to $4.4 billion.(This story has been corrected to change the value of assets under custody and administration to $46.6 trillion, not $46.4 trillion, in paragraph 9; clarifies average deposits, corrects the deposit figure to $274 billion, not $167 billion, in paragraph 5 and adds the dropped dollar sign in the last paragraph)(Reporting by Jaiveer Singh Shekhawat in Bengaluru; Editing by Vinay Dwivedi)]"

Demand from European states for gas from the UK usually drops in the warmer summer months, but last year it rose after pipeline supplies from Russia fell amid the Ukraine war.The report said average UK exports to the rest of Europe is expected to be 5.5 bcm, down from 12.16 bcm last summer.""There are hints of greater stability in the energy market going forward as price differentials narrow and forward price curves reduce,"" the report said.European storage levels ended the winter season at 56%, well above the five-year average and is expected to meet a target of 90% full storage by November, the report added.Last year, Britain imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) and exported the regassified fuel via pipeline interconnector, resulting in a 40% rise in LNG imports than a previous peak in 2016. LNG imports would be lower this year, the report said.In a separate report, Britain's Electricity System Operator (ESO) said it expected sufficient electricity supplies this summer and would be able to export some by interconnector cable.""We expect to have sufficient operational surplus to support some exports to Europe throughout summer if needed,"" it said. ESO said electricity prices in Britain were expected to be lower this summer than in 2022 partly due to high European gas storage levels that were helping lower energy prices. But it said prices would still be higher than in summer 2021 before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.British peak summer electricity demand was forecast at 28.3 gigawatts (GW) with minimum demand expected to 15.6 GW.

Analysts were expecting profits of $6.06 per share.During the quarter, Australia said it would buy 40 Black Hawk military helicopters made by Lockheed from the U.S. for about $1.96 billion as it boosts defense spending over issues with China's presence in the Indo-Pacific region.Lockheed had also finalized a deal to sell 88 F-35 jets to Canada in a $14.2 billion project to replace the country's aging fleet of fighter aircraft.Supply-chain issues stemming from the pandemic are still hurting F-35 production volumes though, pulling down sales at the company's aeronautics unit - its largest - by about 2.1% to $6.27 billion in the quarter.Lockheed's order backlog also fell to $145.1 billion as of quarter-end from $150 billion at the end of 2022.The missiles maker reaffirmed its full-year outlook, projecting net sales in the range of about $65 billion to $66 billion and profits between $26.60 and $26.90 per share.(Reporting by Shivansh Tiwary in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath)]"

As a result, beginning on Jan 1. 2023, intangible asset amortization expense, which was previously included in business segment operating profit, will be reported in unallocated corporate expense within operating income.4The total FAS/CAS pension adjustment is presented as a single amount and includes total expected U.S. Government cost accounting standards (CAS) pension cost of approximately $1.7 billion and total expected financial accounting standards (FAS) pension income of approximately $375 million. The company does not expect to make discretionary contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2023. For additional detail regarding the pension amounts reported in operating and non-operating results, refer to the supplemental table included at the end of this news release.Cash Flows and Capital Deployment ActivitiesCash from operations in the first quarter of 2023 was $1.6 billion and capital expenditures were $294 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.3 billion. The increase in operating and free cash flows in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 was primarily due to various changes in working capital, primarily production and billing cycles impacting contract assets and receivables (primarily F-35 program at Aeronautics and missile programs at Missiles and Fire Control (MFC)), partially offset by the timing of cash payments for accounts payable (primarily Aeronautics).The company's cash activities in the first quarter of 2023, included the following:paying cash dividends of $784 million; andpaying $500 million to repurchase 1.1 million shares (including 0.2 million shares received upon settlement of an accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR) in April 2023).Segment ResultsThe company operates in four business segments organized based on the nature of products and services offered: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space.

The 2022 amounts reflect the impact of this change.Net sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales, and profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation and not included in management's evaluation of performance of each segment. Business segment operating profit includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments.Business segment operating profit excludes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment, a portion of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. Government under the applicable U.S. Government cost accounting standards (CAS) or federal acquisition regulations (FAR), and other items not considered part of management's evaluation of segment operating performance such as a portion of management and administration costs, legal fees and settlements, environmental costs, stock-based compensation expense, retiree benefits, significant severance actions, significant asset impairments, gains or losses from divestitures, intangible asset amortization expense, and other miscellaneous corporate activities. Excluded items are included in the reconciling item ""Unallocated items"" between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit.Changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. In addition, comparability of the company's segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on the company's contracts. Increases in profit booking rates, typically referred to as favorable profit adjustments, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate and are typically referred to as unfavorable profit adjustments. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes.The company's consolidated net favorable profit booking rate adjustments represented approximately 25% and 24% of total segment operating profit in the quarters ended March 26, 2023 and March 27, 2022.Aeronautics (in millions)Quarters EndedMarch 26,2023March 27,2022Net sales$       6,269$       6,401Operating profit675679Operating margin10.8 %10.6 %Aeronautics' net sales in the first quarter of 2023 decreased $132 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of $335 million for the F-35 program due to lower volume on production contracts. This decrease was partially offset by higher sales of $135 million on classified programs due to higher volume and $70 million for the F-16 program due to higher production and sustainment volume.Aeronautics' operating profit in the first quarter of 2023 was comparable to the same period in 2022. Operating profit for the F-35 program was comparable as lower volume on production contracts was mostly offset by contract mix. Operating profit for the F-16 program was comparable as higher volume on production and sustainment contracts was offset by higher unfavorable profit adjustments on a production contract and sustainment contracts. Total net profit booking rate adjustments were approximately $15 million lower in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.Missiles and Fire Control(in millions)Quarters EndedMarch 26,2023March 27,2022Net sales$        2,388$        2,452Operating profit377385Operating margin15.8 %15.7 %MFC's net sales in the first quarter of 2023 decreased $64 million, or 3%, compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of $85 million for sensors and global sustainment programs as net sales for the first quarter of 2022 reflect the impact of a favorable profit adjustment on an international program as a result of a requirements modification that did not recur in the first quarter of 2023; and lower net sales of $60 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to lower volume (Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS)). These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of $70 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to the impact of higher net favorable profit adjustments (Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3)).MFC's operating profit in the first quarter of 2023 decreased $8 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of $85 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to the favorable profit adjustment on an international program in the first quarter of 2022 as described above. This decrease was partially offset by higher operating profit of $60 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to the impact of higher net favorable profit adjustments (PAC-3). In addition, operating margin was positively impacted when compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to contract mix at tactical and strike missiles. Total net profit booking rate adjustments were approximately $25 million lower in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.Rotary and Mission Systems(in millions)Quarters EndedMarch 26,2023March 27,2022Net sales$        3,510$        3,552Operating profit350406Operating margin10.0 %11.4 %RMS' net sales in the first quarter of 2023 decreased $42 million, or 1%, compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of $75 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to lower production volume (Black Hawk); and lower net sales of $60 million for various C6ISR (command, control, communications, computers, cyber, combat systems, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) programs due to lower volume. These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of $85 million for integrated warfare systems and sensors (IWSS) programs due to higher volume (Aegis and TPY-4 programs).RMS' operating profit in the first quarter of 2023 decreased $56 million, or 14%, compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of $65 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to lower production volume, net favorable profit adjustments, and contract mix on the Black Hawk program and unfavorable profit adjustments (CH-53K). Total net profit booking rate adjustments were $35 million lower in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.Space(in millions)Quarters EndedMarch 26,2023March 27,2022Net sales$        2,959$        2,559Operating profit280248Operating margin9.5 %9.7 %Space's net sales in the first quarter of 2023 increased $400 million, or 16%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of $185 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher development volume (Next Generation Interceptor (NGI)); higher net sales of $170 million for national security space programs due to higher development volume (classified programs) and the impact of higher net favorable profit adjustments (Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared geosynchronous satellites (Next Gen OPIR) and classified programs); and higher net sales of $55 million for commercial civil space programs due to higher volume (Orion).Space's operating profit in the first quarter of 2023 increased $32 million, or 13%, compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of $70 million for national security space programs due to the impact of higher net favorable profit adjustments (Next Gen OPIR and classified programs). This increase was partially offset by $45 million of lower equity earnings from the company's investment in United Launch Alliance (ULA) due to lower launch volume and an increase in new product development costs. Total net profit booking rate adjustments were $85 million higher in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.Total equity (losses)/earnings (primarily ULA) represented approximately $(15) million, or (5)%, of Space's operating profit in the first quarter of 2023, compared to approximately $30 million, or 12%, in the first quarter of 2022.Income TaxesThe company's effective income tax rate was 15.3% and 15.9% for quarters ended March 26, 2023 and March 27, 2022. The rates for both periods benefited from research and development tax credits, tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income, dividends paid to the company's defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature, and employee equity awards. The rate for the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022 was lower primarily due to increased research and development tax credits.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis news release contains the following non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) financial measures (as defined by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation G). While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in evaluating the financial performance of the company, this information should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the company's definitions for non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies or analysts.Business segment operating profitBusiness segment operating profit represents operating profit from the company's business segments before unallocated income and expense. This measure is used by the company's senior management in evaluating the performance of its business segments and is a performance goal in the company's annual incentive plan. Business segment operating margin is calculated by dividing business segment operating profit by sales. The table below reconciles the non-GAAP measure business segment operating profit with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, consolidated operating profit.(in millions) 2023 OutlookBusiness segment operating profit (non-GAAP)~$7,255 - $7,355FAS/CAS operating adjustment1~1,660Intangible asset amortization expense~(245)Other, net~(325)Consolidated operating profit (GAAP)~$8,345 - $8,4451Reflects the amount by which expected total CAS pension cost of $1.7 billion, exceeds the expected FAS pension service cost and excludes expected non-service FAS pension income. Refer to the supplemental table ""Selected Financial Data"" included in this news release for a detail of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment.Free cash flowFree cash flow is cash from operations less capital expenditures. The company's capital expenditures are comprised of equipment and facilities infrastructure and information technology (inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software that are capitalized). The company uses free cash flow to evaluate its business performance and overall liquidity and it is a performance goal in the company's annual and long-term incentive plans. The company believes free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it represents the amount of cash generated from operations after reinvesting in the business and that may be available to return to stockholders and creditors (through dividends, stock repurchases and debt repayments) or available to fund acquisitions or other investments. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures, however, because it does not account for certain mandatory expenditures, such as the repayment of maturing debt and pension contributions.Adjusted earnings before income taxes; adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPSEarnings before income taxes, net earnings and diluted earnings per share (EPS) were impacted by certain non-operational items for all periods. Management believes the presentation of these measures adjusted for the impacts of these non-operational items is useful to investors in understanding the company's underlying business performance and comparing performance from period to period. The tax effects related to each adjustment that impacted earnings before income taxes are based on a blended tax rate that combines the federal statutory rate of 21% plus an estimated state tax rate.Total FAS/CAS pension adjustment – adjusted; Total FAS pension income - adjustedTotal FAS/CAS pension adjustment and Total FAS pension income have been adjusted for the noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge recorded in the second quarter 2022. Management believes that the exclusion of the pension settlement charge is useful to understanding the company's underlying business performance and comparing performance from period to period.Webcast and Conference Call InformationLockheed Martin Corporation will webcast live the earnings results conference call (listen-only mode) on Tuesday, April 18, 2023, at 11 a.m. ET on the Lockheed Martin Investor Relations website at www.lockheedmartin.com/investor.

""The Biden Administration supports Türkiye’s efforts to bring the avionics of its F-16 fleet up to standard.""The spokesperson noted that the upgrade will improve the interoperability between Turkish and NATO systems by updating its communications and also provide upgrades to enhance safety measures such as a ground collision avoidance system.The F-16 modernization deal follows Turkey approving Finland's accession to the NATO military alliance and signs of easing tensions between Turkey and neighbor Greece ahead of Turkish elections next month.Lockheed Martin Corp will be the principal contractor on the deal.The package is separate from the proposed $20 billion sale of new Lockheed Martin F-16 fighters and nearly 80 modernization kits that Turkey requested in October 2021.The smaller package was approved after the administration pushed the lawmakers to approve it to send a ""positive signal"" to Ankara, according to one source familiar with the deal.The approval does not mean the bigger sale will receive a green light from Congress as U.S. lawmakers are seeking assurances from Turkey on issues that go beyond the Nordic NATO expansion.Those issues include easing tensions with Greece for good, refraining from an invasion in northern Syria and enforcing sanctions against Russia.Such conditions are likely to anger Turkey, which has said the United States had ""endless"" demands relating to the sale of F-16s and that Washington's behavior wasn't fair.

LLY, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. TMO, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, Boston Scientific Corp. BSX and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. CP.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Top Analyst Reports for Eli Lilly, Thermo Fisher and Lockheed MartinThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Eli Lilly's shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+25.4% vs. +10.3%). The company's revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Trulicity, Taltz and others. Lilly expects to launch four new medicines by 2023 end with Mounjaro for type II diabetes already launched and cancer drug Jaypirca already approved.Mounjaro is off to a solid start. However, the CRL for donanemab and mirikizumab will probably delay potential launch of the candidates by several months.Generic competition for several drugs, rising pricing pressure in the United States mainly on key drugs, Trulicity, and price cuts in some international markets like China, Japan and Europe are a few top-line headwinds. Estimates have gone up slightly ahead of Q1 results. Lilly has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters.(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+3.0% vs. -11.1%). The company's robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising.During the fourth quarter, the company opened a new bioanalytical lab in Richmond, VA to support its clinical research business. The integration of PPD is largely complete and drove strong returns for the shareholders with outstanding execution and business performance throughout the year.However, revenues within Europe declined in the low teens. The same in Asia Pacific fell in the mid-single digits, while China registered a decline in the mid-single digits. Revenues in the rest of the world declined in high-single digits.(You can read the full research report on Thermo Fisher Scientific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Lockheed Martin have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+7.0% vs. -0.1%).

108,3fe5ceb0-a439-39cf-9900-265c0c7826ec,LMT,2023-04-18,Lockheed (LMT) Wins Contract to Build SEWIP AN/SLQ-32(V)6 Systems,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-lmt-wins-contract-build-121412520.html,1681733652,STORY,"['LMT', 'GD', 'LHX', 'NOC']","[Lockheed Martin Corp.’s LMT Rotary and Mission Systems business segment recently clinched a modification contract for Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP). The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC.Details of the DealValued at $63.3 million, the contract is expected to be completed by February 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will be engaged in full-rate production of SEWIP AN/SLQ-32(V)6 and AN/SLQ-32C(V)6 systems.A major part of the work related to this contract will be executed in Liverpool, NY.Importance of SEWIPThe rising threat of missile attacks has been fueling the demand for an effective electronic attack system that excels in defeating inbound threats.In this context, it is imperative to mention that Lockheed’s AN/SLQ-32C(V)6 or “SEWIP Lite” is part of the SEWIP product line. The system provides early detection, analysis, threat warning and protection from anti-ship missiles.SEWIP Lite is capable of both littoral and open ocean electronic surveillance. This system will be installed on fast frigate class and U.S. Coast Guard Offshore Patrol Cutters.Such advantages of the electronic warfare system make it an attractive option for the military, resulting in LMT winning orders for the same, like the latest one. The aforementioned developments, along with Lockheed’s more than 40 years of Integrated Electronic Warfare experience, are likely to boost the company’s revenue-generation prospects from the SEWIP electronic warfare system.Growth ProspectsCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats. As a result, an effective electronic warfare system with anti-missile solution features is likely to witness a pent-up demand.Per a report from the Markets and Markets firm, the global electronic warfare system market is projected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2022-2027. Such growth prospects are likely to benefit Lockheed as its SEWIP product already holds a strong position in the aforementioned market.Story continuesThe abounding growth prospects should also benefit other defense majors who have forayed into the laser-based countermeasure system like Northrop Grumman NOC, L3Harris Technologies LHX and General Dynamics GD.Northrop Grumman’s SEWIP Block 3 is the third in a series of incremental upgrades that adds an electronic attack capability to the AN/SLQ-32 electronic warfare system to defend ships against anti-ship missiles. The SEWIP Block 3 system is inherently multifunctional, creating an expanded mission set to defeat emergent threats and support the U.S. Navy’s Distributed Maritime Operations CONOPS.NOC’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 3.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the prior-year reported figure.L3Harris’ Viper Shield all-digital electronic warfare suite is custom designed to be a baseline on advanced F-16 Block 70/72 aircraft and maximize their survivability and mission success. Some other products of LHX are AN/ALQ-161A, AN / ALQ-211 CV-22, NH 90, F-16 self-protection system, AN / ALQ-214 (IDECM) F/A-18 countermeasure system, etc.The company’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 2.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 3.6% from the prior-year reported figure.Since many years, General Dynamics has been performing as the Lead Systems Integrator for SEWIP Block 1. Its SEWIP, a spiral-block development program, provides an immediate improvement for the legacy surface ship electronic warfare detection and countermeasure system — the AN/SLQ-32.GD boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 4.2% from the prior-year reported figure.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Lockheed have rallied 4.4% against the industry’s 9.9% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankLockheed currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.33%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.3%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 1.92%.Coming into today, shares of the homebuilder had gained 8.52% in the past month. In that same time, the Construction sector gained 1.8%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 5.67%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from PulteGroup as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be April 25, 2023. In that report, analysts expect PulteGroup to post earnings of $1.78 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 2.73%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $3.27 billion, up 2.52% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $7.44 per share and revenue of $14.07 billion, which would represent changes of -31.11% and -13.29%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for PulteGroup. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. PulteGroup is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that PulteGroup has a Forward P/E ratio of 8.09 right now. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 8.62.Story continuesMeanwhile, PHM's PEG ratio is currently 0.51. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Building Products - Home Builders was holding an average PEG ratio of 0.7 at yesterday's closing price.The Building Products - Home Builders industry is part of the Construction sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 64, putting it in the top 26% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

(PHM) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-pultegroup-inc-130001516.html,1681736401,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this homebuilder have returned +8.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.7% change. The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, to which PulteGroup belongs, has gained 5.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $1.78 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.44 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -31.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.24 indicates a change of -2.7% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PulteGroup is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $3.27 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.5%. The $14.07 billion and $13.9 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -13.3% and -1.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $5.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.7%. EPS of $3.63 for the same period compares with $2.51 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +12.33%. The EPS surprise was +26.04%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They expect quarterly profits at S&amp;P 500 companies to decline 4.8% from the year-ago period, according to Refinitiv data on Friday, compared with a 5.2% decline forecast at the start of the earnings season.""While we are less concerned about Q1 results given subdued expectations and the fact that hard data in Q1 is still generally holding up, focus of investors will rather be on forward guidance,"" said Mathieu Racheter, head of equity strategy research at Julius Baer.Story continues""Current consensus estimates still point to a recovery in earnings growth and profit margins from Q3 onwards.

The bulk of that revenue came from immunology and cancer treatments. Those include long-standing top sellers like the blood cancer treatment Darzalex and Stelara, which treats psoriasis and other inflammatory disorders.Aside from prescription drugs, Johnson &amp; Johnson also sells medical devices, including products for knee and hip replacements. Sales in that segment grew more than 7% to $7.5 billion in the quarter.Chief Financial Officer Joe Wolk said surgical procedures “seem to have hit much more of a steady cadence” in the quarter as they climb back toward levels seen before the COVID-19 pandemic.The recent acquisition of cardiovascular technology company Abiomed also helped medical devices in the quarter.J&amp;J also has a consumer health business that sells well-known products like Band-Aids. Sales there grew about 7%. The company expects to spin that business off with an initial public offering by the end of this year.Overall U.S. sales grew nearly 10% to $12.52 billion in the quarter, while international sales climbed nearly 2%. Not counting the impact of currency rates, international sales grew over 8%.A strong U.S. dollar affects sales for companies with a lot of international business, and that has hit the top line of J&amp;J and other drugmakers over the past few quarters. Companies with international business convert those sales into dollars when they report earnings. The stronger dollar decreases the value of those sales.J&amp;J's adjusted earnings totaled $2.68 per share in the first quarter. That topped Wall Street projections for per-share earnings of $2.50, according to a survey by FactSet.Story continuesThe company also booked in the quarter a one-time charge tied to a proposal for settling lawsuits alleging that its baby powder containing talc causes cancer.The company said earlier this month that it would set aside nearly $9 billion, more than quadrupling the amount that the company had previously reserved to pay for its potential liability.J&amp;J pulled the baby powder from U.S. and Canadian store shelves a few years ago and is removing it from worldwide markets this year. The company isn’t admitting any wrongdoing as part of the proposed settlement.J&amp;J also said Tuesday that its board approved a 5% increase in the company's quarterly dividend. That bumps the payout up 6 cents to $1.19 per share.The New Brunswick, New Jersey, company also boosted the lower end of its forecasted range for 2023 by a dime.

CCI is scheduled to release first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 19 after the closing bell. Its quarterly results are likely to reflect year-over-year growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this Houston, TX-based real estate investment trust’s (REIT) adjusted FFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.09%. The growth in site-rental revenues due to elevated tower space demand aided the top line.Over the preceding four quarters, CCI’s FFO per share surpassed estimates on each occasion, the average being 1.66%. This is depicted in the graph below:Crown Castle Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCrown Castle Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCrown Castle Inc. price-eps-surprise | Crown Castle Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteThe advancement in mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G networks, and the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications have driven the growth in mobile data usage globally. Also, rampant usage of network-intensive applications for video conferencing and cloud services, and remote-working scenarios have fueled the rise.Crown Castle’s first-quarter earnings are likely to have benefited from the rise in capital spending by wireless carriers on the incremental demand from global 4G and 5G deployment efforts, growing wireless penetration and spectrum auctions.This phenomenon is expected to have driven tower leasing demand during the to-be-reported quarter, boosting Crown Castle’s top-line growth.Also, the company’s long-term lease agreements (typically five to 15 years) with the top United States carriers, having a strong credit profile, are anticipated to have aided its site rental revenues in the quarter.The consensus estimate for net revenues from site rentals is pegged at $1.61 billion for the quarter, indicating 2.2% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the same is $1.63 billion, implying an increase of 3.5% year over year.The consensus estimate for net revenues from the network services and other segment stands at $165.8 million for the first quarter, remaining flat year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.80 billion, indicating an increase of 3.4% from the year-ago reported number. Our estimate for the same stands at $1.79 billion, suggesting a rise of 2.9%.Further, CCI’s solid balance-sheet position is likely to have supported its small cell deployment efforts required to increase the capacity and density of the wireless network for 5G deployment.Nonetheless, the rationalization of a portion of Sprint's legacy network by T-Mobile, one of Crown Caste’s key customers, is anticipated to have cast a pall on the company’s quarterly performance. Management expects a majority of the non-renewals to take place during the first quarter. This is likely to have negatively impacted year-over-year billings growth in the quarter.Also, higher interest expenses are expected to have been a key headwind for the company during the to-be-reported quarter. We expect first-quarter 2023 interest expenses to rise 25.5% year over year.The company’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter were inadequate to garner analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has been unchanged at $1.95 over the past two months. Nonetheless, the figure suggests a 4.3% increase from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an FFO beat for Crown Castle this time.

The transaction will be carried out through a subsidiary of Merck.  Per the agreement, Merck will acquire all outstanding shares of Prometheus, subject to its shareholders’ approval.

Bloomberg said Taiwan was the buyer.The Pentagon declined to comment directly on the deal, but said: ""the United States makes available to Taiwan defense articles and services necessary to enable it to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.""In 2020, Taiwan said it planned to buy land-based Boeing-made Harpoon anti-ship missiles as part of its military modernization efforts.When asked about the news report, Taiwan Defence Ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fang told a regular media conference the ministry had previously disclosed information about the purchase, adding it was ""confident"" the deal would continue according to schedule.A contract with Boeing that the U.S. Naval Air Systems Command issued on Taiwan's behalf marks the first time it will get the mobile, land-launched version, the Bloomberg report said, citing Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the US-Taiwan Business Council.

They are leaning on bigger planes that can accommodate more passengers to get around operational challenges.Boeing's latest problem, identified last week, affects a portion of the 737 MAX family of airplanes, including the bestselling MAX 8.The MAX 737-8 planes tend to have higher seating capacity compared with jets of previous generations. The delays in their delivery will only compound airlines' operational headaches, said Addison Schonland, partner at consulting firm AirInsight.""The timing is awkward,"" Schonland said. ""You're going into the peak (travel) season. They need the bigger capacity.""While it is not deemed to be a safety of flight issue and in-service planes can continue to operate, aircraft will need to be fixed before delivery.The impact on airlines could be even more pronounced if the FAA mandates an emergency fix to in-service planes as opposed to allowing jets to be modified during scheduled maintenance, said Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard.Airlines are still scrambling to get all the details and assess the impact on delivery schedules.Boeing declined to comment on how many planes will be affected. CEO David Calhoun is expected to provide further details at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday.Bank of America analyst Ron Epstein, who estimated 690 MAX 8s have been produced since 2019, believes ""upwards of two-thirds"" could be impacted.Story continuesDELAYED RETIREMENTBoeing was scheduled to deliver 199 MAX planes to Southwest Airlines, United Airlines and American Airlines this year. Just 50 have been delivered so far.Data from ch-Aviation &amp; AirInsight Group shows the MAX-8 planes account for 7.6% of fleets at U.S. carriers. At Southwest, that rises to more than 21%.The Dallas-based carrier, aiming to increase capacity by at least 15% this year, had expected to receive 90 MAX planes in 2023. Boeing has delivered just 29.A Southwest spokesperson said Boeing's production issue will impact the airline's current delivery schedule, but added the company has no plans to adjust flight schedules.But Tom Nekouei, a vice president at the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, is not sure the company can operate its schedule. Since the low-cost carrier flies only 737s, its flight plans are the most vulnerable to Boeing's delivery delays, he said.Nekouei and some analysts expect Southwest to delay retirement of 27 older-generation Boeing 737-700 planes. Not only do those planes burn more fuel, they also have 18% fewer seats than MAX 8 jets at Southwest.That could mean higher operating costs and lower revenue for Southwest, which is recovering from a more than $1 billion hit due to an operational disruption around last Christmas.Jefferies analysts estimate each MAX plane is worth 0.1% of Southwest's capacity in the second half of 2023. The delivery delays could also dent its full-year profit by 3%.Boeing's production problem could also have implications for United, which is planning to increase capacity and has yet to receive nearly three-fourths of its MAX jet order this year.Last year, CEO Scott Kirby called Boeing's deliveries the biggest risk to the airline's capacity growth plans.While a United spokesperson said the company does not expect ""significant"" impact on 2023 capacity plans, Jefferies sees a 0.1% impact on second-half domestic capacity and a 2% hit on full-year profit.Unlike Southwest, United has a mixed fleet, which can be leveraged to offset the impact of delays in MAX deliveries.(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago and Valerie Insinna in Washington; Editing by Ben Klayman and Matthew Lewis)]"
132,b3abef49-78a5-30e7-818b-bfb19efc925a,BA,2023-04-18,Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun has charted a path back to profitability–but ongoing supply chain issues seem plane crazy,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-ceo-dave-calhoun-charted-152824946.html,1681745304,STORY,"['BA', 'SPR']","[With more supply chain woes at Boeing–this time, “fuselage” deficiencies from contractor Spirit AeroSystems–making the headlines days before Boeing’s annual meeting this week,  perhaps it is sane to wonder if it is just “plane crazy” that Boeing’s supply chain issues still flare up with alarming regularity four years after the highly publicized 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 passengers.More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home At the very least, this latest mess turns up the heat for CEO Dave Calhoun, who has absorbed relentless slings and arrows from all corners for problems that largely predate him or are outside his control, including misfires with regulators, COVID shutdowns, order cancellations, and high indebtedness. He deserves tremendous credit for charting a path back to profitability–without needing a single airplane purchase from China. In fact, just last year, we named Calhoun one of our five CEOs of the year, crediting him with finally guiding Boeing to take off after a long tarmac delay.However, the seemingly unending procession of quality control issues speaks to three specific challenges that are still plaguing Boeing’s supply chain and which threaten to derail Calhoun’s plans mid-flight.First, as supplier Spirit Aerosystems’ fuselage issue reminds us, Boeing’s supply chain diversification–or lack thereof–makes it unusually vulnerable to singular choke points. Boeing is basically solely dependent on Spirit Aerosystems as its outsourced aerostructure manufacturer. In fact, with Boeing represents a whopping 60% of Spirit’s revenues. This is over three times the dependence of Boeing’s competitors such as Airbus, which makes its own fuselages.Thus it is hardly surprising that minor problems at Spirit have boomeranged into at least three major Boeing production disruptions, with 787 halts in 2020 and 2021, and now the 737 disruptions this week. With Spirit’s outside analysts such as Bank of America ominously warning that “a significant ramp with a greener work force does not give the greatest comfort on execution,” the fact that Boeing has tried and failed for years to take control over this part of the supply chain casts its own strategic missteps in starker relief.Story continuesSpirit had been a part of Boeing since two years after its founding in 1927. Its core role for Boeing has been primary manufacturing of the entire fuselage of the Boeing 737, as well as its nose and forward-cabin sections of most Boeing plans and other parts. It was spun off by Boeing in 2005 to the Canadian private equity firm Onex, which took the company public just a year later, retaining 58% of ownership and 92% of the voting control!Some voices inside Boeing advocated for Boeing to purchase Spirit to provide direct oversight and capitalization–but senior executives have long reflexively shunned the acquisition, embarrassed by the idea of having to buy back a business, even though the cost would be relatively trivial with Spirit being only 2% of Boeing’s size.The asset-lightening move may have been intended as financial engineering to appease activist investors or to address the federal government’s concern over the concentration of defense-related businesses.  Whatever the reason, the outcome now appears to be regrettable. Increased oversight and integration, which would have followed such a purchase, would have provided Boeing with a similar advantage to that of Airbus. Additionally, once-promising partnerships with Spirit’s many competitors, such as Embraer, failed to take off due to self-inflicted wounds.Beyond the lack of supply chain diversification, persistent quality control problems continue to plague Boeing across its entire supply chain. Even though much criticism was levied at former leadership for “turbocharging Boeing’s production rates before the supply chain was ready, compromising quality,” Boeing continues to take billions in write-downs due to egregious cost overruns, while constantly postponing or canceling new product launches, ranging from the much-hyped jumbo 777X to new Air Force One jets, as the aerospace giant struggles to ramp up production and build capacity. Boeing’s customers have resorted to uncharacteristic public protests: One airline CEO compared Boeing execs to “headless chickens,” unable to deliver planes on time, while another lamented that Boeing “lost its way.”Calhoun has vowed to overcome supply chain challenges “eventually”–but also acknowledged frustration that it feels like a ""steady whack-a-mole kind of situation.""As the largest manufacturing exporter in the U.S. with a workforce of 130,000 employees, Boeing’s persistent quality and culture challenges, unfortunately, trickle down across its entire extended ecosystem of thousands of suppliers. And unlike four years ago, these quality control issues cannot be blamed on excessive profit growth (of which there has been none) or an unseemly focus on boosting the stock price (which has gone nowhere) amidst an aerospace down cycle.One cannot help but wonder about accountability across the Boeing supply chain, and why Boeing seemingly covered for its subcontractors instead of sharing the cost of the damage. For example, even though Collins Aerospace manufactured the faulty flight deck software which resulted in the 2018/2019 crashes, Boeing accepted full liability and sole responsibility for the 737 MAX crashes and paid a whopping $2.5 billion to settle criminal probes from the Department of Justice. Has Boeing become too deferential to its supplier base in their earnest efforts to fix relationships after years of relentless cost-cutting and pushing?The company must not be seen as having its head in the clouds and its planes on the ground. Ultimately, Calhoun has gotten the company back on track by getting its planes back up in the air–but the specter of persistent supply chain woes means more turbulence could be on the horizon.Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the Lester Crown Professor in Management Practice and Senior Associate Dean at Yale School of Management. Steven Tian is the director of research at the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute and former investment analyst at Rockefeller Capital.  The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.More must-read commentary published by Fortune:A recession in 2023 is now inevitable.

While not every stock performs well, when investors win, they can win big. Just think about the savvy investors who held Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) shares for the last five years, while they gained 396%. If that doesn't get you thinking about long term investing, we don't know what will. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 12% gain in the last three months.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Quanta Services To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Quanta Services achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 11% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 38% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 49.06.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Quanta Services' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Quanta Services the TSR over the last 5 years was 404%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Quanta Services shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 22% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, that falls short of the 38% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Quanta Services better, we need to consider many other factors.

The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC.Details of the DealValued at $63.3 million, the contract is expected to be completed by February 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will be engaged in full-rate production of SEWIP AN/SLQ-32(V)6 and AN/SLQ-32C(V)6 systems.A major part of the work related to this contract will be executed in Liverpool, NY.Importance of SEWIPThe rising threat of missile attacks has been fueling the demand for an effective electronic attack system that excels in defeating inbound threats.In this context, it is imperative to mention that Lockheed’s AN/SLQ-32C(V)6 or “SEWIP Lite” is part of the SEWIP product line. The system provides early detection, analysis, threat warning and protection from anti-ship missiles.SEWIP Lite is capable of both littoral and open ocean electronic surveillance. This system will be installed on fast frigate class and U.S. Coast Guard Offshore Patrol Cutters.Such advantages of the electronic warfare system make it an attractive option for the military, resulting in LMT winning orders for the same, like the latest one. The aforementioned developments, along with Lockheed’s more than 40 years of Integrated Electronic Warfare experience, are likely to boost the company’s revenue-generation prospects from the SEWIP electronic warfare system.Growth ProspectsCountries globally have been reinforcing their military resources due to intense geopolitical tensions and amplified terrorist threats. As a result, an effective electronic warfare system with anti-missile solution features is likely to witness a pent-up demand.Per a report from the Markets and Markets firm, the global electronic warfare system market is projected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2022-2027. Such growth prospects are likely to benefit Lockheed as its SEWIP product already holds a strong position in the aforementioned market.Story continuesThe abounding growth prospects should also benefit other defense majors who have forayed into the laser-based countermeasure system like Northrop Grumman NOC, L3Harris Technologies LHX and General Dynamics GD.Northrop Grumman’s SEWIP Block 3 is the third in a series of incremental upgrades that adds an electronic attack capability to the AN/SLQ-32 electronic warfare system to defend ships against anti-ship missiles.

Today's Featured Analyst ReportsNIKE shares have outperformed the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry over the past six months (+41.3% vs. +38.7%). The company gained from the Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, compelling product innovation and solid online show. NIKE witnessed double-digit revenue growth across North America, EMEA and APLA.For fiscal 2023, it expects revenue growth in the high-single digits, up from the prior mentioned mid-single-digit growth and in line with our estimate of 8.6% growth.However, NIKE witnessed decline in gross margin due to higher markdowns, increased freight and logistics costs, elevated input costs and currency headwinds.

The continued demand for vehicles and robust product lineup are set to fuel sales volumes of Toyota. The Zacks analyst expect total vehicle sales to increase around 7% year over year in fiscal 2023 to 8.8 million units.To capitalize on the accelerated global shift to green cars, the auto giant is deepening focus on manufacturing electric and fuel-cell vehicles, which will bolster the company’s product competitiveness. Toyota is also committed to returning capital to shareholders via buybacks and dividends, which sparks confidence.However, commodity cost inflation is expected to weigh on gross margins. Unfavorable foreign currency translations and high R&amp;D expenses are also likely to limit profits. We expect net income in fiscal 2023 to decline 18.6% year over year.

During his 27-year career at Nike, he held various executive positions of increasing responsibility, including EVP of global product and merchandising from 2008 to 2013 and EVP and GM of global footwear from 2001 to 2008. Prior to joining Nike, Sprunk was a certified public accountant at Price Water House Coopers.After his retirement from Nike in 2020, Sprunk has gone on to join the boards of several companies such as aviation leader Bombardier, UN refugee agency USA for UNHCR and General Mills, according to his LinkedIn page.Late last month, Sprunk was part of a group of investors that raised $3 million in a round of funding for Hilos, which uses 3D printed technology to avoid overproduction waste in footwear.This move comes just days after Nordstrom named Jason Morris as its new chief technology and information officer.

Judging from the commentary by the airline's top execs, consumers have already plunked down a pretty penny to take a vacation or two this summer.Then there is specialty apparel retailer Express (EXPR), which plunked down $75 million a week ago in partnership with WHP Global to buy Bonobos from Walmart.It's hard to imagine Express CEO Tim Baxter, a veteran merchant and frequent guest on Yahoo Finance Live, would sign off on that type of transformational deal if he thought a recession was going to rip through the crucial back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons.That's the positive. Now to the negatives — and there are a lot of them.A person shops in a supermarket as inflation affected consumer prices in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., June 10, 2022. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly (Andrew Kelly / reuters)The latest retail sales report was straight-up bad — no punches pulled.Appliance sales were under pressure. Sales at general merchandise stores were under pressure. Department store sales were under pressure. Taken together, the retail sales report shouted loudly that the consumer is under increasing stress.""People are being cautious,"" Levi's long-time CFO Harmit Singh said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). The jeans maker called out a hearty increase in its inventory levels year on year, in part due to consumers shopping more conservatively.Buried inside the earnings reports of JPMorgan (JPM), Citi (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) are more moderate paces of growth in debit and credit card spending. Results in big-ticket categories such as autos and housing were soft at the nation's biggest banks too.Story continuesWells Fargo CFO Mike Santomassimo told me on a media call that ""given the pace of rate increases, we see some slowing in the economy happening.""That vibe was felt in the poor results out of auto retailer CarMax (KMX) last week as well.You can also see these spending concerns being baked into the stock prices of well-known consumer companies.Shares of Macy's (M), Dollar General (DG), Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF), and Nike (NKE) have all underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the past three months, according to Yahoo Finance data. Macy's has felt the largest drop, falling 23% in three months' time.“The problem for many investors right now is that it’s still possible to construct fairly divergent narratives about the economy depending on which series you look at,"" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid explained in a client note. ""On the one hand, an array of leading indicators are pointing to a U.S. recession over the coming year. For instance, yield curves have inverted, temporary jobs are declining, and on previous occasions when the Fed have hiked this fast and this quickly, a recession has followed shortly afterwards.""""But if you wanted to take the opposite view,"" Reid added, ""you could point to unemployment around its lowest in decades, a high level of vacancies by historic standards, financial markets that have mostly shrugged off the SVB-related turmoil by now, along with growing signs that inflation is softening and the Fed are nearing a pause in their rate hikes.”Mixed signals, no doubt.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the Q1 earnings season, in addition to new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NIKE, Inc.

Total earnings for these 33 index members are up +7.7% from the same period last year on +10.1% higher revenues, with 81.8% beating EPS estimates and 69.7% beating revenue estimates. On the earnings front, this is a better showing from this group of 33 index members than we have seen from the group in the last three reporting cycles, in terms of growth as well as the beats percentages. With respect to revenues, the growth pace for this group of 33 index members is better than what we saw in the preceding period while the beats percentage is in-line with what we saw from the group in the 2022 Q4 reporting cycle. Looking at Q1 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-companies, total earnings are expected to be down -9.5% from the same period last year on +1.8% higher revenues.

Today's Featured Analyst ReportsNIKE shares have outperformed the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry over the past six months (+41.3% vs. +38.7%). The company gained from the Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, compelling product innovation and solid online show. NIKE witnessed double-digit revenue growth across North America, EMEA and APLA.For fiscal 2023, it expects revenue growth in the high-single digits, up from the prior mentioned mid-single-digit growth and in line with our estimate of 8.6% growth.However, NIKE witnessed decline in gross margin due to higher markdowns, increased freight and logistics costs, elevated input costs and currency headwinds. Also, elevated SG&amp;A expenses are concerning.(You can read the full research report on NIKE here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Toyota Motor have gained +1.3% over the past six months against the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry’s gain of +8.8%. The continued demand for vehicles and robust product lineup are set to fuel sales volumes of Toyota. The Zacks analyst expect total vehicle sales to increase around 7% year over year in fiscal 2023 to 8.8 million units.To capitalize on the accelerated global shift to green cars, the auto giant is deepening focus on manufacturing electric and fuel-cell vehicles, which will bolster the company’s product competitiveness. Toyota is also committed to returning capital to shareholders via buybacks and dividends, which sparks confidence.However, commodity cost inflation is expected to weigh on gross margins. Unfavorable foreign currency translations and high R&amp;D expenses are also likely to limit profits. We expect net income in fiscal 2023 to decline 18.6% year over year. Thus, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.(You can read the full research report on Toyota Motor here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of ConocoPhillips have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry over the past year (+10.3% vs. +6.7%). The company holds a bulk of acres in the unconventional plays of Eagle Ford shale, Permian Basin and Bakken shale. Significant opportunities are there for the company in the Bakken Shale, where it owns about 750 undrilled locations that could provide access to huge reserves.ConocoPhillips projects its 2023 production at 1.76-1.8 MMBoe/d, suggesting an increase from 1.74 MMBoe/d last year. COP’s balance sheet is significantly less leveraged than the industry it belongs to. Additionally, the company announced its 2023 planned return of capital to shareholders of $11 billion.However, ConocoPhillips is highly exposed to oil price fluctuations, which makes things challenging for the company. Also, the company been generating lower dividend yield than the industry for the past few years. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on ConocoPhillips here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Automatic Data Processing, Inc.

This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home The dot-com bubble was bursting and a generation of tech workers were being spat out from the up-and-coming industry as collateral damage.It’s why when Wong got his first engineering role at PayPal, he “just felt lucky to get a job”.In fact, it was the only decent offer he had.At the time, he had no idea it would go on to become the big break that would lead to joining Facebook in its early days, taking on the CEO role at Reddit and now founding his own climate venture, Terraformation.“It turns out, being at PayPal at that time was very important,” he tells Fortune as we dive into his résumé to find the roles, experiences and bosses that have shaped him into the CEO he is today.Burger King, front of house1995 - 1996I mopped the dining room, cleaned the bathroom and took down orders… At the time, Burger King still had a pretty manual old-style 80s register that didn’t calculate the change for you. I became extraordinarily fast at doing calculations. My supervisor was always impressed that at the end of the shift, my drawer never had errors in it.I learned that wherever you are, just try to do a really good job and you’ll stand out.The Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, Research2000-2001I learned a lot from this job because my boss had around 40 years of experience on me. He got his PhD in computer science before I was even born.The top piece of advice I've always remembered from him is that anytime you have a range of options, imagine them on a line graph. Never pick the option in the middle, always pick one of the two extremes because then you get extreme benefits.Story continuesI used this way of thinking in 2020 when I decided to make my current company 100% remote.Now that people are going back into offices, our whole company is never going to able to be in one office. But we get the extreme benefit of being able to source talent from anywhere in the world.PayPal, Senior engineering manager2001 - 2005After PayPal had been bought out by eBay it underwent a reorganization. It was then, that I had my ‘worst boss’.Some people have these hell bosses, right? It wasn't that kind of experience. He was just incompetent and ineffective, and because most of my bosses prior had been so good he stood out.My advice in that situation is that you can't let it bother you because it'll just eat you up. You’ve just got to do your thing. But it really reinforced how valuable good leadership is.Facebook, Engineering director2005 - 2010I joined Facebook because out of all the companies I interviewed at, it had an atmosphere similar to early PayPal.I actually asked to be interviewed by Mark Zuckerberg because I wanted to figure out what kind of founder he was going to be. At the time the company had around 20 workers so that was still possible—and very interesting.Zuckerberg didn't care at all about business or money, and he really didn’t sell out to VCs. All he cared about was that we make a really good product for the users.He once said to me, there are all these things that you think that you need to be. But leadership is not something that you have to find, it’s inside of you.It was weird because this guy was younger than me. He still couldn’t drink. But until that point, I did think “I need to like gain these skills, or learn these things, or be older” a lot.To some point that’s true, yet many of the personal qualities that you need to be a leader come from inside of you.Sunfire, co-founder2010 - 2012When I left Facebook, the startup economy was just starting to bounce back from the 2008 crash.A friend of mine and I needed a place to like work on our independent projects, but back then co-working spaces didn't exist.So we created this little invite-only co-working space for our talented friends from Facebook and Google who were also between jobs.Here's the funny thing. If we hadn't been so Asian about it, we would have been WeWork before there was WeWork.The landlord wanted us to sign a 10-year lease, but we only wanted a one-year lease because we had raised all the money up-front. Each year as demand increased, so did rent.We could have kept raising money to match the rent, but it seemed like too much money to ask of our backers for the same service. So we shut the business down.However, if we had just signed the 10-year lease at $2 a square foot, we could have sublet the office space entirely when rent skyrocketed to $15 a square foot. So Sunfire could have been WeWork, but maybe we dodged a bullet...Square, Consultant2011 - 2012While at Square I gave out a piece of advice to engineering managers which has apparently now been repeated all over Silicon Valley which is ‘hope is not a strategy’.Strategy is where you say, the following three things can happen, these are the possible outcomes and I have a strategy for all of them, that will get me to where I want to go.Saying ‘we're gonna do this, and then hope this happens’—as the engineers did that day—is not a strategy.”Reddit, CEO2012 - 2014If you read the history of ‘Reddit under Yishan’ it says that the user base increased fivefold, and that we were able to cut costs and get technical costs down to avoid bankruptcy.So it sounds like a success. But I felt like it had been a failure. Getting burned out and quitting felt like a setback.Before I left, I raised a bunch of money for the company, and that fundraising was so depleting that I didn't have as much in me to continue.I was only around 34 years old and didn't know how much being a CEO involves management of your own energy and psychology.For a while after, I would second-guess myself, like, ""what if I had made this decision differently?"" Until I realized: whoa if I made this decision differently, I would still be there—and I don't actually want to still be there.If that hadn't happened, other things (like founding Terraformation) wouldn't have happened and my successors have done a very good job of running Reddit.So regrets are genuinely not useful and control is an illusion—make the best of whatever situation you're in.Terraformation, Founder and CEO2020 - presentI have found that people who don't like to be told what to do, don't like to tell other people what to do. As it turns out, I'm one of those people and that can cause a problem as a leader because sometimes people need to be told what to do.I learned that too late to correct a bunch of errors that I'd made while at Reddit. But it's one of the things that I've stayed conscious of in this position.Workers don't want to be micromanaged, but you have got to be willing to give them some direction.If you just say the goal is x a very small number of people can take that and then formulate an entire strategy.Usually, people need to hear the goal is x and the way we're going to achieve it, is by doing a, b, and c.I still err a little bit too much on the side of not setting those expectations enough. But I try to be conscious of knowing when people need specific guidance and direction.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

161,9e103d1e-de31-337a-98d3-4797dbf709b1,IBM,2023-04-18,Siemens and IBM collaborate to accelerate sustainable product development and operations,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/siemens-ibm-collaborate-accelerate-sustainable-100000593.html,1681812000,STORY,"['SIE.DE', 'IBM']","[The two companies are developing a new systems engineering and asset management combined software solution to support traceability and sustainable product development – linking domains including mechanical, electronics, electrical and software engineeringPLANO, Texas, April 18, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Siemens Digital Industries Software and IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced they are expanding their long-term partnership by collaborating to develop a combined software solution integrating their respective offerings for systems engineering, service lifecycle management and asset management.Siemens and IBM collaborate to accelerate sustainable product development and operationsIncreasing competitive pressures, tight labor markets and growing environmental compliance objectives require organizations to adopt a more holistic management approach that spans the product and asset lifecycle. The companies will develop a combined software solution to help organizations optimize product lifecycles, and make it easier to improve traceability across processes, prototype and test concepts much earlier in development, and adopt more sustainable product designs. The goal is to help organizations speed innovation and time to market which can lead to improved quality and lowered costs.The new combined SysML v1 standards-based suite of integrated engineering software is expected to support traceability and sustainable product development using a digital thread that links mechanical, electronics, electrical engineering and software design and implementation. It is intended to span the product lifecycle, from early design and manufacturing to operations, maintenance, update and end of life management. Initially, the companies are working to connect IBM Engineering System Design Rhapsody for systems engineering with solutions from the Siemens Xcelerator portfolio of software and services including Siemens' Teamcenter® software for Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) and Capital™ software for electrical/electronic (E/E) systems development and software implementation. The companies have also connected the IBM Maximo Application Suite for asset management with Siemens' Teamcenter software to support an integrated digital thread between service engineering, asset management and services execution.Story continuesThese integrations will focus on the effective reuse of processes and materials to allow traceability for sustainable product development. This can help companies to make informed decisions earlier in the design and engineering process to help drive improvements in cost, performance and sustainability. For example, companies can more quickly identify under-performing components or design elements that consume excessive amounts of power, or require maintenance or early replacement, and product innovation can be driven through an integrated digital thread that connects the physical and software assets back into product development.""A significant portion of product innovation and differentiation contains electrical, electronics and software components. Yet, manufacturing companies are struggling to bring new products to market on time, as the current tools, processes, and information to manage these components are siloed and disconnected,"" said Kareem Yusuf Ph.D, Senior Vice President, Product Management and Growth, IBM Software. ""To address this gap, IBM and Siemens are collaborating on a digital thread environment to integrate sustainability practices throughout the lifecycle of a product, from design, production, operation, maintenance and beyond. This connectivity will help enable quicker time to innovation and compliance preparedness, and overall improved product quality.""Siemens and IBM are also collaborating to create a SysML v2 based solution with a migration path to help customers transition to next generation systems engineering. SysML supports the specification, analysis, design, verification and validation of a broad range of systems and systems-of-systems. Service lifecycle management can assist in maximizing business value for product servitization by connecting service engineering to service maintenance to facilitate new collaborative processes between OEM and operators.""Together, Siemens and IBM will deliver a simulation-driven systems and software engineering solution that is designed to cover the full operational lifecycle. This can empower our customers to innovate by helping to reduce product development costs, drive continuous improvement and create operational efficiencies across the extended enterprise throughout the product's operation lifecycle,"" said Tony Hemmelgarn, President and Chief Executive Officer, Siemens Digital Industries Software. ""We are developing this to help companies truly shift left by improving extensibility and reuse of systems models and associated data with standards-based solutions in an open ecosystem and to enable our customers to develop better products.""Kamil Mrva, Chief Information Officer at ŠKODA Group and early adopter of the service lifecycle and asset management solution, said: ""We are working very closely together with Siemens and IBM to help us to reach our sustainability goals, reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) of products for our customers and support our business transformation with an increased focus on services.""Siemens will be supported by benefits through IBM's newly launched Partner Plus program and will offer the solution as part of the Siemens Xcelerator ecosystem.Siemens Digital Industries Software helps organizations of all sizes digitally transform using software, hardware and services from the Siemens Xcelerator business platform.

Let's take a sector-by-sector look. Here with more, Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith. Hey, Brad.BRAD SMITH: Hey, Rochelle. Great to see you here. As we kick off another trading weekend, you know what that means? Yes, the earnings season rolls. Of course, we had some of the big banks plus Delta Airlines and a little bit of a shock drop from American Airlines last week. But now this week, we're zeroing in on a few big names here. I've got the NASDAQ 100 pulled up as one of the themes is going to be the early tech trade, and particularly some of those Dow components.Now, IBM is going to be one of those companies that we're going to be watching for later on this week. As of right now, kicks off this week down by about 2/10 of a percent. But one of those other big names is going to be Netflix as well. That one, of course, within the NASDAQ 100. And for Netflix, we're actually be looking for revenue to come in at about $8.18 billion with EPS coming in at $2.89.That's some of the expectations, some of the key themes, of course, to keep a close eye on as the company has already started to enact some of the cost mechanisms for themselves as it comes to pricing tiers not just on the advertising model side but then also cracking down on password sharing and account sharing. So with that in mind, keep a close eye on some of those subscriber numbers as well as how much they continue to spend.Another company that we're going to be keeping an eye on within tech-- Tesla here. And we're taking a look at shares there. You're seeing those down by about 1%. Year to date coming into this report, you're seeing it lower-- or excuse me-- higher 50% year to date. And then additionally, it's important to keep in mind two big themes for this company.Story continuesOne of them is going to be not only EV demand but at what price here, because that is where they have really kicked off this pricing war within the electric vehicle landscape, and then additionally on the front of Tesla and Elon Musk, what they have to signal about that profitability on the back of some of the deliveries, the production figures that they've been able to already announce over the course of the first quarter in 2023.The expectations there, just briefly-- $23.43-- we'll round it off-- $2 billion is what they're expected to see in revenue based on consensus estimates from Bloomberg. And then additionally, EPS, that expected to come in about $0.86 a share for Tesla, which would represent a move higher on the EPS front by about 2% year over year. Also going to be keeping close tabs on the banking sector as well here, which I know you're going to be talking a little bit more about.But just a preview, Bank of America-- we're going to have a little bit more of a deep dive on this later on this week-- that's actually expected to see two big themes to really pull through for it. Look for retail. Look for the health of the consumer. Of course, as we've gotten even more of that commentary about the health of the consumer and the resilience of consumer accounts, we've already started to see that come through from companies like JPMorgan.But in this particular case, what makes Bank of America that much more important is it being perhaps the largest consumer-facing type of bank. And so with that in mind, continue to keep an eye on Bank of America shares. The expectations there-- it's actually for an EPS growth year over year of about 2% and for revenue to come in at $25.32 billion with EPS earnings per share coming in at about $0.81. I can't read my chicken scratch on my own notes, but about $0.81, $0.82 on an adjusted basis there.And then lastly, I'll just leave you with Procter &amp; Gamble, of course, one of the components that we're going to be tracking closely as we move on throughout the rest of this week here. But PG here on the day-- you're seeing that up by about 2/10 of a percent. Year to date, it's down by 2/10 of a percent, though, and so we'll see exactly what the company has to say around pricing for some of those consumer goods, where they're still seeing volumes move through.That's going to be a key word to perhaps Command-F or Control-F within the earnings report when that comes through. And then additionally, on the supply chain management, there's this larger talk about if there is-- or determining, rather-- inflation versus what some have called greedflation, even. And some of the prices continuing to remain higher though some of the largest impacts of the supply chain that have impacted prices in the past have mitigated themselves. So it'll be interesting to see where some of that risk has abated, at least for Procter &amp; Gamble, and how that sets the tone for some of the other CPG companies out there, Rochelle.- A really interesting look at how all these indicators will add up as we look at the health of the economy and the health overall that we'll see with earnings season. Great stuff there for us. Our very own Brad Smith.]"

We've also got a lot of housing data that's out in the coming days. And we're going to hear more comments from the Fed here. But Sozzy, if there are a few things as we continue to move forward over the course of this week that we should be paying close attention to, one of the huge things that I'm going to be watching is, even as we're taking a look at some of those companies and the logos corresponding up here on screen, is really kind of kicking off some of that tech talk here, the first read on the tech trade amid this earnings season, and then for additionally what we were seeing--And I was going to point to one of the logos a moment ago. But we've got IBM on the tech front. That's really-- thank you so much-- one of the AI OGs, if you will, as much talk as there is about artificial intelligence and where that can be woven into some of the stories that each company is telling in terms of their own growth narrative, that's going to be interesting to see what IBM has to say, of course, given the fact that they launched Watson I think back when I was in middle school or high school.So that considered, you're also going to have Netflix. They've got some password sharing and the subscriber counts that are going to come into focus there. And then lastly on the tech front, of course, Tesla with some of the price cuts, and even on the production and delivery numbers that we did see come through for the first quarter. Going to be a larger question of, what kind of tone they strike with regard to those price cuts and if there could be more in the future if they're able to maintain profitability. And investors are certainly going to be watching for the maintenance of that and the retention of that profitability as well.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: No, that's great insight, Brad. And I'm going to refrain. It's so hard for me not to provide a little nugget on each. But I don't want to throw just chaos into this stuff. I can't. I can't. I'm going to start with, real quick though, P&amp;G, I'm very interested.We've seen a lot of talk about inflation coming down. But prices at the likes of Target and Walmart for a lot of the stuff that P&amp;G sells, like shave care, expensive. Schlumberger, very interesting to me as well, as OPEC following those OPEC cuts. Curious what that company has to say.But overall, Brad, let's-- it's not it's important, I think, to remember, let's Zoom out and keep in mind what you overall should be looking for this earnings season because you can very easily get lost in minutia for some of these results. How is moderating inflation impacting the financial statements? How does guidance look for a lot of these companies? Are companies still laying people off?And then lastly, are companies-- how are they spending their cash in this environment? If we are going into recession, are they investing in capex? Are they raising their dividends? Are they buying back stocks? All things we should be watching for.BRAD SMITH: And it's interesting, the health of the consumer that we've heard about from the big banks, as they kicked off the earnings season, that could start to continue to show up, or at least continue to show up rather, in the United and American Airlines. Their reports that are set to drop this week as well, worth watching after we had seen Delta Report last week. And of course, it was a miss on both the top and bottom lines.However, it was really the guidance that they were providing going forward. So a larger question of if some of those larger travel trends are set to really continue to move or at least be a tailwind for companies in the United and American Airlines. And we'll see what kind of tenor they strike this week too.BRIAN SOZZI: All right one more for you, Taiwan Semi--BRAD SMITH: There we go.BRIAN SOZZI: TSMC, very important off that Samsung warning a few weeks ago, and Micron, name to watch.]"

(PRNewsfoto/IBM)The study* reveals that surveyed executives point to inadequate data (41%) as the biggest obstacle to their ESG progress, followed by regulatory barriers (39%), inconsistent standards (37%) and inadequate skills (36%). Without the ability to access, analyze and understand ESG data, companies struggle to deliver greater transparency to the consumer – a key stakeholder – and meet consumer expectations.Seventy-four percent of surveyed executives believe that stakeholders understand their organizations' ESG objectives and performance, yet only about 4 in 10 surveyed consumers feel they have enough data to make environmentally sustainable purchasing (41%) or employment (37%) decisions.""Consumer commitment to environmental sustainability and social responsibility has intensified with consumers voting with their wallets,"" said Jonathan Wright, Global Managing Partner Sustainability Services and Global Business Transformation, IBM Consulting. ""As a majority of consumers choose to buy from and work for ESG leaders, businesses must prioritize transparency and break down barriers to ESG data.""Other study findings include:Companies are investing in ESG and see it as good for business76% of surveyed executives say ESG is central to their business strategy.Almost 3 in 4 surveyed executives (72%) view ESG as a revenue enabler rather than cost center, suggesting that contrary to popular opinion, ESG and profitability are not at odds.76% of executive respondents agree or strongly agree that their organization focuses on achieving ESG outcomes, not just reporting requirements.Story continuesConsumer commitment to sustainability has intensified, but consumers don't feel they have sufficient information to make informed choicesRoughly two-thirds of surveyed consumers say environmental sustainability (68%) and social responsibility (65%) are very or extremely important to them.Executives admit their companies haven't made significant progress toward ESG goals, indicating data challenges impact their ability to measure progress and meet consumer demands 95% of surveyed executives say their organizations have developed ESG propositions; however, only 10% say that their organizations have made significant progress against them.Almost 3 in 4 surveyed executives (73%) say their organizations struggle to manage an overload of manual data, while 7 in 10 say they have difficulty consolidating or manipulating data.The study highlights ESG leaders, a sub-set of respondents with greater maturity in operationalizing ESG, who are seeing higher revenue, improved profitability, deeper customer engagement by approaching ESG as a transparency play that creates strategic business opportunities. These role models provide a roadmap for organizations looking to overcome data-related challenges and create sustainable change that includes: automating ESG processes and reporting capabilities to keep data current; tapping AI for enhanced insights into performance, forward looking analysis, and scenario development; aligning with ecosystem partners on ESG metric definitions and standards; and proactively establishing ESG data governance principles with stakeholders.""Data is the lifeblood of ESG. Now is the time for enterprises to act. By operationalizing ESG plans, enterprises are putting information in the hands of operators who can make informed business decisions that can improve their ESG impact on a daily basis,"" said Wright. ""Organizations looking to increase stakeholder support and meet ESG reporting requirements should implement a sustainability roadmap that is inclusive of technologies, services and ecosystem partners that can position them for greater business success and help them address regulatory compliance,"" said Wright.To view the full study, visit: https://ibm.co/esg-ultimatum*Study MethodologyThe IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) surveyed 2,500 executives from across 22 industries and 34 countries, delving into their organizations' ESG strategy, approach, and operationalization; what benefits they expect from ESG initiatives; and how they weigh ESG against other business objectives.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company value investors might notice is CVR Energy (CVI). CVI is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as an A grade for Value.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. CVI has a P/S ratio of 0.27. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.28.Finally, investors will want to recognize that CVI has a P/CF ratio of 4.01. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 4.39. Over the past year, CVI's P/CF has been as high as 9.88 and as low as 3.79, with a median of 5.28.Marathon Petroleum (MPC) may be another strong Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing stock to add to your shortlist. MPC is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value grade of A.Story continuesMarathon Petroleum is currently trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 7.22 while its PEG ratio sits at 0.25. Both of the company's metrics compare favorably to its industry's average P/E of 6.19 and average PEG ratio of 0.72.Over the last 12 months, MPC's P/E has been as high as 14.22, as low as 4.42, with a median of 7.23, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.20, as low as 0.19, with a median of 0.30.Furthermore, Marathon Petroleum holds a P/B ratio of 1.69 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 1.30. MPC's P/B has been as high as 2.03, as low as 1.21, with a median of 1.62 over the past 12 months.These are just a handful of the figures considered in CVR Energy and Marathon Petroleum's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that CVI and MPC is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

169,69386a6d-8450-3131-9f02-6a43ae57831e,MPC,2023-04-18,Wall Street Analysts Think Marathon Petroleum (MPC) Is a Good Investment: Is It?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-think-marathon-133001016.html,1681738201,STORY,['MPC'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Marathon Petroleum (MPC) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Marathon Petroleum currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.47, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.47 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 73.3% and 6.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MPCBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MPCCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Marathon Petroleum here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Marathon Petroleum, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is MPC Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Marathon Petroleum, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.6% over the past month to $20.59.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Marathon Petroleum. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Marathon Petroleum may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 81 cents per share on revenues of $1.3 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the provider of hydraulic fracturing and other auxiliary services to onshore exploration and production companies in North America in the March quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at LBRT’s previous-quarter performance first.Highlights of Q4 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the Denver, CO-based oilfield service company beat the consensus mark due to the impact of strong execution and increased service pricing, which more than offset weather and holiday-related effects. LBRT had reported earnings per share of 82 cents, 11 cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues of $1.2 billion generated by the firm also came in 2.6% above the Zacks Consensus Estimate.LBRT beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, which resulted in an earnings surprise of 81.5%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Liberty Energy Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseLiberty Energy Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseLiberty Energy Inc. price-eps-surprise | Liberty Energy Inc. Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter bottom line has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 2,800% jump year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 59.1% increase from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderDespite growing risk in financial markets due to the aggressive monetary tightening by central banks, Liberty management believes that the energy market remains tight, with China emerging out of its stifling zero-COVID policy and rising global demand for air travel. On top of this, the OPEC+ supply cut, sanctions on Russian oil and limited availability of spare production capacity are likely to further strengthen the demand for North American energy.This means upstream operators (particularly in North America) are drilling more wells to increase output that has remained depressed over the past two years due to the lack of investment, supply-chain issues, scarcity of labor and equipment attrition. With domestic oil and natural gas output set to reach new highs, the existing fracking capacity seems inadequate to cater to this demand uptick. In this context, Liberty management sees elevated demand for its next-generation fleet that supports clients’ requirements for quality and reliability.The abovementioned factors should buoy LBRT’s first-quarter revenues and cash flows.On a somewhat bearish note, the increase in LBRT’s costs might have dented the company’s to-be-reported bottom line. The company’s fourth-quarter total operating expenses totaled $1 billion, up 37.5% from the year-ago period. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter due to the prevailing inflationary environment.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that LBRT is likely to beat estimates in the first quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates. But that’s not the case here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, for this company is -11.48%.Zacks Rank: Liberty currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Liberty, here are some firms from the energy space that you may want to consider on the basis of our model:Marathon Petroleum MPC has an Earnings ESP of +9.16% and a Zacks Rank #2.

To qualify, automakers had to provide information proving that at least 50% of their battery components and 40% of their critical minerals are sourced from the US or its trade partners.Ford F-150 LightningThose cars include the Cadillac LYRIQ, Chevrolet Blazer, Chevrolet Bolt, Chevrolet Bolt EUV, Chevrolet Equinox, Chevrolet Silverado, Chrysler Pacifica PHEV (plug-in hybrid EV), Ford F-150 Lightning, Lincoln Aviator Grand Touring PHEV, Tesla Model 3 Performance, and Tesla Model Y.Excluding the Chevy Blazer, Equinox, and Silverado — which aren’t on sale yet — there are only eight vehicles available for the full tax credit. Going even further, if the Pacifica PHEV and Aviator PHEV are excluded from the list since they are hybrids, there are only six pure EVs on sale in the U.S. that qualify for the full tax credit.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Popular vehicles like the Nissan Leaf, Rivian R1T, and Volkswagen ID.4 crossover no longer qualify for the EV tax credit after not meeting requirements. The changes to the EV tax credit qualifications go into effect on Tuesday, April 18th.“This isn’t a surprise and what I meant when I said March would go down as the high-water mark for EV tax credit eligibility since the passage of the IRA,” John Bozzella of the industry trade group Alliance for Automotive Innovation told Yahoo Finance, referring to when the IRA’s battery requirements were not in effect. “Customer affordability is a key condition for a successful EV transition (along with charging, critical mineral availability and utility capacity), so that’s why we’ve been focused on making the 30D incentive as broadly available to as many customers and on as many EVs as possible.”The Tesla Model Y SUVWith only six models (or nameplates) available for the full-tax credit on sale today, Bozzella and other industry experts fear the nation’s transition to EVs may be hampered by the unavailability of the full tax credit.Story continuesThat being said, a number of vehicles are receiving partial EV credits due to the Treasury’s formula for determining battery component sourcing and critical mineral usage. Fifty percent of battery components must be produced or assembled in North America to qualify for $3,750, and 40% of critical minerals must be sourced from the US or a free trade partner for the other half.Notable vehicles receiving half the credit include the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Escape PHEV, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Wrangler PHEVs, and the Tesla Model 3 RWD. If partial credits are included, a total of 17 different nameplates qualify for the full or partial credit.The good news for consumers and the automakers is this list isn’t set in stone.“Keep in mind: the IRS guidance isn’t frozen in time,” AAI’s Bozzella said. “The content thresholds will ramp up in the coming years. The IRS list of qualifying vehicles could also change over time (both up and down) as supply chains localize and our country partners with allies on mineral agreements – something that is well underway.”—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

GM would customize the touch-screen interface with GM's own branded look and features.The software will be able to collect data on the vehicle's electric charge and tire pressure and make suggestions, including adding a suggested route to Google Maps for drivers who want to use the hands-free Super Cruise assisted driving system. GM said CarPlay and Android Auto could not offer such services.GM looks to launch its new display-screen software on the Chevrolet Blazer electric SUV, set to go on sale this summer. The automaker will continue offering CarPlay and Android Auto on its gas- and diesel-engine vehicles and a few EVs.Reportedly, the plan to reach more deeply into the vehicle's controls was a factor in GM's decision to ditch CarPlay on future models.Price Action: GM shares traded higher by 0.32% at $34.60 premarket on the last check Monday.Photo via Wikimedia CommonsStory continuesDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Better-than-expected results in the past week from bellwethers like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C) calmed the market to a large extent, but there is still reason for caution.Yahoo Finance spoke to several banking experts who gave their assessment on the current environment. American Banker’s John Heltman says it’s too early to call the crisis over before we see quarterly results from more mid-size regional banks. Quant Insight Head of Analytics Huw Roberts says he feels the crisis is largely contained and credits the Fed for restoring order. ‘I think you have to give credit to the Fed and other authorities for the speed at which they moved,’ he said.Key video moments:00:00:13 banking crisis 'feels contained'00:00:40 why deposits are 'leaving the system'00:00:55 moving from crisis to stabilization phaseVideo TranscriptINES FERRE: Is the banking crisis over?HUW ROBERTS: I hope so. It does feel like it's largely contained. And although they have their detractors, I think you have to give credit to the Fed and other authorities for the speed at which they moved. I think maybe the debate now has probably moved on to the extent that we're seeing the big bank, kind of small regional bank divide open up. And that's what this week's earnings will be so critical on.BEN LAIDLER: We're not saying there's a banking crisis, but we have lived through a scare. So I think deposits are leaving the system. They're being attracted into money market funds by the 5% rates that are on offer versus the sub 1% you get at your bank. That predates SVB and the recent banking scare. So I think that's going to continue.MICHAEL ROSE: We think we are moving from the crisis phase to the stabilization phase. And I think as we move into earnings season, what we're going to see is trends that we expected to envelop as the banking crisis did play out, which is deposits, deposits, deposits, meaning flows, deposit flows, deposit costs, and the mix of deposits, changing from those that are non-interest bearing to interest bearing.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you think the crisis is over, or this might flare up again over the summer?JOHN HELTMAN: I think it's too early to say with any definitive knowledge.

So this is a problem that regulators are going to have to grapple with sooner or later, to figure out how to even the playing field between money market funds and banks and bank deposits, to figure out how to stem that tide.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock.

However, supply-chain disruptions are headwinds.Factors Favoring CSXCSX’s top line is benefiting from higher export coal volumes, domestic intermodal shipments, volume growth in other segments and pricing gains. Evidently, coal revenues increased 36% in 2022 driven by strength in export coal. High export coal prices and fuel surcharge revenues are expected to bolster the top line in the near term.CSX’s commitment to reward its shareholders is encouraging. In February 2023 the company announced a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to 11cents per share. In 2022, CSX rewarded shareholders roughly $5,583 million through buybacks ($4,731 million) and dividends ($852 million). In 2021, the company returned more than $3.7 billion to shareholders through buybacks ($2.9 billion) and dividends (over $800 million).Key RiskCSX’s operations are being hurt by supply-chain disturbances, including labor and equipment shortages. Weakness in Merchandise due to semiconductor shortage is concerning. Revenues from Intermodal (internationally) are expected to be affected at least in the near-term due to headwinds like inflationary pressures.

Sullivan, was elected to the Board. Since that time, we have grown increasingly concerned about the Company’s continued failure to act with urgency in exploring ways to maximize value for shareholders, especially in light of Aimco continuing to trade at a deep discount to its own stated net asset value (NAV). While we note the recent appointment of Sherry L. Rexroad to the Board following the resignation of Terry Considine, we believe more action is needed.At this point, the path forward is clear to us. Aimco must run a full public strategic review process to evaluate all potential alternatives – including a sale – to deliver value for shareholders. It is our understanding that Morgan Stanley has been retained by the Company and we encourage the Board to make full use of this resource.In our view, there is at present still capital available in the financing markets for a transaction such as this. Additionally, the Company has attractive assumable debt in place and government-sponsored entities are continuing to lend to support workforce housing, which makes the Company an even more attractive asset.Story continuesWe are aware of multiple well-financed and interested parties who would likely jump at the chance to engage in transaction discussions with Aimco. While you have encouraged us to send any viable bidders your way, very few of these interested parties will engage in serious discussions without being invited first. And it’s not possible to know the true depth of the buyer pool and the pricing level of a potential transaction without a proactive process. Based on our analysis, we believe a potential sale could result in between 40% and 60% upside to the current trading price.We encourage and expect the Board to act with urgency. The economic environment is still on sound footing and the capital markets remain open for a potential transaction, but either of those variables could change rapidly. We will continue to advocate for the best interests of all shareholders and look forward to a clear update on the status and specifics of the ongoing review of a ""broad range of options"" to enhance value.Sincerely,Jonathan LittLand &amp; Buildings Investment Management, LLCView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230418005466/en/ContactsMediaLongacre Square PartnersDan Zaccheidzacchei@longacresquare.com]"

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks To Buy Now.""Semiconductors Are Showing Really Terrific Leadership""On April 11 Bill Baruch, president and COO of Blue Creek Capital Management, appeared in an interview on TD Ameritrade Network where he discussed the current trends in the semiconductor industry and his outlook for semiconductor stocks. Baruch thinks that inflation is cooling down and this bodes well for equity markets.Baruch further spoke about the tech rally we have experienced so far. He talked about some of the recent gains of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and noted that ""semiconductors are showing really terrific leadership"". Baruch noted that the focus of semiconductor stocks was not the weakness in PC demand, but instead it was Samsung's (KSE:005930) recently announced production cut. On April 7, Samsung (KSE:005930) announced that it is cutting memory chip output after the company's Q1 2023 operating profit fell to $455.5 million, the lowest since the global financial crisis. Samsung (KSE:005930) believes that cutting memory chip production by a ""meaningful"" level will help it restore the supply-demand imbalance within semiconductors and survive a potential downturn. Here are some comments from Bill Baruch:""The Samsung (KSE:005930) news of cutting chip production was the focus of semiconductors and not the slowing PC demand, and I think that's because PC demand has been known to be slowing. That's a lagging number for quarter 1. Let's look ahead, when you see the inventory cycles of the semiconductors, and we're getting out of the worst of it. The focus isn't right here right now, it's the 2024, and that is really becoming a tailwind to semiconductors who wrote down those expectations in the middle of last year. Again, it's a market of have and have-nots. The stocks that have written down those expectations and the companies that have not. We're starting to see this focus into the 2024 numbers, and my reason to bring that up is that it gives the market (semiconductor market) leadership here.""Story continuesThough ""having the leadership within the market is extremely important"", Bill Baruch noted that it has to be coupled with inflation coming down since inflation remains the Fed's top priority. As inflation cools down, the Fed can stop its hiking cycle and this will create a positive environment for semiconductors and the tech space.Heading into 2024, Bill Baruch expects semiconductor stocks to lead the market as inflation cools down and the Fed stops tightening. In the current market environment, many semiconductor stocks have bottomed and are currently trading at attractive valuations. We have compiled a list of the best undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy now according to hedge funds.

Some started arriving as early as 5:30 a.m., eager to safely dispose of the unwanted items they'd been storing.Over 950 cars showed up at the event toting automotive batteries, light bulbs, scrap metals, electronics, used tires and more. JEP's Community Recycling Day is a sister event to the Cummins Columbus Engine Plant (CEP) Recycling Day that took place on September 15th. Between the two events, an estimated 140 tons of unwanted items were collected and diverted from landfills.A look back at JEP Recycling Day 2022 NumbersThe JEP event alone brought in:2,526 gallons of paint4,275 pounds of automotive batteries1,297 pounds of other types of batteries734 pounds of light bulbs3,160 pounds of scrap metal66,844 pounds of electronics950 gallons of used oil65,820 pounds of used tiresThe steady rise of electronic wasteThe growing popularity of handheld devices like cellphones, tablets and smartwatches has contributed to a vast amount of electronic waste, also known as e-waste globally. E-waste can be broken into six categories: lamps, small IT and telecom equipment, monitors/screens, temperature exchange equipment, large equipment and small equipment.E-waste is one of the fastest-growing waste streams in the world, with over 50 million tons generated per year. Of those 50 million tons, only 17% is reported as properly recycled.Cummins plants have implemented systems to reduce this waste. Community recycling days, however, help limit the number of discarded items, including e-waste, that end up at landfills and incinerators, while energizing communities around a common environmental cause. The event shows people how their individual actions can make a greater impact.Waste reduction a JEP and CumminsAt JEP, recycling days are just one aspect of an overall waste reduction culture. JEP is one of Cummins' zero-landfill sites - sites that reuse or recycle all materials in a useful way.Story continuesAs part of the Planet 2050 Strategy, Cummins aims to achieve a 25% reduction in waste by the year 2030, with longer-term aspirations for 2050. This includes a reduction in packaging waste, process waste and general trash.Cummins plans to do this by recycling used oils, batteries, e-waste, cardboard, steel and other materials. They also are forming partnerships with organizations like the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), and plan to transition away from single-use packaging and toward reusable plastic packaging.Jamestown Engine Plant's Community Recycling Day 2023This year, Jamestown Engine Plant will host their Community Recycling Day on Saturday, June 10.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cummins-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cummins Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/749637/Cummins-Removed-Tons-of-Waste-Including-E-waste-From-Jamestown-New-York-Community-in-2022]"

Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.Story continuesDarren J. KingThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity position as well as the impact of our merger with People's United Bank. Compared to last year's first quarter, revenues have grown over $970 million or 67%, translating into 24% positive operating leverage year-over-year. Pre-provision net revenues have more than doubled since last year to $1.1 billion. Credit remained solid with net charge-offs still below our long-term average. Capital levels remained strong with the CET1 ratio estimated to end the first quarter at 10.15%. During the quarter, we repurchased $600 million in common shares which represented 2% of our outstanding common stock, and the Board approved an 8% or $0.10 per share increase in the quarterly common dividend to $1.30 per share. Tangible common equity per share increased 3% to $88.81 per share. In addition, April 1 marked the 1-year anniversary of the closing of the People's United acquisition. We're pleased with the results of the largest acquisition in our company's history. The tangible book value dilution was only 4% and has been earned back already. Merger costs were less than anticipated at the time of announcement. Targeted expense synergies have largely been realized and are now in the run rate. As a result of these -- the above, the return on investment and EPS accretion have exceeded those expected at the time the deal was announced. Let's take a look at the first quarter results. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $4.01 for the first quarter of 2023, down 7% compared with $4.29 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net income for the quarter was $702 million, 8% lower than the $765 million in the linked quarter. On a GAAP basis, M&amp;T's first quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.4% and an annualized rate of return on average common equity of 11.74%. This compares with rates of 1.53% and 12.59%, respectively, in the previous quarter. Included in GAAP results were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $13 million in the first quarter and $14 million in the sequential quarter, representing $0.08 per common share in both quarters. Pretax merger-related expenses of $45 million related to the People's United acquisition were included in the fourth quarter's GAAP results. These merger-related charges translate to $33 million after tax or $0.20 per common share. There were no merger-related expenses in this year's first quarter. In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results including tangible assets in equity. Consistent with our long-term practice, M&amp;T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions. We believe this information provides investors with a better picture of the long-term earnings power of the institution. M&amp;T's net operating income for the first quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, was $715 million, down 12% from the $812 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $4.09 for the recent quarter compared with $4.57 in 2022's fourth quarter. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.49% and 19% in the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.7% and 21.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022. As a reminder, GAAP and net operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 were impacted by certain noteworthy events. This included a $136 million gain related to the sale of the M&amp;T Insurance Agency as well as a $135 million contribution to M&amp;T's Charitable Foundation. These items collectively netted and did not materially impact net income. Next, we'll take a deeper dive into the underlying trends that generated our first quarter results. Taxable net interest income was $1.83 billion for the first quarter of 2023, slightly below the linked quarter. The $9 million decrease was driven largely by a $30 million in lower net interest income, reflecting the 2-day shorter calendar quarter, partially offset by a $13 million positive impact from our hedging program and $8 million from higher average earning asset volumes net of higher average interest-bearing liability volumes. The net interest margin for the past quarter was 4.04%, down 2 basis points from the 4.06% in the linked quarter. The primary driver of the decrease to the margin was the impact from a higher level of borrowing, which we estimate reduced the margin by 19 basis points. This was partially offset by the impact from higher rates on earning assets, net of deposit funding, which we estimate added 18 basis points. All other factors had a negligible impact on the margin. Total average loans and leases were $132 billion during the quarter, up $2.6 billion or 2% compared to the linked quarter. Looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared to the fourth quarter, commercial and industrial loans and leases increased $2.4 billion or 6% to $42.4 billion with $1.9 billion being broadly based and $453 million of growth in average dealer Floor Plan balances. During the first quarter, average commercial real estate loans decreased by $363 million or 1% to $45.3 billion. The decline was driven largely by lower permanent mortgages as average construction loan balances were essentially flat. Residential real estate loans increased by $435 million or about 2% to $23.8 billion due largely to the timing of the retention of originations throughout the prior quarter. End-of-period balances were essentially flat sequentially. Average consumer loans were up $144 million or about 1% to $20.5 billion. Recreational finance loan growth continues to be the main driver of increased balances and these average loans grew $178 million or 2%. Average earning assets, excluding interest-bearing cash on deposit at the Federal Reserve increased $4.9 billion or 3% and due to the $2.6 billion growth in average loans and $2.3 billion increase in average investment securities. Although average interest-bearing cash balances have decreased $777 million to $24.3 billion during the first quarter of this year, they came in higher than our initial projections. The sequential quarterly decline in cash reflects loan growth and the drop in deposit balances, partially offset by the proceeds from long-term borrowings issued during the quarter. Consistent with our expectations and normal seasonal outflows, deposits declined sequentially. However, the $1.9 billion or 1% sequential average decline was slightly better than our expectations at the January earnings call. We remain focused on growing and retaining deposits. Our experience in prior rising rate environments reminds us to expect increased competition for deposits and changing customer behavior, leading to a mix shift within the deposit base. During the first quarter, average demand deposits declined $8.4 billion. Savings and interest-bearing checking deposits increased $1 billion and time deposits increased $5.4 billion. Average commercial deposits declined a net $2.4 billion as business owners shifted $6.3 billion out of operating demand deposit accounts and into both on and off balance sheet sweep accounts to earn a higher return on their excess balances as well as to make distributions. Almost 2/3 of the decline in noninterest-bearing deposits was offset by movement into on-balance sheet sweep accounts where those average balances increased $3.8 billion during the first quarter of 2023. Turning to consumer deposits. They declined a net $758 million in the first quarter as $2.5 billion in outflows were partially offset by a $1.7 billion increase in average time deposits. Lower levels of activity in the capital markets and seasonal factors also impacted average balances for the following lines of business. Trust fund demand balances declined $1.2 billion. Municipal deposits declined $789 million and escrow deposits declined $684 million. Average brokered CDs increased $3.8 billion sequentially due almost entirely from growth during the previous quarter. Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $587 million in the first quarter compared with $682 million in the linked quarter. M&amp;T normally receives an annual distribution from the Bayview Lending Group during the first quarter of the year. This distribution was $20 million in 2023 and $30 million in last year's first quarter. As noted earlier, the fourth quarter of last year included a $136 million gain from the sale of the M&amp;T Insurance Agency. Excluding these 2 items, noninterest income was up $21 million or 4% sequentially. Trust income of $194 million in the recent quarter was flat sequentially. Service charges on deposit accounts were $114 million compared with $106 million in the fourth quarter. The increase primarily reflects a full quarter of service charges on acquired customer deposit accounts after these fees were waived in October and November of last year. Mortgage banking revenues were $85 million in the recent quarter, up 4% from the linked quarter. Revenues from our residential mortgage business were $55 million in the first quarter compared with $54 million in the prior quarter. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $30 million in the first quarter compared to $28 million in the final quarter of 2022. Other revenue from operations excluding the distribution from Bayview Lending Group in this year's first quarter and the gain from the sale of the M&amp;T Insurance Agency in the sequential quarter were $140 million, up $9 million sequentially. Turning to expenses. Operating expenses, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and merger-related expenses, were $134 billion in the first quarter of this year, little changed from the fourth quarter of last year. As is typical for M&amp;T's first quarter results, operating expenses for the recent quarter included approximately (inaudible) of seasonally higher compensation costs relating to accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirement-eligible employees. The HSA contribution, the impact of annual incentive compensation payouts on the 401(k) match and FICA payments as well as the annual reset in FICA payments and unemployment insurance. Those same items amounted to an increase in salaries and benefits of approximately $74 million in last year's first quarter.As usual, we expect those seasonal factors to decline significantly as we enter the second quarter. Excluding the charitable donation in the fourth quarter of last year and the seasonally higher compensation in the first quarter, operating expenses increased $32 million sequentially. The increase was due largely to $15 million in higher compensation and benefits costs, largely related to higher headcount in the first quarter, $6 million in higher FDIC insurance expense, reflecting a higher assessment rate for the industry, $4 million in higher advertising and marketing expenses and $5 million in professional services expenses directly attributable to the pending sale of M&amp;T's collective investment trust business. Given the prospect for slowing revenue growth, we remain focused on diligently managing expenses and continuing to generate positive operating leverage. The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was 55.5% in the recent quarter, compared with 53.3% in 2022's fourth quarter and 64.9% in the first quarter of last year. Next, let's turn to credit. The allowance for credit losses amounted to $1.98 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $50 million from the end of the linked quarter. In the first quarter, we recorded a $120 million provision for credit losses compared to $90 million in the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs were $70 million in the first quarter compared to $40 million in last year's fourth quarter. The reserve build was largely due to a combination of loan growth and the anticipation of declining values for office and health care properties partially offset by improved expectations for hotel, retail and multifamily property prices. At the end of the first quarter, nonaccrual loans were $2.6 billion, an increase of $118 million compared to the prior quarter and that represented 1.92% of loans, up 7 basis points sequentially. As noted, net charge-offs for the recent quarter amounted to $70 million including amounts that reflect updated appraisals of nonaccrual office loans. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 22 basis points for the first quarter compared to 12 basis points in the fourth quarter. Loans 90 days past due, on which we continue to accrue interest, were $407 million at the end of the recent quarter compared to $491 million sequentially. In total, 75% of these 90-day past due loans were guaranteed by government-related entities. Turning to capital. M&amp;T's common equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 10.15% compared with 10.4% at the end of the fourth quarter. The decrease was due in part to growth in risk-weighted assets and the impact of the repurchase of $600 million in common shares, which represented 2% of our outstanding common stock. Tangible common equity totaled $14.7 billion, up slightly from the end of the prior quarter. Tangible common equity per share amounted to $88.81 per share, up 3% from the end of the year. Turning to the outlook. As we look forward to the rest of this year, we believe we are well positioned to navigate through the challenging economic conditions. However, the rapidly changing interest rate expectations combined with continued pressure on funding affect our outlook for the full year of 2023. As a reminder, the acquisition of People's United closed on April 1, 2022, and thus the outlook for 2023 includes 4 quarters of operations and balances from the acquired company compared to only 3 quarters during 2022. Our 2023 outlook also reflects the sale of the M&amp;T Insurance Agency that closed in October of last year. And even though the sale of the Collective Investment Trust business is expected to close in the first half of this year, our outlook includes the full year of operations from this business. First, let's talk about net interest income outlook. The outlook for interest rates in the economy continues to change frequently. Since March 8, the 10-year U.S. government bond yield has dropped 46 basis points and the forward curve has changed meaningfully as well. We expect taxable net interest income to grow in the 20% to 23% range when compared to the $5.86 billion during 2022. This range reflects different rates of deposit balance growth, deposit pricing and loan growth. Consistent with the current forward curve, our forecast incorporates [2 25] basis point cuts in the final quarter of this year. As we noted on the first quarter call, a key driver of net interest income in 2023 will be the ability to efficiently fund earning asset growth. We expect continued intense competition for deposits in the face of industry-wide outflows. Full year average total deposit balances are expected to be down low single digits compared to the $158.5 billion average during 2022. During the first quarter, we issued $3.5 billion in senior debt and we'll utilize the combination of FHLB funding and senior debt over the course of this year as needed to ensure that we can continue to meet the loan demands of our customers. We continue to expect the deposit mix to shift toward higher cost deposits with declines expected in demand deposits and growth in time and on balance sheet suite. This is expected to translate to a through-the-cycle interest-bearing deposit beta in the high 30% to low 40% range. Taking all of these factors into account, we anticipate the net interest margin to be slightly below 4% for the full year of 2023 and to continue to migrate towards the long-term range we have been discussing for the past couple of quarters. Next, let's discuss the drivers of earning asset growth. We currently plan to grow the securities portfolio by $2 billion compared to the $28 billion balance at the end of March of this year with the addition of longer duration mortgage-backed securities throughout the year. Looking at average loans, we expect average loan and lease balances during 2023 to grow in the 10% to 12% range when compared to the 2022 full year average of $119.3 billion. We anticipate growth to continue in the second quarter and then for average balances to be flat to slightly down over the second half of the year. This implies total average loan and lease balances in the fourth quarter of 2023 to be up 1% to 3% from the $129.4 billion average during the fourth quarter of 2022. The mix of C&amp;I, CRE and consumer loans, inclusive of consumer real estate, is almost 1/3 each as of the end of March. We expect this trend to shift slightly as C&amp;I growth outpaces CRE. As we have seen over the past 3 quarters, higher levels of interest rates are expected to slow down the growth in our consumer loan book in 2023. After these average loans grew 2% in the first quarter, we expect the indirect portfolio to be relatively flat over the remainder of the year. Turning to fees. Excluding the $136 million gain on the sale of the M&amp;T Insurance Agency in the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as securities losses, net interest income -- sorry, noninterest income was $2.23 billion in 2022. We expect 2023 noninterest income growth to be in the 7% to 9% range compared to the $2.23 billion in 2022. This outlook for noninterest income includes the impact of a bulk purchase of residential mortgage servicing rights that we completed at the end of this year's first quarter. Turning to expenses. We anticipate expenses, excluding merger-related costs, the charitable contribution and intangible amortization to be up 11% to 13% when compared to the $4.52 billion during 2022. Recall that approximately half of this increase reflects an extra quarter of People's United expenses. In addition, this outlook for net operating expenses includes the impact of the previously noted mortgage servicing rights purchase. We do not anticipate incurring any material merger-related costs in 2023 and intangible amortization is expected to be in the $60 million to $65 million range during 2023. Turning to credit. We expect credit losses to migrate towards M&amp;T's long-term average of 33 basis points, although the quarterly cadence could be lumpy. Provision expense over the year will follow the CECL methodology and will be affected by changes in the macroeconomic outlook as well as loan balances. For 2023, we expect the taxable equivalent tax rate to be in the 25% range. Finally, turning to capital. M&amp;T's common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.15% at March 31, 2023, comfortably exceeds the required regulatory minimum threshold, which takes into account our stress capital buffer or SCB. We believe the current level of core capital exceeds that needed to safely run the company and to support lending in our communities. We plan to return excess capital to shareholders at a measured pace over the long term. However, in the near term, we plan to maintain a CET1 ratio slightly above the current level until the current economic uncertainty abates. With that, let's open up the call to questions before which Shelby will briefly review the instructions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America.Ebrahim Huseini PoonawalaI guess I just wanted to go back to the deposit beta and the NII guidance. So high 30s to low 40s deposit beta, if you can unpack that a little bit in terms of how has your view around deposit pricing behavior change today relative to January? And that could be because Fed fund is at 5%, events of the last 1 month post SVB. Just give us a flavor of commercial versus retail? Are you seeing differences? And has one changed a lot more than the other? Would appreciate any color there.Darren J. KingSure, Ebrahim. The deposit betas are largely moving consistent with how we thought they would. When we think about the cumulative through-the-cycle beta, we really haven't changed our thought process there. What happens is kind of from quarter-to-quarter, you might see the pace at which we get from where we are today to that terminal cumulative beta shifts a little bit, depending on the competition. And obviously, the first quarter, there was a lot of disruption going on in the market. But generally, the most elastic deposits are the commercial and the wealth deposits. And when we look underneath the hood there, we see that the betas of the commercial deposits are in kind of the mid-60s to low 70s and that will be higher in commercial. If we add in small business, that comes down a little bit because those deposits tend to be a little bit less price sensitive.And then when you get in the consumer space, you're in kind of the mid-teens deposit beta so far. And with that number, that includes the impact of time deposits. If we didn't include the impact of time deposits on those consumer deposit betas, they'd be pretty low. But we tend to include the time when we think about the beta because we see time for consumers as a substitute product in rising rates for money market savings and savings accounts. And so we try to think about the all-in funding cost, which includes time deposits, which is why we include those. And so when we look at the quarter and we look at the decline, for me, a couple of things kind of jump out. First is that the decline in deposits this first quarter versus last year's first quarter are almost identical. And so given that last year was kind of a more normal year and this year had a lot of activity going on for those numbers to be about the same when you look at as at, that gave us a lot of -- we felt really good about that.And the other thing is just a little bit about -- there's a normal seasonal decline that happens in the first quarter as commercial customers tend to make their distributions to principles to pay taxes. But underneath the surface, it's important to keep in mind that there are a couple of things that affected deposit flows for us this quarter. One was Trust demand balances were down about $1.2 billion, right? So a 20% of those balances were Trust demand balances which move with economic activity and another $700 million odd was escrow. And with mortgage rates moving, there's less activity and so a little bit less action in the escrow accounts. And so outside of that, I see it as a very typical seasonal decline in commercial balances, offset by folks moving -- commercial folks in particular moving some of their balances into on-balance sheet sweep or interest-bearing. So we kind of look at those two categories together as one. And when rates go down, we see deposits flow into noninterest-bearing. And when rates go up, there's a different mix of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing, but nothing that we're seeing that's outside of our history, our expectations. So hopefully, that said a lot gives you a little color.Ebrahim Huseini PoonawalaNo, it was a lot. And just on a separate question, I think you mentioned you provided some -- made some reserves against office CRE. Obviously, a lot of focus there. Give us a perspective of, is there a pool within your office CRE book that you view or within the CRE book at higher risk? And how do you frame the loss content if some of these buildings end up in foreclosure and you have to have a distressed sale around that? Is it easy to handicap that right now? And just your thought process in managing that portfolio?Darren J. KingSure. Office, obviously, is getting a lot of attention in the world, and we've been focused on it for quite some time. When we go through it and we look at what we think the loss content is, it's a little bit tricky to estimate right now only because there hasn't been a lot of asset sales. I think in talking to our team prior to the call, they suggested that there were 4 properties that sold nationwide outside of Manhattan and 3 in Manhattan in the first quarter. So that's not a lot of activity to get a market price. So everything that's happening is everyone's looking at cash flows and NOIs.And so when you think about the cash flows, as we think about our clients. It's -- one of the things that's really important to keep in mind is about 2/3 of our clients in real estate in general have put on fixed -- floating to fix swaps on their loans. And so the impact of the interest rate increases hasn't really affected their ability to carry the loan. And then we started looking at what's coming due. And so you worry about maturities and the ability to -- for folks to refi and the pace at which those loans might come due. And so when I look forward -- when we look forward into the next couple of quarters, in aggregate, we have about $200 million of office maturing each quarter for the next 2. And then it actually drops down in the fourth quarter.And when we look at the LTVs of what's maturing, we're in the neighborhood of 80% of those maturing loans have an LTV of 60% or less. And again, it's important to keep in mind that not all of those LTVs are calculated off of brand new appraisals. Some of them are -- will be a little bit dated, but when you look at some of the protections in place, there's a bunch of room there. So that's not to suggest that there will be no losses. As you could see in our results for the quarter, we did take some partial charge-offs on a couple of office properties as we did get new appraisals on things that were troubled. But there is still room there. And I think for us, we keep looking at what's the pace at which the loans are maturing. And I think what you'll see, certainly for M&amp;T and I would expect, although I don't know other people's portfolios, that the office story is one that will play itself out over multiple quarters, if not multiple years because of the maturities, because of the fact that most people will hedge if they got a floating rate note. And a lot of the leases are still not maturing because office leases tend to be longer dated than residential. When we look at our office leases, the number -- something in the neighborhood of 75% don't come due until after 2024. So lots -- I guess, the long-winded way of saying it's a concern, we're watching it. It's -- our portfolio is pretty broadly spread across our footprint. And it will play itself out over the next several quarters.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley.Manan GosaliaJust on the deposit side, it's not surprising that deposits ended the quarter below the average. Can you talk a little bit about the trajectory of deposits in the second half of March? How much -- I guess how much the deposit balances change through -- from [Feb 28] through the impact from SVB through quarter end and even if you have what's been happening quarter-to-date this quarter.Darren J. KingSure. I guess I would just caution on drawing cause and effect that the numbers are the numbers, but whether the decline that happened in March was specifically attributable to the [SCB] or signature challenges is difficult to say just because there's normal activity that happens in the first quarter, right? As we mentioned, the Trust demand balances move based on capital markets, not in -- on activity, not necessarily because of an exogenous event. But roughly, when you look at the decline in total deposits over the quarter was about 60% happen before March and 40% happened in March. So a little bit heavier March, but as you get into that March time frame, that's when we got our distribution from Bayview, which is when distributions often get paid right in front of taxes, for commercial clients.And so when we look at the effect on the bank of the changes that happen, what we tended to see was we opened up more accounts in our business and middle market space than we would typically in a month. And we saw balances come on to our balance sheet as people sought to diversify. And there were some cases where that went the other way. But net-net, we were flat to slightly up from what our expectations were, given all the activity that was happening in the marketplace. So from our perspective, we were in line with what we thought for the quarter and pleased with how the client base and our teams reacted to everything that was going on in the world in the month of March.Manan GosaliaGot it. And I guess, how confident are you at this stage that deposit balances have stabilized and to the extent -- we noticed that the SCB is essentially doubled on a Q-on-Q basis. So how confident are you that, A, the deposit balances have stabilized? And then B, given that you've kept your deposit beta assumptions, what would cause you to increase your deposit rates as we went through the middle of the year. And maybe if you have it, what were your spot deposit rates as of March 31.Darren J. KingI'll start with. I don't have the spot deposit rates in front of me, and we can follow up with that. But in terms of the stability of deposits, again, keep in mind that it's the action that we're seeing right now is really in noninterest-bearing, and that's really being driven by commercial deposits. When we look at consumer balances outside of some outflow in January and when I say that, I mean noninterest-bearing, they've been relatively stable through February and March. And when you look in the consumer space, what you're seeing is a shift between interest-bearing categories. And so we're seeing movement from savings and money market into time, which is pretty typical during rising rates. And the net is some small outflow in DDA, which again is pretty standard in the first quarter of the year.In the commercial space, outside of the normal seasonal activity, what will happen is deposits, noninterest-bearing deposits will start to stabilize as customers get down to the level of deposits they need to keep in their operational accounts to make payroll, to pay accounts payable and the like and excess will not necessarily leave the balance sheet. It will just shift into some form of interest-bearing. It could be interest checking or it could be an on-balance sheet sweep. And so there will be some decline, and there always is for M&amp;T in these environments. When we look through the past, we see that when rates have gone down to 0, we tend to have an increase of about 4 or 5 percentage points in the percentage of our deposit base that sits in noninterest-bearing. As rates rise, that goes back the other direction. And that's just exactly what we're seeing now and what's happening.And so over time, if you go -- went all the way back into pre-global financial crisis for banks, not just for M&amp;T but for the industry, noninterest-bearing deposits were in the kind of 20% range of total deposits. And they peaked at 45% for us and about 30% for the industry. And so depending -- and that was the last time Fed funds was anywhere near the rates that they are today. On the flip side, time deposits were a huge percentage of total deposits in the industry in that time period, upwards of 25% or 30% and they've come all the way down into the 5% -- to 10% range.I give you that as context to say that what's going to happen, what we think will happen is you'll continue to see some outflow of deposits but it will stabilize as rates start to stop increasing. And what you'll see is less movement out and more movement across categories. And again, for consumers, we think that will be from interest products like money market and savings into time. And for commercial customers, it will be from noninterest-bearing DDA into interest-bearing things like sweep and commercial checking. And so for us, for the rest of the year, we think things start to stabilize as we get into the second quarter and second half and the build back in commercial checking balances will start in anticipation of next year's first quarter. It's a cycle that it follows itself very predictably every year.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from John Pancari with Evercore.John G. PancariI want to see if you can give us a little more color on the updated loan growth guidance, the 10% to 12%. Where are you seeing some of the better trends coming from because it looks like it was upwardly revised from where you had expected it coming out of last quarter?Darren J. KingYes. So John, keep in mind that, that 10% to 12% includes 4 quarters of People's this year and the average is 3 quarters last year, right? So some of that is in there. I think we noted in the outlook that if you look based on the average balances in just the fourth quarter of last year, we're more in the 1% to 3% range. And if you look at that, a lot of that's happened already in the first quarter. And based on where the first quarter loan balances ended, just the averaging effect of that should carry a little bit of growth through the second quarter. And then we expect things to kind of flatten out a little bit as we go through the back half of the year. And that's how you -- that's just the math that gets the average into that range.And really, the -- I think the challenge that you're seeing is pipelines have been robust, but they're starting to slow down a little bit, and we're managing them to focus our liquidity on our best customers and our relationship customers. And then in some instances, in some of the consumer space as it is indirect and recfi with rates going up, you're seeing a little less demand from the clients and therefore, a little bit of a slowdown that will keep balances flat to slightly down in that space just as the duration of that portfolio is pretty short. And so you need to continue to originate new to keep it flat or to grow it.Within the commercial world, there's not a lot of activity that's really happening in CRE. There's not a lot of new construction. And so what we would expect is you see for us and for the industry, as loans mature a lot of capital and liquidity is devoted to those clients and keeping them around. And then in the C&amp;I space, we've seen a fairly broad-based growth, whether it's by geography or by industry type. We did note that the dealer floor plan balances have grown. They're still maybe half of their long-term average, which is better than they were but there's some upside there. And obviously, you get a slowdown in indirect, you likely see an uptick in the dealer Floor Plan balances. But those are kind of the spaces where we're seeing activity and how we expect the rest of the year to play itself out.John G. PancariGot it. All right. And then just secondly, back to the office portfolio, just a few things around that. What percentage of the office book is criticized? I believe last quarter, you indicated about 20% of it was criticized? And in that 60% LTV that you mentioned for what is maturing coming up, do you have some granularity on what the refreshed LTVs look like as part of that. And then lastly, did you add to the commercial real estate reserve this quarter?Darren J. KingOkay. A lot in there. Let me try and make sure I get it all. So the office criticized it's still right around 20%. It's up slightly, but not up dramatically. And the hotel criticized continues to come down. So it's important to keep that in mind because as we talk about the CRE increase that you're asking about, there's an offset within the whole CRE allowance, right? We've seen some improvement in hotel and retail, offset by some decline in office. But we did add to the CRE allowance in the quarter. If you think about dollar amount, it's probably half to 2/3 of the $50 million provision was allocated towards the net -- towards the CRE portfolio. The rest would be driven by growth in other portfolios.When you look at the LTVs, what we've seen in the ones that we have updated so far is we're seeing somewhere between a 15% and 20% decline in some of the updated values of the properties that we've reappraised. And so that's why you didn't hear me talk much about 80% or 70% LTVs because those ones are getting closer perhaps to where these properties might reappraise, but 60% LTVs and [sub-50%] LTVs would seem to still have a lot of cushion before you're into any material loss content. And so when we look at that we feel good about where we are. It doesn't mean that we're taking our eye off the ball, but we feel good about where we are. And again, just to give a little more color on New York City office, next quarter -- this quarter we're in right now, there's 5 loans that are maturing with a principal balance of $30 million.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Dave Rochester with Compass Point.David Patrick RochesterOn capital, the buyback going forward, it sounds like you're pretty much saying no buyback for 2Q? Or is that too strong a statement? Or is the thought just that you'll wait to get your CCAR results and then hope that the market is more stable at that point and go from there?Darren J. KingYes. I think that is Zero is a strong statement. When we look through the quarter and what we see with the pace of risk-weighted asset growth, we see the potential actually for kind of a trifecta and that we should see a little bit of risk-weighted asset growth. As rates are rising and liquidity is constrained, we think that we'll start to see some increased margin and profitability of new lending activity, which usually happens at this point in the cycle. So we'll deploy capital to those opportunities first. We will -- and we do anticipate closing the sale of the CIT business in this quarter, which will create a gain, which will help with our capital ratios, which should allow us to be in the market and repurchase some shares. And at the same time, maintain this kind of capital level that gives us a really nice cushion given the uncertainty in the market and while we wait for the SCB. From our perspective, if we run a little light for a quarter, it doesn't mean that the capital is gone. It just means it comes back a little bit later in the year. But we think we're in a position here which is nice where we can actually do all 3. We can grow risk-weighted assets. We can return capital and we can grow the capital ratios all at the same time.David Patrick RochesterGot it. Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned your outlook on hotel, retail and multifamily properties improved. I was just wondering if you could unpack that a little bit and just talk about what you're seeing that drives that improved outlook there. And then, you had mentioned, I guess, office properties at the -- as you kind of redoing these LTVs are coming down, maybe 15% to 20%, if I heard that right. Is that how much you're actually marking these as well? So the NPAs that you have in the market that you took this quarter, is that roughly the magnitude? Or is it less just given that 15% to 20% really doesn't cut into a lot of those properties if those LTVs (inaudible) that well?Darren J. KingSure. Yes. I can't write fast enough to keep up with all the questions that you got. So if I missed one, just let me know. So in hotel and retail, hotel, in particular, we saw that portfolio peak, it's kind of 80% criticized back in the pandemic. And what you're seeing is the return to travel, a lot of capacity that came out of the system during those times and occupancy rates and RevPAR is really strong. And so the NOIs on hotels are really strong, and that's why you're seeing those come out of criticized and the asset value they're holding up.Multifamily also continues to be strong. I did not make a comment about multifamily values, but multifamily has been very strong. When you look at rent increases over the last 24 months, they've been very strong. And in fact, rents in multifamily appreciated faster than interest rates did. And so they should be well covered to handle moving interest rates. And retail, kind of played itself out largely through the pandemic. And as the economy opened up, we've typically seen retail sales of physical retail pretty darn close to where it was pre-pandemic when looking at volume between in-person and online. And so those have performed very well.When you think about -- what was the last question?David Patrick RochesterThe marks on the office.Darren J. KingThe marks on -- yes. So when you look at where some of these are reappraising, they are coming -- the appraisals are coming down and affecting the LTV. When we would only put it into the allowance, if we have something that is criticized or not performing and we're worried about it, and we think that it would affect the recoverable value, and then we take that in, and we'll put that through the allowance and ultimately through charge-offs.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.Bill CarcacheDarren, could you address how you're thinking about the risk of tougher regulations following the SIVB fallout in [bar] as recent testimony, including in areas like TLAC and the elimination of the OCI opt out? And how could we see this as we see this play out, how could we see the effect on your appetite for buybacks and RWA growth?Darren J. KingSo I guess a couple of thoughts, Bill, on the OCI piece, when we've had that in mind for the last 3 years. And all the discussions that we've had over the prior number of years about putting the cash to work and the impact that, that might have in the securities portfolio on AOCI and our capital. We were looking at both the CET1 ratio as well as the tangible common equity ratio. And it was really the latter one that got us -- gave us a little bit of agita in debating how fast and how much to put into securities. And so from an OCI perspective, if that comes to pass and that goes into our capital ratios, at the end of the quarter, we had about $1.3 billion in total marks across the AFS and HTM portfolios. About $350 million was pretax the AFS mark. And so $264 million after tax, it's maybe 20 basis points of CET1. And then if you look at the total, you're maybe slightly below that, call it, 80-ish basis points of CET1, if you had to put both through.And so when we talk a little bit about our thoughts on capital and where we're kind of managing the CET1 ratio for the next little while, it's giving ourselves some cushion as these things play themselves out. And so from that perspective, it won't surprise me if that's a change that happens, but I think we're well covered and well prepared should that play itself out.When it comes to TLAC, that's really a longer-term change. I think when you look at what's happening in the industry right now. Most organizations have been increasing their use of wholesale funding and bank notes which ultimately will help with TLAC as it plays itself out. And then there's always the question of how Basel IV and those regulations come to pass and what the final proposals look like. And so we're trying to be mindful that those are changes that could come and not do something today that would put us in a place where we would have to raise equity or issue TLAC at a suboptimal time.Bill CarcacheThat's helpful, Darren. And if I can follow up on your deposit remixing commentary earlier. What's the noninterest-bearing mix that's implicit in your high 30% to low 40% beta expectation? And following up on the commentary about that noninterest-bearing mix, perhaps declining to pre-GFC levels that you mentioned. How are you thinking about that risk? What would that mean for betas?Darren J. KingSo I'll try and unpack that for you. The -- I give the comment about where rates were and where deposit -- or where balance sheets were pre-GFC to give context, right? That -- most of the time, when we talk about deposit betas in these industry forums, the point of reference tends to be the last rising rate environment, which was the '16 to '19 period, where Fed funds only got to about 2.25%. And so given where Fed funds are today and we'll see how long they stay there, it's important to keep in mind what balance sheet looks -- what bank balance sheets look like back in that time period.We might not get all the way back there. We probably won't get all the way back there depending on how long rates stay at this level, although it does look like they'll stay there longer than the last time, rates rose. And so when we look at the deposit mix and where things stabilize, we tend to look at and think about demand deposits in conjunction with interest checking and on balance sheet sweep. And what we've been seeing is some decline in those balances over time as deposit balances come out of the system with the Fed's quantitative tightening that they're doing. And what we think we'll see, which is included in that outlook is we'll see a continued shift from demand, particularly commercial clients, commercial and small business from noninterest bearing into interest checking and sweep. And that over time, you see those balances look maybe closer to 50-50 from where they are today in those particular categories. There'll still be interest -- noninterest deposits on the consumer side. And those you won't see as much movement into interest-bearing products because they don't tend to switch categories like that. And those are some of the factors that are implicit in those deposit betas. And really, the question to me is twofold. Where do Fed funds ultimately end up? And how long does it stay there?Operator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.Matthew Derek O'ConnorDarren, I want to circle back on the comment about NIM being below 4% for the full year and then trending to kind of that longer-term average I guess, first, just to confirm, is it still, I think, 3.6% to 3.9%, the long-term average that you've talked about?Darren J. KingThat is correct?Matthew Derek O'ConnorAnd then in terms of, I guess, like the timing of getting there and what are some of the obvious, like if rates go to 0, it will be the low end. But what are some of the kind of puts and takes like the 3.6% versus 3.9%. And then lastly, just to be in, like any thoughts on the jumping off point for the end of this year.Darren J. KingYes. So Matt, the biggest driver of the change in our posture and thoughts on NIM has really been the shift in funding sources, right? And so if you look at the work that we did in the first quarter, the $3.5 billion that we issued, we had talked about issuing wholesale over the course of the year. The markets were very receptive when we went out in January. And so we pulled forward a bunch of that funding, which had a big impact. We talked about 19 basis points on the NIM. And so where we stand today, when you look at our asset sensitivity, you can see we're kind of plus or minus 2%, which is where we try to run the bank. And so we'll see -- when we go through and we look at those factors and expectations that Fed funds are starting to top out and likely based on the forward curve, we see a decline in the end of the year. That's why you start to see that deposit -- or that margin start to come back down.But as I mentioned, with our asset sensitivity where it is, it's not going to drop precipitously because of the things that we've done with some of the forward starting swaps with the securities portfolio build, with the mix of fixed rate assets on the balance sheet and what have you. And so it will start to grind down into that range. But given over the long run, the reason we've talked about that range is because we expect over the long run that things ""normalize"". And what we mean by that is that the mix of deposits on the balance sheet looks more like what you would see in a normal rate environment. It's not extreme, like where we had 45% of the deposits in noninterest-bearing. That's not normal. As that changes, the margin comes down. We'll see a different -- or a mix of time deposits and what the rates are on time deposits, and that will affect the margin. We'll look at what percentage of the balance sheet sits in cash and securities and as those start to normalize you'll see an improvement in the margin. And so it's the shift in all of those categories that became very extreme through the pandemic that if they start to come back into what we would consider normal ranges, that's why we think that [3.60% to 3.90%] is a normal long-term range for our bank and our balance sheet, just kind of based on history. And so we'll start to see that migration happen. We started to see it, obviously, this quarter and at the end of last year, and it will continue through 2023.How fast we get there? It seems like things are moving pretty quickly right now just given quantitative tightening and how balances are shifting around the industry. As we get to the end of the year and the jumping off point for the margin, you're probably migrating towards the [3.60%] range for the last quarter of the year but there's a lot of factors that can get us there between now and then that would be kind of the low end of where I think we would end the year. For the whole year, we're in the ballpark of high 3s just based on that trajectory. And then when -- as we go through the year and the balances -- the deposit balances reprice you see some migration down, but it starts to level off as we get towards the back half of the year and you operate in that range through most of 2024 would be our expectation right now. But keep in mind, there's a lot of assumptions that go into that, not the least of which is what the forward curve looks like.Matthew Derek O'ConnorOkay. That was a lot of detail. But just to summarize, you think you get to the kind of lower end of the [3.6% to 3.9%] range by the end of the year, but that's kind of relatively stable for next year with all the caveats that you have highlighted?Darren J. KingYes. I would I would just alter that slightly and say that the bottom end of the range, you probably don't see until the first half of next year of that [3.60% to 3.90%], but you're slowly moving down as we go through the year. But as we get towards the end of the year, the rate of decline slows, and you kind of stabilize and hold flattish as we go through 2024.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.Kenneth Michael UsdinDarren has it going. Just a quick one on -- the fee guide going to 7.9% from 5% to 7% growth, is the entirety of that just the MSR [add] that you mentioned you did at the end of the quarter?Darren J. KingPretty much, yes.Kenneth Michael UsdinOkay. And then if I could just (inaudible) in the same one on the cost side. Do you -- in terms of like, the expected sale of the corporate Trust business, you gave us the revenue number in the press release. Do you have an approximate idea of like when that's going to close so we can just kind of think about taking out the fees and the expenses relative to that over the -- as the course of the year goes on.Darren J. KingYes, sure. The -- we expected to close this quarter for safety for you guys, I would assume that it's out of the run rate for the second half of the year. And you've got the revenue, the expenses are not quite the same as revenue, but they're not far off, which is one of the reasons why we're contemplating this move.Kenneth Michael UsdinOkay. Got it. Right. And you were pretty clear that the rest of the cost guide is inclusive of the MSR, any cost related to the MSR [adds].Darren J. KingThat's correct, right? And so in the guide, we have both the full year of the CIT business right now just to try and keep it apples-to-apples year-over-year as well as to let you know that we made that MSR purchase. But other than that, there are a few things that were kind of pulled forward in this quarter, some advertising expense, some of the items costs related to that divestiture that won't repeat themselves to try and just to give you guys a little bit of color as to why we still feel good about the full year guide.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.Gerard Sean CassidyCongratulations on your run as CFO. I guess, when you started in 2016, so I know you've got a heavy hit of replacing you, but good luck in the new role.Darren J. KingThank you. I appreciate it. It's been a run. There's a lot that we've seen. We love Bob and Mark. We went through a pandemic, bought the largest bank and went through a couple of bank failures. So it's been an eventful time.Gerard Sean CassidyIt sure (inaudible) helping new role, your spot rate on your -- MyChoice Money Market account is 3 basis points for under $10,000 in the account and over $10,000 that jumps at 2.96%.Darren J. KingI'm just trying to help out the new CFO, so that he has good numbers to report. They will be chastising me about why balances are leaving, but don't forget, that's the offer rate, not the portfolio rate, but I appreciate...Gerard Sean CassidySure. God, yes. No, no, I know. Absolutely. But here's my question. Speaking of deposit rates, can you share with us, and that you've alluded to this in some of your answers, if the Fed reaches its terminal rate on Fed funds in June, let's say, at 5%, 5.5%. And does not cut even though I know you're looking at the forward curve, that includes 2 cuts in the fourth quarter. Say they don't cut until maybe the first half of '24 . When does your deposit betas go flat after reaching the terminal rate and second, if they go flat 60 days afterwards or whatever you think the number would be, do you then benefit from reinvesting the cash flows off of the securities portfolio into a higher rate environment, assuming the Fed doesn't cut the Fed funds rate.Darren J. KingSo when you stop -- start seeing a slowdown in deposit repricing, history has been, its typically 1 to 2 quarters after the Fed stops. And so I would expect even if the Fed stopped in the summer and cut in the fourth quarter, you might not -- you wouldn't see a change in deposit betas in all likelihood until sometime in next year. If you get into the space where they stop and then hold and it goes into 2024, the same thing would be true in terms of you'd see deposit betas go up for a quarter or 2 after and then start to level off. In all of these things in the pricing, in the ultimate beta, there's a couple of factors to keep in mind, right? We've always talked about it in terms of where Fed funds is. But as we look at the bank and the balance sheet, there's a bunch of trade-offs that are being made, right? And so for interest-bearing deposits, there's a cost that is born that you need to offer to the customers. But then there's other alternatives that you can look at to meet those funding needs is brokered money market, it's brokered CD, it's wholesale funding, right?And so our preference is, if we're going to give rate, we'd rather give it to our customers than to the capital market. But at the end of the day, you're always making those trade-offs, and then it's the mix shift that happens. For our clients, as they are a reflection of the economy, just as any bank's clients are. Consumers are going to keep some amount of money in their checking accounts if they're comfortable with. And every person has their own number, but they won't go below it unless they're in dire circumstances.Businesses are the same way. And so there's a certain amount of deposits that are going to be on each bank's balance sheet and then within each category, the market is pretty perfect. And we can't pay materially less for money market savings in Buffalo than our competitors can. And the same thing is true for time in the other categories. And so there's a natural governor in the market that gets all of these different deposit categories to their normal -- what I would call, their normal pricing, right? And then what kind of differentiates one bank from the next is their mix. And our advantage has always been that we tend to focus on operating accounts, whether it's consumers or commercial customers, and we have a slightly higher mix of those in our funding, which ultimately helps our cost of funds. And so those will be the things that will determine where we end up and how big our beta is perhaps compared to others. But we think it's -- the betas continue after Fed fund stops for a little bit. And the terminal amount is as much a function of your mix of deposits as how high the absolute number goes.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.Steven A. AlexopoulosI'm curious, in the aftermath of SVB, which was obviously all over the news, what are you hearing now from your large deposit customers, right? Are they looking to diversify that you guys lose balances to larger banks, has the storm now passed? Just any color you could provide how this is impacting a bank like yours would be really helpful.Darren J. KingYes. No, happy to. The long story short was that the change was a positive for us for adding clients and adding accounts. And so we're hopeful that we were able to serve as a source of strength and to help some of these folks out when these changes happened. And we were, I would say, a net slightly positive as a result of all the disruption that happened in these various markets. For our clients, when we look at particularly our commercial clients and the average tenure, 20-25-year relationships. And so they know us well, and they tend to worry a little bit less. That said, there are some people who chose to move some money into some of the money funds for diversification for rates as well as some of their comfort level. We didn't lose a ton to be honest with you, to the larger organizations. But what I would say is in some of those shifts, we were a recipient of balances as much as we saw in outflow. And so when you add in some of the accounts that we opened during the crisis, the net was a slight positive. And so for us, it wasn't the big shift in balances that many were anticipating more, I would say, as much a continuation of the trend that we've been talking about of, as quantitative tightening happens, as rates are moving up and the money -- the rates paid on the money funds always moves faster than the deposit accounts on the balance sheet. That normal migration is happening. And over time, we expect it will come back as those other rates start to match what you can get in the funds.OperatorI will take our last question from Brian Foran with Autonomous Research.Brian D. ForanI guess just quickly on lending, it sounds like any underwriting changes on your end or only marginal, if I got that comment about focusing liquidity on our best customers right? So I just want to confirm that. And then just more broadly, I definitely appreciate the point that the rollover in commercial real estate, in particular, is fairly slow. But do you think some of your peers will change underwriting more significantly as people worry about a credit crunch in lending and CRE in particular, do you think that's a valid concern? Or do you think that's overblown right now?Darren J. KingSo I can't speak to what others will do. I think there's a big difference between the banks and the REITs and the CMBS and how they underwrite and how they've underwritten and how they think about things. For us, in particular, we don't move our credit standards very much at all. And I think we've talked about this for a while that we've had 2 chief credit officers since 1983. Our viewpoint on underwriting is pretty consistent. And we try to be the same through good times and bad, right? Because what our clients value is consistency and knowing what they need to have in terms of a profile of the loan for us to be there. I think for us and the industry, as you look at what's maturing, there's a question of how many alternative sources of funds are available for those loans, particularly in the real estate space. And so as loans mature, one of the questions will be, is there another bank or a fund or someone out there who is ready to take that loan on, which obviously will be a function of the debt service coverage and the loan to value. What likely happens though is as prices are challenged in the short term, as you'll see some sponsors will have the ability to put in some extra equity which will help with the underwriting. You might see some A note, B, note structures. You might see some outside private equity money come in, in the form of preferred or [mezz] debt to help with some of those shortfalls. So I think what's typical within real estate is it's nuanced, right? It's hard to give a blanket statement about what will happen. It's more client-by-client and property-by-property that you work through these things. And so like I said, for us, we preserve our capital and our liquidity for our best customers and many of these ones, particularly in real estate have been around for a long time. Like we're in the second or third generation of supporting them, and we'll continue to do that. But there's always opportunity when this kind of disruption occurs and we'll be paying close attention to that as well.OperatorAnd it appears we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to Brian Klock for closing remarks.Brian Paul KlockAgain, thank you all for participating today.

He tells Yahoo Finance’s Rachelle Akuffo to expect a “down earnings season” in the first quarter as he laid out his roadmap for how he thinks corporate results will shakeout in the wake of March's banking turmoil. Laidler says reported numbers are “going to look good,” with the strongest earnings to come from “small caps, the cyclicals, consumer discretionary names.” However he suggests looking under the hood, as those companies could suffer the most in an economic slowdown. That's “inevitably coming” he adds, labelling this results season as a “little bit of a head fake.”Laidler says his fear is “what comes next”, anticipating “downbeat” guidance in earnings reports. Specifically in focus for Laidler is the tightening of lending conditions by banks. This has been the topic of some debate in recent weeks, with the likes of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and the IMF seemingly on different pages. He clarifies he wouldn’t consider the turmoil following SVB and Signature Bank’s collapses a “crisis,” but instead a “banking scare.” More an issue of individual banks “rather than the system,” but still with real macroeconomic consequences. Commodities in particular are “particularly sensitive” to the slowdown of growth. We have yet to see the final fallout from the banking turmoil, and Laidler encourages all to monitor earnings as they're reported this week.Key Video Moments:00:00:25 - Commodities are the ""canary in the coal mine"" for slowdown in growth00:00:56 - Tech, healthcare remain defensive00:01:24 - Reported numbers will look ""good"" for earnings season00:01:48 - Guidance will be more downbeat, looking ahead00:02:00 - Best earnings will come from companies that will suffer the most from economic slowdownFor more of Rachelle’s conversation with Ben Laidler, click here.Story continuesVideo TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: And we mentioned some of that hangover from, as you call it, a banking scare, the IMF looking at it as a banking crisis. But really, as you look at tighter lending conditions really feeding into this slower global growth story as well, are there some signs that we should be watching for? You mentioned small caps there. How it's going to play out for them.BEN LAIDLER: Yeah, absolutely. The stock market's not the economy. There are some segments of the market which are the canary in the coal mine, which are particularly sensitive to this tightening of lending standards, to the slowing of the economy. Commodities, I don't think it's any surprise that that's the worst performing asset class this year, particularly sensitive to the slowdown in growth.Small caps, they're still up for the year but they've absolutely lagged. Again, that's no surprise, very domestic, carry a bit more debt, less diversified. Industrials, I mean, these are the bits that I think are particularly sensitive to this slowdown.And on the flip side, there are things like tech, things like health care, which are pretty defensive, are very big in the stock market, but somewhat less big in the overall economy.RACHELLE AKUFFO: So then when you add up some of this tightening that we're going to see, the banking scare, how are you seeing that, or how are you expecting that to show up in some of this earnings commentary as we get into the thick of earnings season?BEN LAIDLER: So I think this is going to be another less bad earnings season. I think the reported numbers are going to look pretty good and we're all going to breathe a sigh of relief. I mean, GDP growth in the first quarter was something like 2 and 1/2%. It was pretty good. Expectations were cut a lot into earnings season. And 40% of US earnings come from the rest of the world, which has seen a particularly good sort of rebound here off very low levels.So I think the reported numbers are going to look very good. My fear is what comes next. And I think the guidance is going to be a little bit more downbeat. In some ways, I actually think this reporting season is going to be a little bit of a head fake. I think the best results are going to come from the small caps, the cyclicals, the consumer discretionary names, the ones that are maybe going to suffer the most in the economic slowdown which I think is inevitably coming.]"

The firm showed heavier outflows from non-interest bearing accounts, Katzke wrote.There is growing competition for deposits. Apple Inc said on Monday that Apple Card users can earn 4.15% on their savings account, which it said was ten times higher than the national average.Federal Reserve data released on Friday showed deposits at all commercial banks rose to $17.43 trillion in the week ended April 5, an increase about evenly shared between the largest 25 banks and the small and mid-sized banks. That left deposits at the largest banks above the levels prior to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, but at small banks still short of their previous levels.Story continuesSchwab, which was caught up in the crisis last month, paused stock buybacks, but moved to allay concerns about its financial strength. Its chief executive officer, Walter Bettinger, addressed commentary about portfolios of debt securities held by banks, including Schwab, which are disclosed as unrealized losses in their earnings.""I would certainly hope that by this point the short-driven speculation that we would find ourselves in a position where we would be forced to sell securities that have temporary paper losses has been put to bed,"" Bettinger said on a conference call.Fitch Senior Director Bain Rumohr said Schwab's net revenue may be modestly pressured throughout 2023 as higher cost funding sources weigh on net interest income, ""but the firm’s size and scale ... should support profit margins at levels consistent with historical levels.""

(NASDAQ: AKAM), the cloud company that powers and protects life online, today released a new State of the Internet (SOTI) report that focuses on the increasing proliferation of application and API attacks. Titled, Slipping through the Security Gaps: The Rise of Application and API Attacks, the report finds that such attacks are growing in both frequency and complexity as adversaries look for more innovative ways to exploit this growing attack surface.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logo (PRNewsfoto/Akamai Technologies, Inc.)Last year was another record-breaking year for application and API attacks as they grew by 137 percent. This is a major concern since organizations are adopting more web applications and APIs to enhance their business and increase ease of use for customers. The report finds that Local File Inclusion (LFI) remains the top attack vector with year-over-year growth of 193 percent.The new Akamai research also provides details on several emerging attack vectors such as Server-Side Template Injections (SSTI). With this technique, attackers abuse notable vulnerabilities such as Log4Shell, Spring4Shell and the Atlassian confluence vulnerability. SSTI poses serious business risks as attacks can lead to remote code execution and data exfiltration. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks are another up-and-coming attack vector that poses a substantial threat to organizations. Akamai observes a daily average of 14 million SSRF attempts against our customers' web applications and APIs.In addition, Security Gaps: The Rise of Application and API Attacks spotlights Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA). The top concern in the API threat landscape according to the OWASP API Top 10, BOLA is a simple, yet high risk attack that enables access to the information of other users. The report offers guidance and best practices around mitigating this growing vulnerability.Story continuesOther main findings of the report include:Attacks on the healthcare industry grew by 82 percent. The adoption of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) in the healthcare sector expands the attack surface of this vertical and could lead to increased vulnerabilities.Median attacks on the manufacturing sector grew by 76 percent due to the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) connections and the massive data collected from equipment in this sector. Successful cyberattacks against operating technologies in this industry enable real-world impacts like supply chain issues.The new proposed OWASP API Top 10 emphasizes the divergence of attack vectors between web applications and APIs.API attacks directed at the business logic of the API are complicated to detect and mitigate and cannot be determined at the individual request level.  Pre-existing knowledge is required, such as the specific business logic and the resources accessible by each user.Webshells allow for a simple and effective way to interact with web servers as they are stealthier than regular shells and present an attractive arsenal for attackers. Trending webshells discussed in the report include the China Chopper and Behinder webshells.""As cybercriminals evaluate who provides the best return on investment based on the level of effort, the value of data or the likelihood of paying extortion, we often see shifts in attack trends,"" said Rupesh Chokshi, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Application Security at Akamai. ""Security Gaps: The Rise of Application and API Attacks offers insight into the attacks that organizations should be most concerned about and provides mitigation strategies for countering these threats such as stopping vectors at the edge, segmentation and patching.""For additional information, the security community can access, engage with, and learn from Akamai's threat researchers by visiting the Akamai Security Hub and following the team on Twitter at @Akamai_Research.About AkamaiAkamai powers and protects life online.

208,d77ef855-c5c4-3dae-87e0-3da768820fd1,HP,2023-04-18,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc.'s (NYSE:HP) Popularity With Investors Is Clear",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/helmerich-payne-inc-nyse-hp-180619723.html,1681754779,STORY,['HP'],"[With a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 25.7x Helmerich &amp; Payne, Inc. (NYSE:HP) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 15x and even P/E's lower than 7x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Helmerich &amp; Payne could be doing better as it's been growing earnings less than most other companies lately. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this lacklustre earnings performance will improve markedly. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Helmerich &amp; Payne pe-multiple-vs-industryKeen to find out how analysts think Helmerich &amp; Payne's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Enough Growth For Helmerich &amp; Payne?Helmerich &amp; Payne's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.If we review the last year of earnings, the company posted a result that saw barely any deviation from a year ago. That's essentially a continuation of what we've seen over the last three years, as its EPS growth has been virtually non-existent for that entire period. So it seems apparent to us that the company has struggled to grow earnings meaningfully over that time.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 47% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.8% per year, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that Helmerich &amp; Payne's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.As we suspected, our examination of Helmerich &amp; Payne's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.It's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with Helmerich &amp; Payne, and understanding should be part of your investment process.If P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies with strong earnings growth and low P/E ratios.Have feedback on this article?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $700.7 million, suggesting a year-over-year increase of 10.5%.The company anticipates non-GAAP earnings in the range of $2.36-$2.48 per share ($2.42 at the midpoint). The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $2.42 per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of approximately 13.6%.F5, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseF5, Inc. price-eps-surprise | F5, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderF5’s sustained focus on transitioning the business into a software-driven model is anticipated to have aided the company’s overall performance in the fiscal second quarter. The surging demand for multi-cloud application services is expected to have been a key growth driver during the quarter.Growing traction for the Enterprise License Agreement and annual subscriptions by customers are likely to have boosted software growth in the to-be-reported quarter. F5’s fiscal second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the hybrid work environment and the ongoing digital transformation wave, which is boosting the demand for secured communication networks.Furthermore, an improvement in the supply chain is likely to have helped the company meet the demand for its Systems’ products in the second quarter. This is likely to have boosted its Systems’ segment revenues during the to-be-reported quarter.However, enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. This may have hurt F5’s overall financial performance in the fiscal second quarter.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for FFIV this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.Story continuesThough F5 carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present, it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

NDAQ may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Nasdaq is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NDAQ in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NDAQ, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.44% heading into earnings season.Nasdaq, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNasdaq, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNasdaq, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Nasdaq, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that NDAQ has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Nasdaq, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.33% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.92%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the cable provider had gained 5.36% over the past month. This has lagged the Consumer Discretionary sector's gain of 5.57% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.67% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Comcast as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be April 27, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.82, down 4.65% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $29.41 billion, down 5.16% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.66 per share and revenue of $120.03 billion. These totals would mark changes of +0.55% and -1.15%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Comcast should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.27% lower within the past month. Comcast currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).In terms of valuation, Comcast is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 10.39. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 11.36, so we one might conclude that Comcast is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesWe can also see that CMCSA currently has a PEG ratio of 0.82. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Cable Television stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 0.82 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Cable Television industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector.

To further support the area, which was badly damaged in storms earlier this year, and to create greater digital equity, Comcast also donated $75,000 to United Way of Merced and $25,000 to the San Joaquin Regional Broadband Consortium. At the event, Comcast surprised approximately 100 graduating 8th graders from Planada’s Cesar Chavez Middle School with free laptops and school supply kits. Local dignitaries along with Planada youth and their families attended the celebration.Expanding its next-generation, fiber-rich Xfinity 10G Network and commercial broadband services to rural areas is an important part of Comcast’s overall effort to increase digital equity. Today’s groundbreaking event was attended by local elected officials as well as community and business partners who celebrated Comcast’s announcement of its expansion of multi-gig broadband internet speeds, video, mobile, voice, home security, and business products and services. The Central Valley is an area of focus for Comcast in California, as this announcement comes one year after the company expanded broadband services to Biola, CA, a rural community in Fresno County. Work is now underway on network expansion projects in several other areas of Fresno and Merced Counties.“The investments made by Comcast today will not only benefit our students, residents and businesses but also contribute to our rural economic development -- especially as we’re coming out of a severe winter season and the pandemic,” said Rodrigo Espinosa, Merced County Board of Supervisors. “We all know the need for fast, secure Internet service is more important now than it has ever been and I’m grateful to companies like Comcast who are making these investments in our community to create lasting change and impact.”Story continuesComcast concluded the event by making $100,000 in donations to Planada non-profit organizations. United Way of Merced County received $75,000 for storm relief efforts and other community programs and the San Joaquin Regional Broadband Consortium received $25,000 to support digital equity efforts. These grants were distributed through Project UP, Comcast’s $1 billion commitment to reach tens of millions of people in order to advance digital equity and help create a future of unlimited possibilities.“As the world we live in continues to become more digital than ever before, we must work with our business and community partners like Comcast to make sure all communities -- especially our rural communities like Planada -- are connected to the growing digital economy,” said Jose Gonzalez, Superintendent of Planada School District. “I’m thankful for public-private partnerships such as this one with Comcast, because it allows us to work together to provide the necessary tools and resources for our students to succeed and create vital educational opportunities for them in the future.”“After this season of unprecedented, severe weather, Merced County has especially felt the impact of the recent storm damage, said Robert Hypes, Interim CEO, United Way of Merced County. “From the very beginning, Comcast worked with us to support the communities of Merced County. During the first wave of storms in January, Comcast provided WiFi services to the evacuation shelters to keep our communities connected and safe. When the City of Merced issued an evacuation order for areas with flooding risk from Bear Creek, Comcast joined forces with us and delivered food, beverages, and personal hygiene kits to over 300 people at the Merced County Fairground evacuation center. We are so excited that Comcast will continue its partnership with the United Way of Merced County, granting us $50,000 to support disaster relief efforts. We plan on using this contribution to fund long-term recovery efforts and fill unmet needs among our residents and their families.”When Comcast’s network expansion is completed, Planada residential customers will have access to reliable and fast Xfinity Internet and Mobile services, including Internet Essentials, which provides eligible customers with high-speed Internet access at home for $9.95 per month (plus tax) and Internet Essentials Plus for $29.95 per month (plus tax) for qualified families/individuals. If individuals sign up for the Federal Government’s Affordable Connectivity Program, which offers a $30 per month subsidy ($75 per month in tribal areas), then both tiers of service are effectively free. For local businesses, Comcast Business offers a suite of connectivity, communications, networking, cybersecurity, wireless, and managed solutions to help organizations of different sizes prepare for what’s next.Powered by the Xfinity 10G NetworkComcast’s next-generation network and Internet experience are powering homes today and into the future:Ultimate Capacity: Xfinity customers connect nearly 1 billion devices across the company’s network annually. The Xfinity 10G Network with the next-generation Xfinity gateways deliver the most advanced WiFi technology carrying three times more bandwidth to power streaming, gaming, videoconferencing, and more, simultaneously.Fastest Internet: More than one third of Xfinity Internet customers subscribe to gigabit speed products, and Ookla rated Xfinity the fastest Internet provider at the end of 2022. Symmetrical gig speeds to the first homes are planned for later this year.Unprecedented Coverage: The latest Xfinity Gateway provides a more reliable connection throughout the home. Customers can get wall-to-wall WiFi coverage with a powerful xFi Pod that extends coverage to hard-to-reach areas, with plans for an offering of increased support for in-home WiFi through a “boost guarantee” later this year.Most Reliable Connection: Comcast is scaling the nation’s largest and most reliable network – the Xfinity 10G Network – that passes 60 million homes and business and counting. The company plans to launch a new device that is “storm-ready” with cellular and battery backup to help keep customers connected even when the power goes out.Ultra-Low Latency: The Xfinity 10G Network and the latest xFi Gateway are a powerful combination that deliver ultra-low latency for those moments when response times matter most like video games, a fast-growing category with Xfinity households averaging more than one gaming console per home.More information about the Xfinity 10G Network can be found here.About Comcast Corporation Comcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA) is a global media and technology company.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is Axa (AXAHY). AXAHY is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 8.27, which compares to its industry's average of 8.83. AXAHY's Forward P/E has been as high as 9.12 and as low as 6.47, with a median of 7.89, all within the past year.Investors should also recognize that AXAHY has a P/B ratio of 1.37. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 2.58.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks To Buy Now.""Semiconductors Are Showing Really Terrific Leadership""On April 11 Bill Baruch, president and COO of Blue Creek Capital Management, appeared in an interview on TD Ameritrade Network where he discussed the current trends in the semiconductor industry and his outlook for semiconductor stocks. Baruch thinks that inflation is cooling down and this bodes well for equity markets.Baruch further spoke about the tech rally we have experienced so far. He talked about some of the recent gains of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and noted that ""semiconductors are showing really terrific leadership"". Baruch noted that the focus of semiconductor stocks was not the weakness in PC demand, but instead it was Samsung's (KSE:005930) recently announced production cut. On April 7, Samsung (KSE:005930) announced that it is cutting memory chip output after the company's Q1 2023 operating profit fell to $455.5 million, the lowest since the global financial crisis. Samsung (KSE:005930) believes that cutting memory chip production by a ""meaningful"" level will help it restore the supply-demand imbalance within semiconductors and survive a potential downturn. Here are some comments from Bill Baruch:""The Samsung (KSE:005930) news of cutting chip production was the focus of semiconductors and not the slowing PC demand, and I think that's because PC demand has been known to be slowing. That's a lagging number for quarter 1. Let's look ahead, when you see the inventory cycles of the semiconductors, and we're getting out of the worst of it. The focus isn't right here right now, it's the 2024, and that is really becoming a tailwind to semiconductors who wrote down those expectations in the middle of last year. Again, it's a market of have and have-nots. The stocks that have written down those expectations and the companies that have not. We're starting to see this focus into the 2024 numbers, and my reason to bring that up is that it gives the market (semiconductor market) leadership here.""Story continuesThough ""having the leadership within the market is extremely important"", Bill Baruch noted that it has to be coupled with inflation coming down since inflation remains the Fed's top priority. As inflation cools down, the Fed can stop its hiking cycle and this will create a positive environment for semiconductors and the tech space.Heading into 2024, Bill Baruch expects semiconductor stocks to lead the market as inflation cools down and the Fed stops tightening. In the current market environment, many semiconductor stocks have bottomed and are currently trading at attractive valuations.

With the latest hike, the payout currently stands at 61.5 cents per share compared with the prior payout of 56 cents.Denoting the 12th consecutive year of a dividend hike, the increased dividend will be paid on May 15, 2023, to shareholders of record as on May 1. Based on the stock’s Apr 14 closing price of $324.48, the new dividend will yield 0.7% to the company.Aon has been a regular dividend-paying company for more than two decades. Besides, its dividend has witnessed a 12-year CAGR of 12.5%.Apart from implementing dividend hikes, Aon boasts a robust history of rewarding shareholders in the form of share buybacks as well.  Its Repurchase Program commenced with an initial authorization of $5 billion and has been in place since 2012.Thereafter, the authorization was further enhanced by $5 billion each in November 2014, June 2017 and November 2020, respectively.  In February 2022, the same was increased by $7.5 billion. At the end of 2022, it had a leftover capacity of roughly $6 billion under its Repurchase Program. As part of the program, Aon bought back shares worth around $21.5 billion, thereby substantiating its active buyback pursuits.A strong financial position equips a company to pursue uninterrupted share buybacks and dividend payments. The same has been the case with Aon, which is backed by a solid cash balance and robust cash-generation abilities. As of Dec 31, 2022, AON’s cash and cash equivalents increased 26.8% from the 2021-end level. It generated solid operating cash flows of $3.2 billion in 2022, which advanced 47.5% year over year.

223,c84d58b1-fabd-31fa-a1f2-c87ae75b6d85,AON,2023-04-18,Here's What You Should Know Ahead of AmEx (AXP) Q1 Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-know-ahead-amex-axp-131701268.html,1681737421,STORY,"['AXP', 'AON']","[American Express Company AXP is set to report first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 20, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the diversified financial services company’s adjusted earnings per share of $2.07 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.1%, primarily due to higher operating and customer engagement costs. Weakness in International Card Services and Commercial Services businesses affected AmEx’s profit levels. The negatives were partially offset by continued business momentum, better volumes and higher Card Member spending.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the first-quarter earnings announcement.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.70 per share for first-quarter earnings has remained stable over the past week. The consensus mark indicates a 1.1% decline from the year-ago reported figure, while our estimate suggests a 4.3% fall. American Express beat earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering an average surprise of 4.5%. This is depicted in the graph below.American Express Company Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company price-eps-surprise | American Express Company QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $14 billion, suggesting a jump of 19% from the year-ago reported figure. We expect first-quarter revenues to witness a 19.5% year-over-year increase.Factors to NoteAmerican Express is likely to have witnessed improved volumes in the to-be-reported quarter, a trend seen over the last several quarters. It is expected to have increased due to total network volumes and billed business volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter total network volumes indicates 15.9% year-over-year growth, while our estimate suggests a 21.6% increase.An overall resilient consumer spending level is likely to have supported Discount revenues, AXP’s largest revenue driver. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Discount revenues indicates 15.5% year-over-year growth, while our estimate suggests an 18.7% increase.Story continuesTravel and Entertainment (T&amp;E) is rapidly increasing in most parts of the world, overcoming the COVID-19 woes. T&amp;E-related spending is likely to have jumped in the quarter under review. Fees, commissions and other revenues are expected to have improved on the back of an uptick in travel-related revenues. As such, card acquisitions in some of AXP’s largest travel co-brand portfolios are anticipated to have expanded.Cards-in-force is expected to have witnessed an uptick in the quarter under review. While the consensus mark for total cards-in-force indicates a 9.6% year-over-year increase, our estimate suggests 10.2% growth.American Express’s interest income, the second-largest revenue contributor, is likely to have risen on higher loan disbursements. The consensus mark for AXP’s interest income suggests an upside of 59.7% from the year-ago reported figure. We expect the figure to increase 39.1% from the year-ago period. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Merchant and Network Services’ pre-tax income indicates a 6.5% year-over-year increase while our estimate suggests an 8% jump.The above-mentioned factors are likely to have contributed to AXP’s first-quarter performance. However, the rising expenses in global commercial services, card member rewards, marketing and business development are expected to have reduced margins, making an earnings beat uncertain. Our estimate suggests total expenses to have witnessed a 20.2% year-over-year increase in the quarter, which is likely to have reduced profit levels.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for American Express this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -1.45%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at $2.66 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.70.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: American Express currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for American Express, here are some companies from the broader finance space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Owl Rock Capital Corporation ORCC has an Earnings ESP of +0.47% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player.

Wall Street analysts expect comparable sales rise this quarter, with three brokerages lifting their price targets ahead of company earnings on April 25.The burger changes have already been rolled out in Australia, Canada and Belgium.

On the other side of things, if you're not getting in shape and you want burgers, well, we've got your story. If you were loving McDonald's already, it may be in for a big-time quality upgrade, the company announcing today some small but tasty improvements to the Big Mac, McDouble, and all their burger items. The updates include softer buns, cheese melted to perfection, onions added on the grill not after the fact, and more of everyone's favorite Big Mac sauce in every bite.Not much of an investor story. The stock not much movement on this action. But some good news. Up just a bit. It was hovering around the neutral point all day long. But for customers of McDonald's, certainly some good news. And the marketing story here? The Hamburglar is back! He's back in the marketing profile, which excites me very much.- I think this is important. Because look, people are tightening their belts. They are watching what they spend on, as I mentioned earlier. And even in this price point, even when you're talking about McDonald's. Because we know that the prices have been going up across the board, across all restaurant tiers. And so if you are going to spend the money on a burger, you want it to be-- I mean, you want that cheese to be warm. You want the onions to be grilled.- Yeah, I-- Just as a burger connoisseur, I do notice a lot of times at McDonald's the cheese isn't melted. And that is worthless. You can't put the cheese on after the fact. And the onions the same thing. I think they're the problem here. And again, breaking down the burger. I lose a lot of sleep over this. The onions on the McDonald's burger always kind of were crunchy. And instead you want the flavor to seep into the burger. You don't want to crunch on those onions after the fact. So good news, I think, for fans of McDonald's. I don't know about the more sauce, though, on the Big Mac. That takes away from the flavor of the burger. But maybe they tried to mask it a little bit.Story continues- They should hire you.- I'm not sure.- Dave as a connoisseur.- Yes I got a lot of thoughts on this. I could write a novel.- He needs to be talking to you.]"

Please see our Notes and Definitions for further explanation. Adjusted EBITDA. We use Adjusted EBITDA attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (""Adjusted EBITDA""), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of our operating performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net earnings.We calculate Adjusted EBITDA by beginning with consolidated net earnings attributable to common stockholders and removing the effect of: interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, gains or losses from the disposition of investments in real estate (excluding development properties and land), gains from the revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt and derivative contracts (including cash charges), similar adjustments we make to our FFO measures (see definition below), and other items, such as, amortization of stock based compensation and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency and derivatives. We also include a pro forma adjustment to reflect a full period of NOI on the operating properties we acquire or stabilize during the quarter and to remove NOI on properties we dispose of during the quarter, assuming all transactions occurred at the beginning of the quarter. The pro forma adjustment also includes economic ownership changes in our ventures to reflect the full quarter at the new ownership percentage.We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view our operating performance, analyze our ability to meet interest payment obligations and make quarterly preferred stock dividends on an unleveraged basis before the effects of income tax, depreciation and amortization expense, gains and losses on the disposition of non-development properties and other items (outlined above), that affect comparability. While all items are not infrequent or unusual in nature, these items may result from market fluctuations that can have inconsistent effects on our results of operations. The economics underlying these items reflect market and financing conditions in the short-term but can obscure our performance and the value of our long-term investment decisions and strategies.We calculate our Adjusted EBITDA, based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures.  We reflect our share of our Adjusted EBITDA measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis.  We reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our Adjusted EBITDA measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods.While we believe Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure, it should not be used alone because it excludes significant components of net earnings, such as our historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, distribution requirements, contractual commitments or interest and principal payments on our outstanding debt and is therefore limited as an analytical tool.Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to EBITDA reported by other companies in both the real estate industry and other industries. We compensate for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to GAAP, along with this detailed discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to Adjusted EBITDA from consolidated net earnings attributable to common stockholders.Business Line Reporting is a non-GAAP financial measure. Core FFO and development gains are generated by our three lines of business: (i) real estate operations; (ii) strategic capital; and (iii) development.  The real estate operations line of business represents total Prologis Core FFO, less the amount allocated to the strategic capital line of business.  The amount of Core FFO allocated to the strategic capital line of business represents the third-party share of asset management fees and transactional fees that we earn from our consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures less costs directly associated with our strategic capital group and Net Promote Income. Realized development gains include our share of gains on dispositions of development properties and land, net of taxes. To calculate the per share amount, the amount generated by each line of business is divided by the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding used in our Core FFO per share calculation. Management believes evaluating our results by line of business is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance because it helps the investing public compare the operating performance of Prologis' respective businesses to other companies' comparable businesses. Prologis' computation of FFO by line of business may not be comparable to that reported by other real estate companies as they may use different methodologies in computing such measures.Calculation of Per Share AmountsThree Months EndedMarch 31,in thousands, except per share amount20232022Net earningsNet earnings attributable to common stockholders$463,170$1,149,254Noncontrolling interest attributable to exchangeable limited partnership units11,74332,338Adjusted net earnings attributable to common stockholders - Diluted$474,913$1,181,592Weighted average common shares outstanding - Basic923,888740,368Incremental weighted average effect on exchange of limited partnership units23,53521,089Incremental weighted average effect of equity awards4,2014,060Weighted average common shares outstanding - Diluted951,624765,517Net earnings per share - Basic$0.50$1.55Net earnings per share - Diluted$0.50$1.54Core FFOCore FFO attributable to common stockholders/unitholders$1,156,973$833,879Noncontrolling interest attributable to exchangeable limited partnership units170139Core FFO attributable to common stockholders/unitholders - Diluted$1,157,143$834,018Weighted average common shares outstanding - Basic923,888740,368Incremental weighted average effect on exchange of limited partnership units23,53521,089Incremental weighted average effect of equity awards4,2014,060Weighted average common shares outstanding - Diluted951,624765,517Core FFO per share - Diluted$1.22$1.09Development Portfolio includes industrial and non-industrial properties, yards and parking lots that are under development and properties that are developed but have not met Stabilization. At March 31, 2023, total TEI for yards, parking lots and non-industrial assets was $218.8 million and $209.7 million on an Owned and Managed and Prologis Share basis, respectively. We do not disclose square footage for yards and parking lots.Estimated Value Creation represents the value that we expect to create through our development and leasing activities. We calculate Estimated Value Creation by estimating the Stabilized NOI that the property will generate and applying a stabilized capitalization rate applicable to that property. Estimated Value Creation is calculated as the amount by which the value exceeds our TEI and does not include any fees or promotes we may earn.Estimated Weighted Average Margin is calculated on development properties as Estimated Value Creation, less estimated closing costs and taxes, if any, on properties expected to be sold or contributed, divided by TEI.Estimated Weighted Average Stabilized Yield is calculated on the properties in the Development Portfolio as Stabilized NOI divided by TEI. The yields on a Prologis Share basis were as follows:Pre-StabilizedDevelopments2023 Expected Completion2024 and Thereafter ExpectedCompletionTotal Development PortfolioU.S.6.8%5.9%6.6%6.1%Other Americas7.4%8.2%8.2%8.1%Europe5.9%5.5%7.6%5.7%Asia5.2%5.6%5.1%5.3%Total6.0%5.9%6.8%6.2%FFO, as modified by Prologis attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (""FFO, as modified by Prologis""); Core FFO attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (""Core FFO""); AFFO attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (""AFFO""); (collectively referred to as ""FFO""). FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO is net earnings.The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (""NAREIT"") defines FFO as earnings computed under GAAP to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from sales net of any related tax, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated properties. We also exclude the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment, as these are similar to gains from the sales of previously depreciated properties. We exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties' share of our consolidated co-investment ventures.Our FFO MeasuresOur FFO measures begin with NAREIT's definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy.  While not infrequent or unusual, the additional items we adjust for in calculating FFO, as modified by Prologis, Core FFO and AFFO, as defined below, are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period. Although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements, the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term.  These items have both positive and negative short-term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long-term outlook.We calculate our FFO measures, as defined below, based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures.  We reflect our share of our FFO measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis.  We reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our FFO measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods.These FFO measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses. We do not use our FFO measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under GAAP, as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under GAAP or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.We analyze our operating performance principally by the rental revenues of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business, net of operating, administrative and financing expenses. This income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities.FFO, as modified by Prologis To arrive at FFO, as modified by Prologis, we adjust the NAREIT defined FFO measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency related items and deferred tax, specifically:(i)deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries;(ii)current income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities that were recorded as deferred tax liabilities in an acquisition, to the extent the expense is offset with a deferred income tax benefit in earnings that is excluded from our defined FFO measure;(iii)foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from (a) debt transactions between us and our foreign entities, (b) third-party debt that is used to hedge our investment in foreign entities, (c) derivative financial instruments related to any such debt transactions, and (d) mark-to-market adjustments associated with other derivative financial instruments.We use FFO, as modified by Prologis, so that management, analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other REITs that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S.Core FFO In addition to FFO, as modified by Prologis, we also use Core FFO. To arrive at Core FFO, we adjust FFO, as modified by Prologis, to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognize directly in FFO, as modified by Prologis:(i)gains or losses from the disposition of land and development properties that were developed with the intent to contribute or sell;(ii)income tax expense related to the sale of investments in real estate;(iii)impairment charges recognized related to our investments in real estate generally as a result of our change in intent to contribute or sell these properties;(iv)gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt and redemption and repurchase of preferred stock; and(v)expenses related to natural disasters.We use Core FFO, including by segment and region, to: (i) assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies; (ii) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods; (iii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iv) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (v) provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance; and (vi) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results.AFFOTo arrive at AFFO, we adjust Core FFO to include realized gains from the disposition of land and development properties, net of current tax expense, and recurring capital expenditures and exclude the following items that we recognize directly in Core FFO:(i)straight-line rents;(ii)amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles;(iii)amortization of management contracts;(iv)amortization of debt premiums and discounts and financing costs, net of amounts capitalized, and;(v)stock compensation amortization expense.We use AFFO to (i) assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies; (ii) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods; (iii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iv) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; and (v) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results.Limitations on the use of our FFO measuresWhile we believe our modified FFO measures are important supplemental measures, neither NAREIT's nor our measures of FFO should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under GAAP and are, therefore, limited as an analytical tool. Accordingly, these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business.  Some of the limitations are:The current income tax expenses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures represent the taxes that are payable.Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from FFO. FFO is limited, as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets. Furthermore, the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of logistics facilities are not reflected in FFO.Gains or losses from property dispositions and impairment charges related to expected dispositions represent changes in value of the properties. By excluding these gains and losses, FFO does not capture realized changes in the value of disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions.The deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset or liability that may have to be settled at some future point. Our modified FFO measures do not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement.The foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures are generally recognized based on movements in foreign currency exchange rates through a specific point in time. The ultimate settlement of our foreign currency-denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount. Our FFO measures are limited in that they do not reflect the current period changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements.The gains and losses on extinguishment of debt or preferred stock that we exclude from our Core FFO, may provide a benefit or cost to us as we may be settling our obligation at less or more than our future obligation.The natural disaster expenses that we exclude from Core FFO are costs that we have incurred.We compensate for these limitations by using our FFO measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under GAAP when making our decisions. This information should be read with our complete Consolidated Financial Statements prepared under GAAP. To assist investors in compensating for these limitations, we reconcile our modified FFO measures to our net earnings computed under GAAP.Guidance. The following is a reconciliation of our annual guided Net Earnings per share to our guided Core FFO per share:LowHighNet earnings attributable to common stockholders (a)$3.10$3.25Our share of:Depreciation and amortization2.742.79Net gains on real estate transactions, net of taxes(0.45)(0.57)Unrealized foreign currency losses (gains), losses (gains) on early extinguishment of debt and other, net0.030.03Core FFO attributable to common stockholders/unitholders$5.42$5.50(a) Earnings guidance includes potential future gains recognized from real estate transactions, but excludes futureforeign currency or derivative gains or losses as these items are difficult to predict.Market Capitalization equals Market Equity, less liquidation preference of the preferred shares/units, plus our share of total debt.Market Equity equals outstanding shares of common stock and units multiplied by the closing stock price plus the liquidation preference of the preferred shares/units.Net Promote Income is promote revenue earned from third-party investors during the period, net of related cash and stock compensation expenses, and taxes and foreign currency derivative gains and losses, if applicable.Operating Portfolio represents industrial properties in our Owned and Managed portfolio that have reached Stabilization. Assets held for sale, Non-Strategic Assets and non-industrial assets are excluded from the portfolio. Prologis Share of NOI excludes termination fees and adjustments and includes NOI for the properties contributed to or acquired from co-investment ventures at our actual share prior to and subsequent to change in ownership.Owned and Managed represents the consolidated properties as well as properties owned by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, which we manage.Prologis Share represents our proportionate economic ownership of each entity, or property included in our total Owned and Managed portfolio, whether consolidated or unconsolidated.Rent Change (Cash) represents the percentage change in starting rental rates per the lease agreement, on new and renewed leases, commenced during the period compared with the previous ending rental rates in that same space. This measure excludes any short-term leases of less than one-year, holdover payments, free rent periods and introductory (teaser rates) defined as 50% or less of the stabilized rate.Rent Change (Net Effective) represents the percentage change in net effective rental rates (average rate over the lease term), on new and renewed leases, commenced during the period compared with the previous net effective rental rates in that same space. This measure excludes any short-term leases of less than one year and holdover payments.Retention is the square footage of all leases commenced during the period that are rented by existing tenants divided by the square footage of all expiring and in-place leases during the reporting period. The square footage of tenants that default or buy-out prior to expiration of their lease and short-term leases of less than one year, are not included in the calculation.Same Store. Our same store metrics are non-GAAP financial measures, which are commonly used in the real estate industry and expected from the financial community, on both a net effective and cash basis. We evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a ""same store"" analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, which allows us and investors to analyze our ongoing business operations. We determine our same store metrics on property NOI, which is calculated as rental revenue less rental expense for the applicable properties in the same store population for both consolidated and unconsolidated properties based on our ownership interest, as further defined below.We define our same store population for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as the properties in our Owned and Managed Operating Portfolio, including the property NOI for both consolidated properties and properties owned by the unconsolidated co-investment ventures at January 1, 2022 and owned throughout the same three-month period in both 2022 and 2023.We believe the drivers of property NOI for the consolidated portfolio are generally the same for the properties owned by the ventures in which we invest and therefore we evaluate the same store metrics of the Owned and Managed portfolio based on Prologis' ownership in the properties (""Prologis Share""). The same store population excludes properties held for sale to third parties, along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the period (January 1, 2022) and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period. To derive an appropriate measure of period-to-period operating performance, we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the reported period-end exchange rate to translate from local currency into the U.S. dollar, for both periods.As non-GAAP financial measures, the same store metrics have certain limitations as an analytical tool and may vary among real estate companies. As a result, we provide a reconciliation of Rental Revenues less Rental Expenses (""Property NOI"") (from our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP) to our Same Store Property NOI measures, as follows:Three Months EndedMarch 31,dollars in thousands20232022   Change (%)Reconciliation of Consolidated Property NOI to Same Store Property NOI measures:Rental revenues$1,633,770$1,076,861Rental expenses(412,554)(275,674)Consolidated Property NOI$1,221,216$801,187Adjustments to derive same store results:Property NOI from consolidated properties not included in same     store portfolio and other adjustments (a)(417,921)(70,637)Property NOI from unconsolidated co-investment ventures included     in same store portfolio (a)(b)701,051644,713Third parties' share of Property NOI from properties included in     same store portfolio (a)(b)(567,041)(522,181)Prologis Share of Same Store Property NOI – Net Effective (b)$937,305$853,0829.9 %Consolidated properties straight-line rent and fair value lease     adjustments included in the same store portfolio (c)(17,511)(23,399)Unconsolidated co-investment ventures straight-line rent and fair     value lease adjustments included in the same store portfolio (c)(7,361)(23,599)Third parties' share of straight-line rent and fair value lease      adjustments included in the same store portfolio (b)(c)5,74918,081Prologis Share of Same Store Property NOI – Cash (b)(c)$918,182$824,16511.4 %(a) We exclude properties held for sale to third parties, along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the period and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period. We also exclude net termination and renegotiation fees to allow us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property's rental revenues without regard to one-time items that are not indicative of the property's recurring operating performance. Net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate or renegotiate their lease, offset by the write-off of the asset recorded due to the adjustment to straight-line rents over the lease term. Same Store Property NOI is adjusted to include an allocation of property management expenses for our consolidated properties based on the property management services provided to each property (generally, based on a percentage of revenues). On consolidation, these amounts are eliminated and the actual costs of providing property management and leasing services are recognized as part of our consolidated rental expense.(b) We include the Property NOI for the same store portfolio for both consolidated properties and properties owned by the co-investment ventures based on our investment in the underlying properties. In order to calculate our share of Same Store Property NOI from the co-investment ventures in which we own less than 100%, we use the co-investment ventures' underlying Property NOI for the same store portfolio and apply our ownership percentage at March 31, 2023 to the Property NOI for both periods, including the properties contributed during the period. We adjust the total Property NOI from the same store portfolio of the co-investment ventures by subtracting the third parties' share of both consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures.During the periods presented, certain wholly-owned properties were contributed to a co-investment venture and are included in the same store portfolio. Neither our consolidated results nor those of the co-investment ventures, when viewed individually, would be comparable on a same store basis because of the changes in composition of the respective portfolios from period to period (e.g. the results of a contributed property are included in our consolidated results through the contribution date and in the results of the venture subsequent to the contribution date based on our ownership interest at the end of the period). As a result, only line items labeled ""Prologis Share of Same Store Property NOI"" are comparable period over period.(c) We further remove certain noncash items (straight-line rent and amortization of fair value lease adjustments) included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP to reflect a Same Store Property NOI – Cash measure. We manage our business and compensate our executives based on the same store results of our Owned and Managed portfolio at 100% as we manage our portfolio on an ownership blind basis. We calculate those results by including 100% of the properties included in our same store portfolio.Stabilization is defined as the earlier of when a property that was developed has been completed for one year, is contributed to a co-investment venture following completion or is 90% occupied. Upon Stabilization, a property is moved into our Operating Portfolio.Weighted Average Interest Rate is based on the effective rate, which includes the amortization of related premiums and discounts and finance costs.Weighted Average Stabilized Capitalization (""Cap"") Rate is calculated as Stabilized NOI divided by the Acquisition Price.Prologis.

234,3f1dbc88-c2f4-3d49-9ece-b50c603d8e77,PLD,2023-04-18,Key Factors to Impact Prologis (PLD) This Earnings Season,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/key-factors-impact-prologis-pld-143502431.html,1681742102,STORY,['PLD'],"[Prologis, Inc. PLD is slated to report first-quarter 2023 earnings on Apr 18 before the bell. The company’s quarterly results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 2.48% in terms of FFO per share. Results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues, driven by healthy leasing activity and solid rent growth.Over the trailing four quarters, Prologis beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in terms of FFO per share on three occasions and missed the same on the other, the average beat being 1.53%. This is depicted in the graph below:Prologis, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePrologis, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePrologis, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Prologis, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Factors at PlayPer a Cushman &amp; Wakefield CWK report, in the first quarter, industrial demand has moved back to “normalized levels”, but it “still powers forward”. Amid high inflation and high-interest rates, slowing consumer demand and uncertainty in the economy, U.S. leasing totals witnessed a 9.4% decline from the prior quarter, with 136.9 million square feet (msf) of deals being signed in the first quarter. However, this total was in sync with the quarterly average achieved pre-pandemic.There has been a flight to quality by logistic tenants, with tenants executing 59.1 msf of deals in industrial facilities built since 2020 during the quarter, marking 46.4% of the total. First-quarter net absorption came in at 62.5 msf. Although moderating, it was still comparable to quarterly totals recorded earlier in the expansion cycle, i.e., from 2016 to 2019.Amid the normalization of demand and the spate of speculative deliveries, there has been an uptick in the overall U.S. industrial vacancy rate, which moved higher by 40 basis points (bps) in the first quarter to 3.6%. However, it is still lower than the 10-year historical average of 5.3%.Moreover, asking rental rate growth remained high during the quarter. The same increased 3.5% sequentially, reaching another new high of $9.19 per square foot (psf) and surpassing the $9.00-psf mark for the first time.Amid these, PLD is well-poised to benefit from this favorable trend, given its capacity to offer modern logistics facilities at strategic in-fill locations. Moreover, with global supply chains transforming for faster fulfillment and resilience, Prologis is likely to have captured favorable fundamentals with its differentiated customer offerings and solid investment activity in the to-be-reported quarter.Prologis’ expansion efforts through acquisitions and developments in recent years are likely to have boosted the top line in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, PLD is likely to have gained from its industry-leading cost structure.Moreover, Prologis has decent balance sheet strength to fuel its growth endeavors. A market leader, this industrial REIT has the ability to raise capital at favorable rates. It is likely to have maintained financial strength with liquidity during the period in discussion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $1.63 billion, suggesting a nearly 51% year-over-year jump. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share of $1.21 calls for an 11.01% increase year over year.Our estimate for development management and other revenues is presently pegged at $5.2 million for the first quarter. Our estimate for first-quarter average occupancy is 97.5%, suggesting a 30-basis point decline from the prior quarter.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Prologis this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is not the case here.Prologis currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of -1.37%.

Many posted better-than-expected results, exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations. And now, we’ll remain busy sorting through quarterly results daily, as we’re just starting the 2023 Q1 season.This week, several big-time names in the Zacks Finance sector, Discover Financial Services DFS and American Express AXP, will deliver their quarterly results.

Let’s take a closer look at how each company stacks up heading into earnings.Discover Financial ServicesAnalysts have primarily had an optimistic view of Discover’s upcoming release, with three positive earnings estimate revisions hitting the tape over the last 60 days.

238,c84d58b1-fabd-31fa-a1f2-c87ae75b6d85,AXP,2023-04-18,Here's What You Should Know Ahead of AmEx (AXP) Q1 Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-know-ahead-amex-axp-131701268.html,1681737421,STORY,"['AXP', 'AON']","[American Express Company AXP is set to report first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 20, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the diversified financial services company’s adjusted earnings per share of $2.07 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.1%, primarily due to higher operating and customer engagement costs. Weakness in International Card Services and Commercial Services businesses affected AmEx’s profit levels. The negatives were partially offset by continued business momentum, better volumes and higher Card Member spending.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the first-quarter earnings announcement.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.70 per share for first-quarter earnings has remained stable over the past week. The consensus mark indicates a 1.1% decline from the year-ago reported figure, while our estimate suggests a 4.3% fall. American Express beat earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering an average surprise of 4.5%. This is depicted in the graph below.American Express Company Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company price-eps-surprise | American Express Company QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $14 billion, suggesting a jump of 19% from the year-ago reported figure. We expect first-quarter revenues to witness a 19.5% year-over-year increase.Factors to NoteAmerican Express is likely to have witnessed improved volumes in the to-be-reported quarter, a trend seen over the last several quarters. It is expected to have increased due to total network volumes and billed business volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter total network volumes indicates 15.9% year-over-year growth, while our estimate suggests a 21.6% increase.An overall resilient consumer spending level is likely to have supported Discount revenues, AXP’s largest revenue driver. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Discount revenues indicates 15.5% year-over-year growth, while our estimate suggests an 18.7% increase.Story continuesTravel and Entertainment (T&amp;E) is rapidly increasing in most parts of the world, overcoming the COVID-19 woes. T&amp;E-related spending is likely to have jumped in the quarter under review. Fees, commissions and other revenues are expected to have improved on the back of an uptick in travel-related revenues. As such, card acquisitions in some of AXP’s largest travel co-brand portfolios are anticipated to have expanded.Cards-in-force is expected to have witnessed an uptick in the quarter under review. While the consensus mark for total cards-in-force indicates a 9.6% year-over-year increase, our estimate suggests 10.2% growth.American Express’s interest income, the second-largest revenue contributor, is likely to have risen on higher loan disbursements. The consensus mark for AXP’s interest income suggests an upside of 59.7% from the year-ago reported figure. We expect the figure to increase 39.1% from the year-ago period. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Merchant and Network Services’ pre-tax income indicates a 6.5% year-over-year increase while our estimate suggests an 8% jump.The above-mentioned factors are likely to have contributed to AXP’s first-quarter performance. However, the rising expenses in global commercial services, card member rewards, marketing and business development are expected to have reduced margins, making an earnings beat uncertain. Our estimate suggests total expenses to have witnessed a 20.2% year-over-year increase in the quarter, which is likely to have reduced profit levels.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for American Express this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -1.45%.

240,fc375b53-0293-309a-8ef6-1ee5798aa01c,OXY,2023-04-18,"INSIGHT-Facing brutal climate math, US bets billions on direct air capture",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insight-facing-brutal-climate-math-100000755.html,1681812000,STORY,['OXY'],"[*Nine or more applications seen; goal in a few years is four hubs*All bidding for slice of $3.5 bln in govt grants*Climeworks bids for three sites; plans 100 hires by 2025*Unproven tech, talent shortage, costs — all challengesBy Susanna Twidale, Valerie Volcovici, Simon Jessop and Peter HendersonApril 18 (Reuters) - The world is failing to cut carbon emissions fast enough to avoid disastrous climate change, a dawning truth that is giving life to a technology that for years has been marginal – pulling carbon dioxide from the air.Leading the charge, the U.S. government has offered $3.5 billion in grants to build the factories that will capture and permanently store the gas - the largest such effort globally to help halt climate change through Direct Air Capture (DAC) and expanded a tax credit to $180/tonne to bolster the burgeoning technology.The sums involved dwarf funding available in other regions, such as Britain which has pledged up to 100 million pounds ($124 million) for DAC research and development. That compares with $12 billion in federal spending to drive demand for personal and commercial electric vehicles, Boston Consulting Group estimated.While bids for the U.S. DAC hub funding were due on March 13, the government and some companies have yet to fully disclose details about the applications, many of which Reuters is reporting for the first time. The Energy Department expects to announce winning bids this summer.Worsening climate change and inadequate efforts to cut emissions have thrust the issue known as carbon removal to the top of the agenda, and U.N. scientists now estimate billions of tonnes of carbon will need to be sucked out of the atmosphere annually to reach a goal of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius.While much of that will come from natural solutions such as planting more trees or increasing the ability of soil to sequester carbon, permanent carbon removal like DAC will also be needed.Story continuesYet the list of hurdles is long.The biggest plant to-date is capturing only 4,000 tonnes a year and costs are high, the talent pool is fledgling and corporate buyers for the credits largely remain on the sidelines. The role of oil companies in the space has also raised eyebrows and developers must muster support for hubs from communities that have often been damaged by big energy projects.Plus, the CO2 must be stored permanently.The U.S. government has said it wants to back four hubs, and interviews with more than 20 state, federal, company and investor sources show at least nine applications have been filed in a first round, with two major Occidental Petroleum projects also seen as strong contenders.Among the most active firms so far has been Swiss start-up Climeworks, which has raised more than $800 million to date and is backed by Singaporean sovereign investor GIC.In his first major interview since taking part in applications for three hubs - in Louisiana, California and North Dakota - Chief Executive Christoph Gebald said all had the potential to be scaled to the U.S. government's target of a million tonnes, known as a megatonne, a year.The company planned to boost headcount from the low double-digits to more than 100 over the next 18 months, and by 2030, the three hubs could create 3,500 direct jobs and tens of thousands of indirect jobs, if given the green light, he said.The real challenge, though, was access to talent, Gebald said. ""Where are you getting those people in the next 30 years?... there’s no university programme on DAC.""Gebald said it would cost ""easily in the billions"" of dollars to create a megatonne facility and the firm could look to raise funds depending on the success of its three bids, although it would likely wait until 2024 to return to the market.""The lion's share of the capital is for assets, so it really depends on the build out programme.""Another bidding for funding is start-up Carbon Capture, in partnership with Frontier Carbon Solutions and a new company called Twelve, which will use captured carbon to make sustainable aviation fuel in Wyoming, Jonas Lee, chief commercial officer for Carbon Capture, told Reuters.""This industry is fragile right now, but all the arrows are lined up in the right direction. Now, we have to do our job which is to put iron in the ground and start taking out meaningful amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere,"" Lee said.""Hopefully that will help in a virtuous cycle that galvanizes even more support from corporations buying carbon credits, and maybe from state and local governments.""OIL INVOLVEMENTThe sites being bid for stretch across the breadth of the country, yet all have several things in common: they are near cheap, renewable energy and plenty of space to store the gas.Unsurprisingly, perhaps, that has drawn the attention of some of the large, incumbent energy giants keen to position themselves for what could be a multi-trillion-dollar industry as demand for fossil fuels subsides.Occidental Petroleum has said it is well positioned for federal grants for what could be the biggest Direct Air Capture plants in the world. It declined to say whether it had applied for support for two DAC projects it is developing in Texas.Oil companies are also far ahead in getting permitted, sequestration wells, guaranteed to keep the CO2 in the ground.“We have the pore space to begin with, from the reservoirs that are depleted or depleting, that we've operated that now can be repurposed into sequestration by the engineers who know how that reservoir reacts,” said Chris Gould, chief sustainability officer, at California Resources Corp, an oil company that aims for net zero emissions and is working with Climeworks on a California project.But the oil companies are still looked at with scepticism by some in the carbon removal community.""It's really essential for the success of direct air capture that this be about removing legacy emissions and not be about continued fossil fuel use,"" said Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon 180, a DAC consultancy. ""We're hoping to see hubs that don't have ties to fossil fuel production.""COSTSMost DAC processes use a liquid or solid that is engineered to naturally soak up carbon dioxide, then heated or treated to extract the carbon to be put underground.But the energy to run the process, the factories, pipelines and storage is expensive. The jury is still out on whether it can be deployed at a scale big enough to affect the climate, at a cost the world can bear.Across a range of technical processes, it can cost more than $1,000 to capture and lock away a ton of planet-warming carbon dioxide, yet the U.S. government has targeted a $100 a ton price tag.Heirloom Carbon, a California company which with Climeworks is part of an application for a Louisiana hub, sees that as a realistic goal, while Carbon Capture told Reuters it expects to hit $250 a ton by 2030 and $150 a ton within a decade.To get to a cost and scale that can affect the planet will mean designing an easily duplicated plant that does the same thing over and over again, like a franchised fast-food restaurant, said Dan Friedmann, chief executive of DAC firm Carbon Engineering, which is supplying technology to Occidental.“It's a McDonald's kind of thing,"" he said.

241,a4e2bd2d-6cd8-3853-a9c7-5f56ca9a792b,BSX,2023-04-18,Boston Scientific Corporation's (NYSE:BSX) Stock Is Rallying But Financials Look Ambiguous: Will The Momentum Continue?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boston-scientific-corporations-nyse-bsx-110051460.html,1681815651,STORY,['BSX'],"[Boston Scientific's (NYSE:BSX) stock is up by a considerable 12% over the past three months. However, we wonder if the company's inconsistent financials would have any adverse impact on the current share price momentum. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Boston Scientific's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Boston Scientific How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Boston Scientific is:4.0% = US$698m ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.04 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Boston Scientific's Earnings Growth And 4.0% ROEIt is quite clear that Boston Scientific's ROE is rather low. Even when compared to the industry average of 10%, the ROE figure is pretty disappointing. Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 4.1% seen by Boston Scientific over the last five years is not surprising. We believe that there also might be other aspects that are negatively influencing the company's earnings prospects. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Boston Scientific's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 14% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Boston Scientific is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Boston Scientific Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Boston Scientific doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which doesn't explain why the company's earnings have shrunk if it is retaining all of its profits. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.SummaryOverall, we have mixed feelings about Boston Scientific. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

Poring over our annual employee survey results, we were taken aback to learn - much to our chagrin - that not all of our female employees felt they had equal opportunities for promotion as their male counterparts. We took a collective deep breath to let the realization sink in: A swath of our workforce was letting us know that they felt overlooked. We knew immediately that we needed to do better for them - and not only because diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) align with our values, but because in medtech, DEI is a business imperative.Why do I say so?

The company's revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Trulicity, Taltz and others. Lilly expects to launch four new medicines by 2023 end with Mounjaro for type II diabetes already launched and cancer drug Jaypirca already approved.Mounjaro is off to a solid start. However, the CRL for donanemab and mirikizumab will probably delay potential launch of the candidates by several months.Generic competition for several drugs, rising pricing pressure in the United States mainly on key drugs, Trulicity, and price cuts in some international markets like China, Japan and Europe are a few top-line headwinds. Estimates have gone up slightly ahead of Q1 results. Lilly has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters.(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+3.0% vs. -11.1%). The company's robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising.During the fourth quarter, the company opened a new bioanalytical lab in Richmond, VA to support its clinical research business. The integration of PPD is largely complete and drove strong returns for the shareholders with outstanding execution and business performance throughout the year.However, revenues within Europe declined in the low teens.

Lockheed expects to deliver 147 to 153 F-35 aircraft in 2023 and 2024.However, America and Turkey's tiff as a result of the latter accepting Russian products may hurt its component supply from Turkey. Lockheed is facing performance issues concerning some of its products, which may hurt its results.

Some 400 union members, including drivers, warehouse, and production workers, as well as sales and marketing staff, are employed at the plant.According to a Teamsters manager, the union engaged in about 18 rounds of bargaining with Liberty—to no avail. Members “overwhelmingly” rejected signing a new contract that was called “insulting” in a union statement. Union members’ previous contract expired on April 15.“We presented a contract for our 400 members that offers the highest wage increases in Coca-Cola/Teamster Local 830’s history, along with a generous health and welfare benefits package,” Liberty Coca-Cola said in a statement.But union leadership disputes the “generous” nature of Liberty’s offer. “It’s not what you need to stay up in today’s inflationary times,” said Daniel H. Grace, Teamsters Local 830 secretary-treasurer, in an interview with NBC10 Philadelphia.The union hopes to return to the negotiating table with Liberty as early as April 18, according to a Teamsters Local 830 spokesperson.Quotable“Compensation is a huge sticking point, as is their unwillingness to budge on a fair benefits package for our members. Liberty Coca-Cola knows that our Local 830 members are the driving force behind their operations and success, yet they think they can treat us like second-class citizens. We won’t stand for it.” –A statement from Daniel H. Grace, Teamsters 830 secretary-treasurerUnion leadership didn’t support the proposed contract, despite Liberty’s claimsLiberty said in its statement that Grace “endorsed” the proposed contract rejected by union members. But the claim is “utterly disingenuous and misleading,” Grace responded in an email to Quartz.Story continues“The document they referenced in their statement was a simple acknowledgement that I agreed to take the proposal to my membership for a vote,” he added. “They knew that to be the case. It was absolutely not an acceptance of their offer.”How long will the Liberty Coca-Cola strike last?The union plans to strike until the contract dispute is settled. The last time Local 830 went on strike in Philadelphia was in 2004, for two weeks.Liberty said it has a “contingency plan” in place to continue its operations, which include the distribution of not just Coca-Cola but also products like Dasani, Dr. Pepper, and Sprite to thousands of retailers across New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.Labor action at other Coca-Cola franchisesWorkers at other Coca-Cola plants both in the US and overseas have also fought with management in recent years over pay and benefits.In December 2021, members of Teamsters Local 773 went on strike at a Coca-Cola plant in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in order to maintain their pensions. They picketed for almost six weeks before reaching a contractual agreement.Last summer, workers in Yorkshire, England, threatened to go on strike over a pay offer from their employer, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, stating it amounted to a wage cut despite the franchise’s £1.6 billion ($1.98 billion) in profit for 2021.Related stories🎭 Hollywood has two weeks to reach a union deal if it wants to avoid a writers’ strike🩺 UK doctors are striking over being paid $17.40 an hour☕ Starbucks fired the employee who ignited unionization at the companyMore from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowWhat were the world's busiest airports in 2022?Sign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

247,29a018a9-6d95-38aa-aaa6-a50384930440,KO,2023-04-18,Coca-Cola (KO) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-ko-earnings-expected-140002770.html,1681740002,STORY,['KO'],"[Coca-Cola (KO) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest beverage maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.65 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +1.6%.Revenues are expected to be $10.86 billion, up 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Coke?For Coke, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.41%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Coke will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Coke would post earnings of $0.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.45, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Coke doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""Our partnerships with local high schools, solar providers, and nonprofits continue to be instrumental in our efforts to create renewable energy programs that offer durable benefits for these communities today and into the future.""Bringing Solar Power and Job Opportunities to California CommunitiesIn partnership with GRID Alternatives, a nonprofit that designs and implements community-first projects that bring solar power and solar jobs to the people, Intuit is paving the way for Compton, California, families to go solar at home. This aligns with Intuit’s commitment to invest in the Los Angeles community and the areas surrounding Intuit Dome, the LA Clippers’ new arena opening in Inglewood in 2024. Intuit has also funded a grant as part of GRID Alternatives’ Tribal Solar Accelerator Fund program, which fosters Indigenous energy sovereignty and expands solar job opportunities in tribal communities across the US. The grant was awarded to the Big Pine Paiute Tribe, near Bishop, California, to install solar panels on a community building.Story continues""Working with leading companies such as Intuit is critical toward achieving our vision of a transition to clean energy that includes everyone,"" said Erica Mackie, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of GRID Alternatives. ""Together we can expand access to solar power and green jobs, and build community-powered solutions that advance economic and environmental justice through renewable energy.""Delivering Carbon Reduction Solutions to Tennessee CommunitiesSince 2021, Intuit has engaged with Clearloop, a Nashville-based carbon solutions platform accelerating decarbonization and expanding access to clean energy in American communities where the greatest economic and environmental benefits can be achieved. Intuit’s support helped make possible the construction of a project in Jackson, Tennessee that will reclaim 60 million pounds of CO2 over its lifetime operation, and has since supported 1 megawatt of a new solar project near an Intuit Prosperity Hub in East Tennessee.On track for completion in winter 2023, the solar project commissioned by Clearloop will reclaim over 139 million pounds of carbon from the electric grid, provide green power to local institutions, and create workforce development opportunities in the region.""Our partnership with Intuit fuels Clearloop’s commitment to expand access to clean energy and bring economic development and affordable, renewable energy to communities where the dollar investment can go further and the environmental impact can be maximized,"" said Laura Zapata, CEO and co-founder of Clearloop. ""Working with Intuit, we can provide a unique opportunity to support forward-looking communities with the economic boost that renewable energy and the accompanying infrastructure bring.""Innovative Multiyear Fund Providing Solar Power, Apprenticeships, and Educational Opportunities in Coal CountryIntuit recently launched the Coalfield Solar Fund, a partnership between Intuit, The National Energy and Education Development (NEED) Project, a nonprofit educational organization, and Secure Solar Futures, a provider of on-site clean energy and educational programs to K-12 public schools and colleges. The Fund is an innovative partnership that provides multiyear grant funding to help bring solar power, job training, and hands-on student learning opportunities in the solar energy industry to communities in Virginia and West Virginia. Intuit is building off the success of its earlier collaboration with Secure Solar Futures on a solar project in Wise, Virginia—an Intuit Prosperity Hub location—with the Coalfield Solar Fund.Interested schools and colleges can apply to the program by April 17, 2023. Applications, webinar details and signup, along with more information about the Coalfield Solar Fund, can be found at the program’s website: www.coalfieldsolarfund.org.""Intuit has a track record, through its Prosperity Hub and sustainability programs, of bringing jobs and climate solutions to underserved communities, where new workforce development opportunities bring economic impact at scale,"" said Ryan McAllister, CEO of Secure Solar Futures. ""Their partnership accelerates our ability to bring solar energy, STEM education programs and career opportunities to schools in Virginia and West Virginia. We share Intuit’s vision for creating bold programs that benefit the community in a myriad of ways.""For more information about Intuit’s climate-positive commitment, visit https://www.intuit.com/company/corporate-responsibility/climate/.About IntuitIntuit is the global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for the people and communities we serve.

You do need to know the basis of your home so you can calculate the accurate gain so you can determine whether or not that it is a taxable gain or exempt gain.LISA GREENE-LEWIS: Crypto is just like a stock investment if you are holding on to it as an investment.

So if you lose out on a credit in one year versus the last, it can have a much more impactful change on your ultimate tax liability.ROBERT POWELL: If you have a very complicated return, then you probably could be raising a red flag.

The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters while missing in one.Let’s see how things are shaping up for General Electric this earnings season.Factors to NoteContinued recovery in the commercial market and robust consumer demand are likely to have aided GE’s Aerospace segment in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aerospace segment revenues in the first quarter indicates a 22.7% jump from the year-ago reported number. Also, after months of softness, a rebound in demand in the Power segment is likely to have driven the company’s performance.However, lower U.S. onshore wind volumes and continued pressure from onshore North American market dynamics are likely to have dented the orders in the Renewable Energy segment. Supply chain disruptions, including labor and material shortages and high logistics costs are expected to have weighted on General Electric’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Given the company’s substantial international presence, foreign-currency headwinds are likely to have hurt the top line in the first quarter too.General Electric Company Price and EPS SurpriseGeneral Electric Company Price and EPS SurpriseGeneral Electric Company price-eps-surprise | General Electric Company QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for GE’s revenues in the first quarter suggests a 21.4% decrease from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.

The bottom line increased 34.8% year over year driven by higher revenues. Total revenues of $21,786 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21,938 million. However, the top line increased 7% year over year driven by strong performance of the Aerospace, Power and healthcare segments.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as according to our model, these too have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle.Caterpillar CAT has an Earnings ESP of +2.54% and a Zacks Rank #3.

As always, earnings results and guidance will be critical in determining the state of the broader economy, and how investors decide to position their portfolios.These stocks cover three different, but important sectors of the economy. Together their earnings results should provide some very valuable insights into consumers, and economy.TeslaTesla TSLA had a very strong start to the year, up nearly 50% YTD. However, the stock price made all those gains in the first six weeks of 2023. TSLA has since traded sideways and has now built out a significant consolidation.It isn’t abundantly clear from this chart whether TSLA stock will break higher or lower, but the direction it does break will be very significant. As a leading stock in the market, it may signal the next direction of the broader indexes.Breakout, and the bull market is back on. Breakdown, and there may be more pain ahead for the market. It seems very possible that TSLA breaks out of this range after its earnings report. Tesla reports Wednesday, April 19 after the market closes.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewTesla currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating mixed earnings revisions. Sales growth for the current quarter is expected to be strong. Estimates are projecting 26% YoY growth to $24 billion. But earnings are projected to compress -21% YoY to $0.85 per share.Analysts have lowered earnings expectations for the current quarter and current year but raised estimates for the next quarter and FY24. That strong sales growth is hard to ignore, and the increasing popularity of electric vehicles should be a tailwind for TSLA for a long time.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAfter TSLA stock corrected -75% over the last year, its valuation has become far more reasonable. Tesla is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 54x, which is above the industry average of 32x, and well below its two-year median of 109x. TSLA was trading as high as 300x earnings over the last two years.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTaiwan SemiconductorTaiwan Semiconductor TSM, one of the world's largest producers of semiconductors, reports earnings Thursday, April 20, before the market opens.Taiwan Semiconductor is like Tesla in that it started the year off very strong, up 18% YTD but has traded sideways over the last couple of months. TSM’s chart looks a bit more ominous than TSLA, hovering just above the bottom of the range. TSM looks close to breaking down below the $85 level. It seems the market is waiting for both stocks to report before making the next big move.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewTSM is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, indicating mixed earnings revisions. Sales and earnings estimates are definitely a mixed bag going forward. Current quarter sales are expected to be nearly flat YoY, while earnings are projected to drop -14% to $1.21 per share.Analysts are expecting some trouble in the semiconductor industry in the current year, but expectations resume the uptrend for FY24. Sales are expected to climb 14% to $90 billion, and earnings are expected to grow 17% to $6.54 per share in 2024.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTSM is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 16x, which is below the market average of 19x, and below its five-year median of 20x. After a challenging couple of years, TSM has come way off its high valuation and currently looks very appealing. TSM also offers a 1.65% dividend yield.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSemiconductor sales are an important bellwether for the broader economy. While at the beginning of the year, it was a consensus that the world economy would experience a considerable slowdown, that prediction has yet to come to fruition. The economy continues to remain robust, so maybe the recent weakness in the TSM chart is just a fake out before the next leg higher.Procter and GambleProcter and Gamble PG, the consumer staples giant is another great American company, whose earnings results provide insight into the general economy. Consumer staples should see consistent sales during good and bad times, as they are necessities for many consumers. Misses in sales could mean that consumers are really hurting.Procter and Gamble currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating mixed earnings expectations. Current quarter sales and earnings growth are expected to be nearly flat YoY, but current quarter earnings have been revised lower over the last three months. The next few reporting periods expect a rebound in growth though.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPG is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 26x, which is above the market average of 19x and its five-year median of 24x. Procter and Gamble has been a safe haven over the last two years and has outperformed the market. Further encouraging investors to buy PG is its dividend yield of 2.5%, which it has increased 7% annually over the last three years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs the economy has remained strong so too has PG, but there are risks to PG’s bottom line other than growth. Inflation remains the primary risk for PG as higher commodity costs, and labor costs shrink profits. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Let's take a sector-by-sector look. Here with more, Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith. Hey, Brad.BRAD SMITH: Hey, Rochelle. Great to see you here. As we kick off another trading weekend, you know what that means? Yes, the earnings season rolls. Of course, we had some of the big banks plus Delta Airlines and a little bit of a shock drop from American Airlines last week. But now this week, we're zeroing in on a few big names here. I've got the NASDAQ 100 pulled up as one of the themes is going to be the early tech trade, and particularly some of those Dow components.Now, IBM is going to be one of those companies that we're going to be watching for later on this week. As of right now, kicks off this week down by about 2/10 of a percent. But one of those other big names is going to be Netflix as well. That one, of course, within the NASDAQ 100. And for Netflix, we're actually be looking for revenue to come in at about $8.18 billion with EPS coming in at $2.89.That's some of the expectations, some of the key themes, of course, to keep a close eye on as the company has already started to enact some of the cost mechanisms for themselves as it comes to pricing tiers not just on the advertising model side but then also cracking down on password sharing and account sharing. So with that in mind, keep a close eye on some of those subscriber numbers as well as how much they continue to spend.Another company that we're going to be keeping an eye on within tech-- Tesla here. And we're taking a look at shares there. You're seeing those down by about 1%. Year to date coming into this report, you're seeing it lower-- or excuse me-- higher 50% year to date. And then additionally, it's important to keep in mind two big themes for this company.Story continuesOne of them is going to be not only EV demand but at what price here, because that is where they have really kicked off this pricing war within the electric vehicle landscape, and then additionally on the front of Tesla and Elon Musk, what they have to signal about that profitability on the back of some of the deliveries, the production figures that they've been able to already announce over the course of the first quarter in 2023.The expectations there, just briefly-- $23.43-- we'll round it off-- $2 billion is what they're expected to see in revenue based on consensus estimates from Bloomberg. And then additionally, EPS, that expected to come in about $0.86 a share for Tesla, which would represent a move higher on the EPS front by about 2% year over year. Also going to be keeping close tabs on the banking sector as well here, which I know you're going to be talking a little bit more about.But just a preview, Bank of America-- we're going to have a little bit more of a deep dive on this later on this week-- that's actually expected to see two big themes to really pull through for it. Look for retail. Look for the health of the consumer. Of course, as we've gotten even more of that commentary about the health of the consumer and the resilience of consumer accounts, we've already started to see that come through from companies like JPMorgan.But in this particular case, what makes Bank of America that much more important is it being perhaps the largest consumer-facing type of bank. And so with that in mind, continue to keep an eye on Bank of America shares. The expectations there-- it's actually for an EPS growth year over year of about 2% and for revenue to come in at $25.32 billion with EPS earnings per share coming in at about $0.81. I can't read my chicken scratch on my own notes, but about $0.81, $0.82 on an adjusted basis there.And then lastly, I'll just leave you with Procter &amp; Gamble, of course, one of the components that we're going to be tracking closely as we move on throughout the rest of this week here. But PG here on the day-- you're seeing that up by about 2/10 of a percent. Year to date, it's down by 2/10 of a percent, though, and so we'll see exactly what the company has to say around pricing for some of those consumer goods, where they're still seeing volumes move through.That's going to be a key word to perhaps Command-F or Control-F within the earnings report when that comes through. And then additionally, on the supply chain management, there's this larger talk about if there is-- or determining, rather-- inflation versus what some have called greedflation, even. And some of the prices continuing to remain higher though some of the largest impacts of the supply chain that have impacted prices in the past have mitigated themselves. So it'll be interesting to see where some of that risk has abated, at least for Procter &amp; Gamble, and how that sets the tone for some of the other CPG companies out there, Rochelle.- A really interesting look at how all these indicators will add up as we look at the health of the economy and the health overall that we'll see with earnings season. Great stuff there for us. Our very own Brad Smith.]"

A pilot program at Macerich’s Los Cerritos Center demonstrated impressive results, with 56% energy savings over the existing AC induction motors in its rooftop HVAC units.“Macerich has a goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. By working with Motus Power and Turntide, we’re able to accelerate our energy reduction program without impacting our daily operations or shopper experiences,” said Ryan Knudson, vice president of corporate responsibility &amp; sustainability, Macerich. “Like upgrading to LED lighting, retrofitting our HVAC systems with high-efficiency motors offers the benefits of reducing both operating costs and greenhouse gas emissions.”Turntide’s motors are currently in 18 shopping center locations across the U.S. and will scale to more than 20 throughout the year. Across all sites, the projected energy savings will be more than 1.5 million kWh, equating to a carbon reduction of over 1,000 metric tons of CO2. That’s the same environmental impact as using 120,000 fewer gallons of gas or carbon sequestered by 1,258 acres of forests in one year.Retrofitting HVAC is essential in helping the world reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Buildings consume nearly 40% of the world’s energy and account for a similar percentage of global CO2 emissions. HVAC equipment consumes 35% of the energy used in buildings, and 30% of that is wasted by inefficient equipment and controls.Story continues“We are constantly looking for technologies that offer greater energy savings and optimizing HVAC efficiency is a high-impact energy conservation measure that delivers immediate and long-term savings,” said John Huddock, co-founder, Motus Power. “Turntide’s Smart Motor System is a breakthrough technology that provides tremendous benefits for businesses and the environment.”Turntide leveraged recent software, connectivity, and power electronics advances to revolutionize the electronic motor. Like bringing the fixed landline phone into the smartphone age, Turntide’s Smart Motor System integrates a reinvented switched reluctance motor with software-driven intelligence and connectivity to deliver unprecedented efficiency and reliability. Turntide makes sustainability a no-brainer, economically and environmentally — empowering businesses to save money while helping save the planet.“Right now, there is no path to 100% renewable energy sources without drastically reducing the amount of energy we use and modernizing the world’s motors is essential in the fight against climate change,” said Kevin Blakeborough, vice president of channel strategy, Turntide. “An intelligent motor system can minimize energy use and maintenance costs, but also spread savings to broader areas of spending like HVAC and building operations.”About Macerich Macerich is a fully integrated, self-managed, and self-administered real estate investment trust (REIT). As a leading owner, operator, and developer of high-quality retail real estate in densely populated and attractive U.S. markets, Macerich’s portfolio is concentrated in California, the Pacific Northwest, Phoenix/Scottsdale, and the Metro New York to Washington, D.C. corridor.

What perks come to mind? Perhaps kombucha fountains and foosball tables. Now think about the corporate benefits of the past. What comes to mind? Perhaps an on-site fitness center or health care clinic. For Aflac, these traditional benefits have been most helpful in attracting, retaining, and engaging new hires who value perks that create ease over splashiness.The insurance firm has also found that adding more benefits that require its 12,000-person workforce to come into the office to take advantage of them is, well, a great way to entice employees back to the office. It's a strategy that CHRO Matthew Owenby admits might sound ""old school"" to some.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Fortune: There's often a knowledge gap when it comes to benefits. How do you close that for employees?Matthew Owenby: HR people should do better. It's one thing for me to say, 'Hey, I've given you a benefits handbook, and I put it online, so my work is done here.' Wrong. Most people in the workplace spend less than 30 minutes a year determining what their benefits are going to be. They spend far more time searching for a vacation than they do on something that not only affects their financial stability but, in a post-COVID world, can be a financial exposure.

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.33%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.3%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 1.92%.Coming into today, shares of the food and beverage company had gained 4.78% in the past month. In that same time, the Consumer Staples sector gained 5.07%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 5.67%.PepsiCo will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be April 25, 2023. On that day, PepsiCo is projected to report earnings of $1.37 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 6.2%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $17.18 billion, up 6.05% from the year-ago period.PEP's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $7.23 per share and revenue of $89.48 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +6.48% and +3.58%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for PepsiCo. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. PepsiCo is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that PepsiCo has a Forward P/E ratio of 25.39 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 24.83, so we one might conclude that PepsiCo is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesInvestors should also note that PEP has a PEG ratio of 3.33 right now. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PEP's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.94 as of yesterday's close.The Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector.

272,cefca449-2cca-3149-9016-104ef860f7e5,AMP,2023-04-18,Ameriprise Financial Services (AMP) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ameriprise-financial-services-amp-earnings-140002924.html,1681740002,STORY,"['AMP', 'SEIC']","[The market expects Ameriprise Financial Services (AMP) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 24. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis financial services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $7.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +19.1%.Revenues are expected to be $3.7 billion, up 2.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.01% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ameriprise?For Ameriprise, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.57%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Ameriprise will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ameriprise would post earnings of $6.35 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.94, delivering a surprise of +9.29%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ameriprise appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry, SEI Investments (SEIC) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -39.7%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $469.69 million, down 19.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for SEI has been revised 0.1% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -3.48%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that SEI will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
